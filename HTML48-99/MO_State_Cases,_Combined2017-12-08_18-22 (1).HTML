</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners held lots that had been used an open storage for lumber since 1910. Fifty years later, an ordinance was passed prohibiting the open storage of lumber in residentially zoned areas. The landowners received notice to cease the open lumber storage on their lots, so they filed an application for a certificate of occupancy for the lots for the pre-existing nonconforming use. The application was denied, and the landowners sought review. The denial was affirmed by the board of adjustment, and the landowners challenged that decision, arguing that the zoning ordinance and its amortization provision were unconstitutional because they deprived the landowners of their vested properly rights without just compensation. The court found that the landowners had a vested right in the nonconforming use of their lots that could not be disregarded, that the amortization provision terminated the landowners right to continue their nonconforming use, and that the prohibition of the landowners' use as open lumber storage amounted to an unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial record had to affirmatively state that the constitutional issue was addressed by the trial court to present the issue of appeal. The court concluded that because the trial court's decision was unclear as to whether the trial court considered the constitutional issues, the court presumed that the constitutional issues were not addressed, and the court did not have jurisdiction over the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation operated a hotel in the city. The city notified the corporation of its liability to pay a tax of 2 percent of the gross daily rental receipts due from or paid by transient guests and that it was required to file the sworn statement referred to in St. Louis, Mo., Ordinance &sect; 29-108 and threatened to bring suit for the sum due unless the corporation complied. The corporation alleged that &sect; 29-108 was void on the ground that the subject was not clearly expressed in the title and that it did not fall uniformly upon the class. The trial court found the ordinance unconstitutional. In reversing, the court held that the title did not contravene the guiding principles of the St. Louis, Mo., City Charter art. IV, &sect; 13. Any person interested in the hotel or motel business would not be misled by the enactment of the statute under its title. Further, the ordinance applied to all hotels and motels alike. The court also determined and that there was no violation of the uniformity requirements of the state constitution and the city charter. The same rate was uniformly imposed upon all hotels and motels. No unreasonableness appeared on the face of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The foreign corporations filed motions to quash the attempted service of process and filed a writ of prohibition with the court. The court made a provision ruling and respondent trial judge file his return. The foreign corporations did not admit to doing or having done business in the state and the Secretary of State did not have any records in his office that showed that they had registered with his office. The court held that the attempted service was ineffective. The court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 351.630 did not require or direct the father or his counsel to furnish the foreign corporations' addresses to the Secretary and such act was gratuitous. The court further found that the &sect; 351.630 failed to provide a method which assured a reasonable probability of actual notice to the foreign corporations and thus failed to meet the requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 144.285 as amended in 1963 provided that on sales of less than 25 cents no tax shall be added. This was the same as the 1961 version of the law, but the preamble had been changed by omitting the phrase: &quot;Notwithstanding the rate of taxes imposed by this chapter.&quot; The State conceived great difficulty in implementing the tax as construed by the trial court because all but one plaintiff sold goods from its vending machines with prices that varied from as little as five cents to as much as 50 cents. In affirming the judgment that plaintiffs were not required to collect sales taxes on sales of less than 25 cents the court, en banc, rejected the State's contention that the 1963 amendment was intended to tax plaintiffs on their full gross receipts. In so holding the court acknowledged the administrative difficulty the law imposed upon the State in verifying that the receipts of sales tax from vending machine operators were correct, but noted that this was a matter to be addressed by the legislature, not the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents sought a declaratory judgment to determine the validity of rules promulgated by appellant Commissioner of Agriculture of Missouri under the Unfair Milk Sales Practices Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 416.410-416.560. They contended that the rules were arbitrary and beyond the Commissioner's authority. The rules required sellers to combine and average retail stops and routes in a given area to obtain a uniform cost to the milk processor or distributor for such area. Respondents attributed the reduction in their business to the pricing system introduced by the rules. Respondents followed the general practice of a graduated savings to their customers, depending upon the volume those customers purchased, to a certain reduction level in list price. The court held that the legislature did not intend to include volume pricing or quantity discounts as practiced by respondents within the competence of the rules. The court also held that the statute did not prohibit the widely used practice of quantity discounts by milk processors. It ordered an injunction against the enforcement of those rules.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found no error the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to quash as the substantive charge did not change in the substituted information. The court concluded that the trial court did not err in its evidentiary rulings or instructing the jury. However, the court determined that the trial court erred in applying &sect; 556.280 in sentencing defendant because the trial court failed to make a required finding that defendant served a sentence for his prior conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Claiming that the cemetery operated at a loss, the church sued the lot owners to abandon it, to remove the remains of those buried there, and to approve the sale of the property free of limitations on its use for cemetery purposes. The lot owners sought a declaration that the ordinance was void and an accounting of the fund. When the trial court authorized the abandonment and denied the lot owners' request, the lot owners appealed. Reversing the authorization, the court said that no situation justified the relief. The church did not justify the conclusion that the cemetery had been abandoned. The cemetery was maintained as such. The church obligated itself under perpetual care contracts representing more than 10 percent of the graves. That obligation was the source of the loss in maintaining the cemetery. The financial burden was not due to the lot owners' neglect, but was due to a contractual liability that the church had assumed. The court affirmed the denial of the lot owners' request. The ordinance was presumed to be constitutional. There was no basis to declare it otherwise. No basis for an accounting existed. No doubt was cast on the accuracy of the fund's audit report.</SPAN></P>

The Commission argued that the state was not prohibited from imposing its net income tax on the foreign corporation, and that the finding by the trial court to the contrary was unwarranted and against the weight of evidence. The foreign corporation claimed that &sect;&sect; 381-384 gave it complete income tax immunity and prohibited the state from imposing an income tax. On appeal, the court concluded that the admitted facts before it failed to show that the foreign corporation was engaged in intrastate commerce or that the foreign corporation's activities in the state equaled or exceeded the minimum standard set forth by &sect;&sect; 381-384. The court held that Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Movant was convicted under the Habitual Criminal Act for robbery in the first degree by means of a dangerous weapon. The case was tried under an information that was substituted for an indictment pursuant to Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 24.02, in order to supply a missing allegation concerning one of four prior felony convictions. After his direct appeal was unsuccessful, movant sought to vacate and set aside his conviction under Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26. The court affirmed a judgment overruling the motion without a hearing. Any issues of fact presented by the motion could be determined from the record and files in the original case, and there was no need for a hearing. The substituted information was not prejudicial because three other prior felony convictions were properly alleged in the original indictment, and the State was only required to prove one such conviction. The rule allowing substitution of the information was constitutional, and movant's claim that he did not receive effective assistance of counsel was not supported by the record. The court did not consider trial errors that were considered, or should have been presented, on movant's direct appeal form his conviction.</SPAN></P>

Reg. 15(f)(5) made under authority of Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 311.660(6). The suspension pertained to an allegation that the company offered a premium or prize as an inducement to purchase intoxicating liquor. The trial court found &sect; 311.660(6)&nbsp;unconstitutional as an unwarranted attempt to delegate legislative functions to the Supervisor. The trial court also declared that the regulation was invalid. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded with directions to reinstate the Supervisor's order. The authority of the Supervisor was only to make regulations that had a reasonable relation to the provisions of the Act. Mo.

XIV, and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, or the &quot;special law&quot; prohibition of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A Kansas City ordinance made it unlawful to engage in the business of servicing radio or television receivers without a license. It created a board to prepare examinations to test the qualifications of applicants for licenses, and made it easier for applicants with at least two years' experience to pass the examinations. In an action to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance brought by individuals who were engaged in the business affected by the ordinance, the court affirmed a judgment that the ordinance did not violate the federal and state due process clauses. As stated in its preamble, the ordinance was directed at preserving public safety and at the prevention of fraud on the public, which was particularly possible because of the complex nature of the machines involved. The advantage given to experienced servicemen, the failure to distinguish between outside servicemen and bench men, and the ordinance's failure to regulate all service dealers equally did not create unreasonable, arbitrary, or discriminatory classifications in violation of the equal protection of laws provisions of the federal and state constitutions, or the &quot;special law&quot; prohibition of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the opponents did not raise in their brief the contention that the zoning ordinance in question or any pertinent state statute was unconstitutional or invalid. The only references in the argument portion of the brief to the constitutional points were conclusory statements to the effect that the order of the Board deprived the opponents constitutional rights. No question was raised involving the construction of either the state or federal constitutions. Moreover, the court held that the record did not affirmatively show that at the time of the appeal there was in dispute an amount in excess of $ 15,000. There were statements that the denial of the application would do irreparable damage to the owners of the land and it valued the home from $ 15,000 to $ 90,000.

Defendant posed as the executrix of an estate to allegedly close and settle the estate. Defendant was found guilty and sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. Defendant filed a new trial motion that was denied. Defendant appealed, contending that &sect; 560.156 (2) was unconstitutional in that it was vague, indefinite, and uncertain. The court held that the circumstances in their totality did not constitute error sufficient for a reversal or a new trial. The court noted that deceit still occurred even though it occurred over a period of over a year. The simplified stealing statute, in the court's opinion, held that informations that described an offense and its conduct as theft by deceit was adequate, thus denial of defendant's bill of particulars was correct where the victim had relied on the false representation of defendant.

The court held as follows: 1) the terms of the Act to which the judge objected were generic words in common usage and having well defined meanings, as they described classes, orders, or kinds of merchandise; 2) the Act was sufficiently clear and definite to inform and warn a person of common intelligence of the kind of merchandise and commodities that could not lawfully be sold on Sunday and the claim that the Act was unconstitutional because of vagueness was without merit; and 3) the pleadings and proof did not disclose any injury or damage distinct and different than that suffered by other merchants and the public generally and this fell short of showing that the remedy at law was inadequate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Commissioner of Agriculture (Missouri) sought review of the dismissal by the Circuit Court of Laclede County (Missouri) of his petition and denial of his request for a permanent injunction against respondent dairy. The Commissioner argued that the dairy violated the Unfair Milk Sales Practices Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 416.440 (1959), by giving away milk with the intent of injuring a competitor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dairy gave coupons away to supermarket patrons over a period of three days that entitled them to a free carton of milk. The dairy claimed that the purpose was to introduce customers to its brand of products which had not previously been sold in the area. The commissioner argued the action violated &sect; 416.440 which prohibited giving away free milk. The court affirmed the dismissal and held that the commissioner did not prove the dairy's intent was to unfairly divert trade. The court held that the provision of the statute that provided that proof of giving away milk was prima facie evidence of a violation was a rule of evidence which could effect the burden of evidence but not the burden of proof. The court held the commissioner had the burden of proof to show the diary's intent, which it failed to do. The court found the evidence showed that the diary gave away milk in order to acquaint people with the brand in hopes that they would thereafter buy the product.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The collision occurred when a car crossed the center line and collided with the bus. The crash occurred on a bridge. The bus lights went out, the foot brakes failed, and the steering mechanism was damaged. The bus driver made no attempt to use the emergency brake. The expert testimony of a pathologist was admitted, and he stated that the driver of the car's ability to drive was seriously affected by alcohol. The passenger objected to the testimony because it was an unconstitutional search and seizure of evidence obtained by the unlawful and criminal desecration of a dead body. Upon review, the court found that the passenger had no standing to assert the constitutional question because there was no relationship between the passenger and the driver of the car. The evidence that the driver's faculties were impaired by the use of alcohol was admissible and bore directly on the issue of whether the bus driver was negligent. Under the evidence, the jury could have found that the bus driver was excused for not having resorted to the emergency brake because he was preoccupied with his attempts to keep the bus on the highway and to avoid going through the bridge railing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue on appeal was whether the trucking company's vehicles based in Tennessee, bearing Tennessee license tags, were permitted on interstate trips to pick up freight at one point in Missouri and deliver it to another point in Missouri; and whether its tractors, so based and bearing Tennessee license tags, were permitted to haul a trailer from one point in Missouri to another point in Missouri and then haul another trailer for the rest of the tractor's trip. The court did not see how language could be more plain or more definite to show that merchandise could not be carried between two points in Missouri regardless of whether the tractor or trailer, either or both, was on an interstate trip. The Fleet Proration Agreement designated a trip combining interstate and intrastate deliveries as an intrastate operation which was incidental to a trip of such vehicle involving interstate operation. Therefore, the court held that this kind of an operation, permitted by the Proration Agreement, was prohibited by the Multistate Agreement on a foreign license, regardless of whether or not the tractor or trailer, either or both, was on an interstate trip.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The air carrier operated in interstate commerce pursuant to federal authority. It was a Delaware corporation. The air carrier did not operate intrastate between any points in Missouri. The air carrier did make scheduled landings and takeoffs at one Missouri airport, where it also had a business office. The State Tax Commission of Missouri made an ad valorem assessment against the air carrier. Pursuant to a review of that assessment initiated by the air carrier, the trial court reversed the order and remanded the cause with directions to fix an assessment not in excess of a sum specified by the trial court. On appeal, the court concurred in the trial court's reversal of the Commission's order and in the trial court's conclusions that only those types of planes operated in Missouri in air commerce could be valued for purposes of the assessment. However, the court found that the trial court's ruling that the order of the Commission was violative of constitutional provisions because such rulings were unnecessary to the decision. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment was affirmed and the cause was remanded for the entry of a revised order of judgment.</SPAN></P>

The bank appealed, challenging the constitutionality of two sections of the probate code, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 472.020 and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 456.225. The sections granted jurisdiction to the probate courts over the administration of testamentary trusts and to set up the procedures. The bank argued the statutes conflicted with Mo. Const. art.

The court found that the supervision and control of testamentary trusts was not included in the matters contained in Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 16.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police officers noticed defendant ducking behind a car in a parking lot. The officers approached and ordered the occupants out of the car. The officers then observed a package containing marijuana on the floor of the car, which defendant claimed was his. Defendant was arrested and charged with illegal possession or control of marijuana. After a jury trial, defendant was convicted and was sentenced as a habitual criminal. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court ruled that defendant's extrajudicial confession was admissible because the corpus delicti of the crime was sufficiently proved by his constructive possession of the marijuana. The court held that the evidence of defendant's constructive possession of the marijuana was sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict. The court ruled that defendant could not challenge the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.180 (1959), which relieved the state of any burden of negating any exception, excuse or exemption to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 195.010-195.210 (1959), because he did not preserve the issue for appeal. The court also held that the information charging unlawful possession or control disjunctively was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

Section 167.020 contained no express provision that no person should be voted for whose name did not appear upon the printed ballot. Mo. Const. art.

III, &sect; 40(30).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 563.721 (1963) prohibited the selling at retail of certain commodities on Sunday. The retailers, who made retail sales on Sunday of practically all of the commodities covered by the prohibition of &sect; 563.721, sued for a declaratory judgment that the section was unconstitutional and unenforceable, and for an injunction barring its enforcement. The court affirmed a trial court judgment that the section was valid. The fact that archaic laws prohibiting virtually every kind of work on Sunday other than household work were repealed when &sect; 563.721 was enacted did not show that the section created a discriminatory classification of prohibited activity in violation of the due process and equal protection provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 10. Section 563.721 was a modern replacement that the state legislature had discretion to enact to provide for the health and welfare of the people. Nor did the retailers demonstrate that the legislature unreasonably or arbitrarily failed to include activities or commodities similarly situated to those covered by &sect; 563.721. Accordingly, it was not a special law prohibited by Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30).</SPAN></P>

The employee was awarded a worker's compensation claim. The employee later moved to dismiss the claim because the city was not self-insured. The Commission vacated the award and dismissed the claim and the employee sued at common law. Nine years earlier, the Commission had notified municipalities that the law was unconstitutional and their status as a self-insurer was cancelled. The Commission later stated that the opinion was erroneous but that any city wishing to be reinstated had to file a new surety bond. The city failed to do so. The city argued that coverage could be cancelled only through formal action of record. The court held that under the Commission's rules if a self-insurer failed to maintain security, its self-insurance authority would terminate without notice and hearing. The city contended that the Commission acted in excess of its powers when it entered the order vacating the award. The court held that while the power to take actions of this nature was not conferred specifically by statute, such power was to be implied from the nature of the Commission's functions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney general brought an action against the owner for operating a nursing home without a license. The trial court issued a temporary restraining order and then granted a permanent injunction in favor of the attorney general. After the owner's motion for a new trial was overruled, she appealed. She claimed that she was not engaged in an operation which required a license. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that there were two separate categories which were included within the definition of nursing, convalescent, or boarding home under &sect;198.011 (1957). The Division of Health also issued minimum standards under &sect;198.072 (1959) for the operation of professional nursing homes, practical nursing homes, and domiciliary homes. The court found that the owner's operation fell into the second category and met the definition of a domiciliary home. The owner provided more than simply room and board to persons. If that was not the case, there would have been no occasion for a licensed practical nurse to have been employed, and there would have been no need to have commodes, bedpans, hospital beds, and bedrails on the premises.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners alleged that the growth and development of the region outside the city to the west, southwest, and northwest was so great and had so completely changed conditions in the area that rezoning of the 10 acres from residential to commercial was necessary for the physical and economic needs of the area. They argued that the city's refusal to rezone was arbitrary and unreasonable. The trial court found that the landowners made a prima facie case as to the nature and needs of the entire community, but they failed to establish that those needs were not in conflict with the social, economic and physical conditions within the city. The court held that there was sufficient evidence, including zoning and other maps, contracts, plan of proposed shopping center, and other documents, to prove that the issue of whether the 10-acre tract should be rezoned was fairly debated. The court held that a change of conditions in the city which required such a change in the landowners' property was not shown but it was reasonably shown that there were available nearby larger commercially zoned areas to make such changes if needed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the action that denied the landowners' request to have their 10 acres of land rezoned for commercial purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The highway commission sought to condemn certain property. Suit was filed, and a deposit was made in the trial court. The owners subsequently withdrew a certain amount, and the highway commission took possession of the property. The highway commission alleged that it was entitled to judgment interest on the funds held in the registry. The trial court found that the interest statute,&nbsp;&sect; 523.045, was unconstitutional and that the owners were not required to pay interest on the funds held by the clerk. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that although the trial court erred by finding &sect; 523.045&nbsp;unconstitutional, the correct result was met. The court noted that the highway commission was not required to take possession of the land before obtaining a final adjudication of the owner's damages. The legal obligation of the highway commission to deposit in court the amount of the commissioners' award as a condition precedent to taking possession of the land was clear and independent of &sect; 523.045. The court concluded that because the fund was in the custody of the law and could not be paid out without an order of the court, it did not bear interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners wanted to build an addition to a building they owned in a residential district. The addition was to be used as a slaughterhouse. The city officials denied the landowners' request for a building permit. The denial was based on the landowners' failure to comply with an ordinance that required them to obtain the consent of three-fourths of the residents in the district where the land was located, and on an ordinance that made it a misdemeanor to operate a slaughterhouse within the city limits. In the trial court the landowners argued that the ordinances were void because they were beyond the city's power to enact, and the city officials argued that the ordinances were valid exercises of the city's police powers. The city officials' motion for a new trial contained a general allegation that the ordinances were constitutional. The court held that under Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3, it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal because neither the pleadings nor the trial court's judgment mentioned the constitutionality of the ordinances and no question of the construction of the U.S. Constitution or the Missouri Constitution was presented.</SPAN></P>

The board claimed that ordinance changes by referendum were prohibited by the county charter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Certain areas of the county where the landowners lived were zoned as residential property, but 225 acres purchased by the company were rezoned as a heavy industrial district and granted a special use permit for use as a quarry. The landowners made a petition to place repeal of the rezoning on the ballot, and the board refused to place their proposed ordinance on the ballot. The trial court then ordered it placed on the ballot. On review, the court found that St. Louis County, Missouri, Charter, art. VII, &sect; 77, art. III, &sect; 18(5), expressly excluded the use of a referendum procedure to amend the county zoning ordinance because such power was specifically reserved to the planning commission and county council. The court ruled that any purported enactment of an amendment to the comprehensive zoning ordinance without compliance with the county's charter would be unlawful and void. The court reversed and remanded the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an earlier opinion, the court reversed an order dismissing the city's petition for annexation. The trial court had dismissed the petition on the theory that the areas of St. Louis County lying outside of cities, towns, and villages were not &quot;unincorporated area&quot; within the meaning of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.015 and thus were not subject to annexation under that Act. In the earlier order, the court found that the Act applied to the proposed annexation. On remand for a trial on the merits, the trial court authorized the annexation. On appeal, the court reversed and dismissed the city's petition, holding that the city had not met its burden of proving the elements required by the Act. The county was able to furnish all normal municipal services to the area, except fire protection, which was available elsewhere. Thus, the annexation simply imposed city taxes upon the residents and property owners of the area without the equivalent in added benefits. Therefore, the proposed annexation was not reasonable to the residents and property owners of the area sought to be annexed, and the interests of the county as a community outweighed the claims of the city.</SPAN></P>

The village contended that it had authority to zone and restrict private schools, and that its ordinance, Village of Town and Country, Mo., Ordinance No. 50, art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 2(3) permitted only public schools within residential districts, and the village sought to prohibit the location of a private school, operated for profit, within a residential district. The school owners contended that private and public schools could not be distinguished, and that an ordinance restricting private schools bore no relation to public safety or general welfare. The school was established before the enactment of the ordinance. There was no information as to the exact location, nature or extent of the buildings in which the school was conducted. In short, there were no surrounding circumstances to accompany the stipulated facts. The fact that the school was operated for profit was not a determinative factor, but was considered relevant. The only issue was whether the &quot;permitted use&quot; of public schools legally prohibited the location of a private school, operated for profit, in a residential district. In the limited circumstances of the record, the court found that there was an insufficient relation in the stipulated facts and the general welfare, and as applied to this school, the ordinance was arbitrary and unreasonable, and therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also denied the owners' motions to dismiss and for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trustees of the city adopted a zoning ordinance that placed all of the territory of the city into one, single-family residential district. The owners later bought a 15-room house in the city that was planned and built for occupancy by two families or as two units. After the owners began renting the separate units to different families, the city filed suit to enjoin them from violating the zoning ordinance. The trial court issued a permanent injunction, giving the owners 120 day in which to comply. On appeal, the court held that the city had no authority to adopt the zoning ordinance and the ordinance was invalid because, although the Missouri zoning enabling act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 89.010-89.140 (1949), permitted the consideration of the character of a district and of its suitability for particular uses, the act as a whole did not give a municipality the power to adopt a one-use district zoning ordinance encompassing the whole town. The court further found that, even if the whole city was suitable for one-family residences at the time the ordinance was enacted, the city's suitability in the future, in whole or in part, for other uses was not adequately considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife's petition averred that her husband, while a passenger in an automobile, was negligently injured by the transit company and as a result she was deprived of his consortium. The trial court granted the transit company's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the wife could not recover for loss of consortium caused by the negligence of a third party. On appeal, the wife argued that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the transit company. Upon review, the court agreed with the wife. The all-pervading and overwhelming fact was that the concept of the inferior status of the wife was totally repudiated and for the court to perpetuate the erroneous denial of a right of a wife based upon that repudiated early common-law concept on the ground that if that manifest wrong was to have been righted, it must have been so done by the legislature, would have been an improper avoidance of the court's judicial function. Decisions founded upon the assumption of a bygone inequality were unrelated to present realities, and should not have been permitted to prescribe a rule of life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grant of summary judgment to the transit company was reversed, and the case was remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An Illinois resident, for himself and other similarly situated, brought an action against the Missouri Collector of Revenue for the City of St. Louis to find that St. Louis, Mo., Ordinance No. 47063, which imposed a city income tax against him because he worked in St. Louis, was unconstitutional and invalid. The trial court found that the ordinance was reasonable, constitutional, and valid. The trial court found that the resident's allegations in his pleadings did not entitle him to relief and dismissed the resident's action. The court affirmed. The court held that nonresident individuals could be subjected to a state tax on income earned within the state. The court reasoned that the St. Louis earnings tax was not a tax imposed for the privilege of the taxpayer to engage in or practice the particular business or profession, not a tax upon the privilege of entering and working in the city, and not a property tax. The court concluded that the mere incidence of the factors that the resident paid taxes to Illinois and its political subdivision did not demonstrate that the earnings tax was an undue or improper burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question before the court was whether Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 351.630(2) (Supp. 1961), which went into effect after the incident giving rise to the cause of action against the corporation, was prospective in its application and substantive in character or whether it was to be applied retroactively. The court concluded that &sect; 351.630(2), as amended by 1961 Mo. Pub. Laws 257, evidenced a clear intention on the part of the legislature that the statute was to operate prospectively only. The court found that the statute expressly said: if a foreign corporation commits a tort. The court concluded that the statement pointed to a happening in the future. The court concluded that to hold otherwise would have made the section unconstitutional and void because it would have changed the legal effect of past actions and would have imposed new duties and attached new disabilities in respect to transactions or considerations already past.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The deputy clerk was appointed by the circuit clerk and her annual salary was fixed by the circuit judge. The county court, however, approved and budgeted a lesser amount for the salary, and the monthly warrants issued for the deputy's salary were in the lesser amount. The judges contended that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 483.345, authorizing the appointment of deputies by the circuit clerk, was unconstitutional because it violated Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7, and also violated Mo. Const. art. II by allowing the judicial department to usurp the functions of the executive or administrative branch of government. The court affirmed the judgment. It held that there could be no conflict between &sect; 483.345 and art. VI, &sect; 7 unless the statute was invalid for some other reason. The court held that the judges' constitutional point had not been preserved for review because they failed to assert the point in their motion for a new trial. The court also held that the order of the circuit judge made pursuant to Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had argued to the trial court that the city's appeal should be dismissed because the ordinance and the statute on which it was based were unconstitutional. The trial court agreed that the statute on which the ordinance was based, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.750 (1959), had no substantial or rational relation to the police powers of the State and not only regulated the hours of labor but also the opening and closing times of shops. The trial court concluded that &sect; 71.750 was unconstitutional. The court held that it could not decide the issues briefed by the parties on the record before it because the ordinance had not been introduced into evidence. Although courts could take judicial notice of statutes, they could not take judicial notice of municipal ordinances. Without the ordinance, the court did not know its terms or if it was intended to be based on &sect; 71.750. The trial court had no way of knowing that either because the ordinance was not in evidence.

Issuance of the bonds was authorized pursuant to Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 23(a) and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 71.790-71.850 (1959)</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">All steps requisite to issuance of the bonds were taken.

Const. art. VI, &sect; 27, and the Auditor argued that the amendment was therefore void because it submitted two amendments as one. Mo. Const. art. &sect; 23(a) authorized the issuance of general obligation bonds, and Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 27 authorized the issuance of revenue bonds. The court found that the subject of the amendment was the authorization of municipal financing of manufacturing and industrial development projects, by the issuance of bonds, and that this reasonably included provisions authorizing the issuance of different types of bonds. The court rejected a similar attack on the enabling legislation, and further rejected, inter alia, an attack on the amendment because the ballot title under which it was submitted did not observe the 25-word limitation contained in Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board adopted a detailed resolution to acquire a site and erect an office building for the use of the various State departments and that revenue bonds were required to pay for the venture. The taxpayers argued that issuance of revenue bonds for such a purpose constituted a liability of the State in contravention of Mo.

The taxpayers also alleged that the issuance of the bonds constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The court determined that the issuance of bonds did not constitute a liability as used in &sect; 37. The court further concluded that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8.370-8.450 did not amount to an improper delegation of legislative powers in violation of the constitutional mandate for separation of powers. The court modified the Board's resolution because the proceeds of the sale of the bonds was state &quot;money&quot; and subject to Mo. Const. art. 3, &sect; 36. Thus, the court determined that it should have been placed in the state treasury when realized and appropriated to the Board for its use in the construction of the building and attendant expenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator former state employees brought a proceeding in mandamus from a circuit court (Missouri), in which the court granted an alternative writ. The employees were members of respondent Missouri State Employees' Retirement System. The employees requested payment of annuities on an increased basis effective October 13, 1961, pursuant to an amendment to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 104.310-104.600 (1959), which was refused by the retirement system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees had not made contributions since retirement. The employees asserted that the legislature intended to include the annuities of retired members in providing for the increase and that the enactment, as thus construed, violated no constitutional provisions. In denying the permanent writ, the court held that the amendment constituted an impairment of the contract in violation of Mo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13 as to all members not retired on October 13, 1961, and who had since continued to contribute because the amendment, applying as it purported to do to all &quot;members,&quot; would necessarily take a portion of the existing fund to pay the increases to retired members. The court found that those who had retired had a vested right in the continuance of their respective annuities under the law as it existed at the time of their respective retirements, active members had certain vested interests, and the legislature could alter, amend, or repeal the law, but only subject to the rights existing at that time. The court concluded that the increase so provided by the amendment was unenforceable and void as to those members who retired prior to October 13, 1961.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court discharged the alternative writ and denied the employees' application for the permanent writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two men robbed a confectionery. Defendant was arrested and identified by the victims as one of the robbers. The court upheld defendant's conviction and sentence. The court rejected defendant's argument that Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 556.280, which provided sentencing guidelines for individuals who had previously been convicted of a felony, violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 23. Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 556.280 did not embody more than one subject and did not contain subjects that were not clearly expressed in its title. All the provisions of &sect; 556.280 had a natural relationship with the subject of the act, which was the trial and punishment of persons convicted of crimes after they had been convicted of other felonies. Police records were properly admitted into evidence because they were not hearsay and were adequately identified by a qualified witness, even though the witness had not prepared the records. The trial court's decision to limit defendant's counsel's argument regarding defendant's willingness to take a lie detector test was proper because lie detector test results were inadmissible, and the decision did not prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant union sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which, along with a permanent injunction, was entered in favor of respondent State of Missouri pursuant to the King-Thompson Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 295 (1959). The injunction restrained the union from continuing, inciting, supporting and participating in the work stoppage, refusal to work, and strike against the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The union challenged the King-Thompson Act as unconstitutional. The Act allowed the State to exercise, in an emergency situation, its police power to take over and maintain the operation of the public transportation system when the public interest, health, and welfare of the State was jeopardized by a sudden interruption and discontinuance due to a strike by the employees of the transportation company against their employer. When the union went on strike against the employer, the State was granted an injunction under the Act. The court pointed out that the employer, the transportation company, was not a party to the action and that the trial court's injunction only forbade the union from striking against the State. Therefore, the court noted that the union's argument that the Act was in conflict with federal labor laws was not directed to the trial court's judgment. The court also noted that the Act did not deny the union's right to engage in a peaceful strike against the employer and that the union could seek a modification to the trial court's decree when the emergency situation declared by the state long longer existed. The court therefore rejected the union's challenges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the trial court's judgment so that the trial court retained jurisdiction of the cause to modify its decree in accordance with changing facts and conditions. As so modified, the court affirmed and remanded the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 195.020 and 195.200 (1959). Defendant was then sentenced to nine years of imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that his sentence constituted cruel, unusual, and inhuman punishment and violated the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He contended that he was actually imprisoned for being afflicted with a disease and that by enacting Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 202.360 (1959), the legislature recognized that narcotic addiction was a disease by making provisions for the involuntary confinement of drug addicts in state hospitals for insane persons for treatment until such habit was cured. The court held that the portion of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.020 that made the &quot;status&quot; of addiction an offense was unconstitutional and void. A state law that imprisoned an addict as a criminal inflicted a cruel and unusual punishment. However, the remainder of the statute was not declared invalid because it was not inseparably connected with or dependent upon the invalid part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a city, the attorney general, and the state auditor, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Christian County (Missouri), which declared subdivision 2 of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48.030 (1959) unconstitutional in accordance with the contention of plaintiff county treasurer that the county had changed from a fourth class to a third class county, a contention that affected the treasurer's salary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county was a fourth class county. The auditor informed the county that its valuation showed an increase in the number of people, changing it from fourth class to third class, but the enactment of subdivision 2 of &sect; 48.030 (1959) required that such a change be submitted to the voters. The issue was submitted and the voters voted against it. The treasurer filed a declaratory action contending that because the county qualified as a third class county, he was entitled to the salary provided for that level. The circuit court found subdivision 2 of &sect; 48.030 (1959) unconstitutional and that the treasurer was entitled to back salary. The county, auditor, and attorney general appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that subdivision 2 added a variable that disrupted the common denominator of the classes in that it added the element that no county could become a different class until the move was approved by the voters. This perverted the entire scheme of classification and in effect created an additional class of counties, in violation of Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 8. As such, subdivision 2 was unconstitutional and the treasurer was entitled to a ruling in his favor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The salesman became a door-to-door solicitor of periodicals and was compensated on a commission basis. Orders were processed through the home office in Ohio. The salesman was arrested and convicted by the village's chairman's court of having violated its ordinance requiring a license before such sales could be solicited. He appealed, challenging the validity of the ordinance on grounds that it violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, empowering Congress to regulate commerce among the several states. The circuit court affirmed the conviction and the salesman appealed. The court reversed the decision. The court found based on prior case law that solicitation of the orders constituted interstate commerce, as the economic effects on interstate commerce in door-to-door soliciting could not gainsaid. Further, the salesman had timely raised the issue of unconstitutionality as the record showed that as soon as the village had closed its evidence in chief at the chairman's court trial, the salesman had orally challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance and made a motion for dismissal at the close of all evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporate interstate common carrier of oil and gas had a private pipeline easement along a portion of a proposed highway right of way. The commission filed a petition to condemn a substitute easement over the landowners' property. The trial court granted the landowners' motion to strike and dismissed the commission's cause of action for the appropriation of an easement. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the use of the substitute location was for an authorized public use. It was for the improvement of the highway. The surrender of a portion of the existing private right of way easement involved factors closely connected with the safety and welfare of the traveling public, and the commission could not compel the common carrier to surrender its easement without making some provision for it. The commission found the appropriation necessary for the proper and economical construction and maintenance of the highway. The appropriation of the easement for the benefit of the common carrier thus did not violate Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 38(a), 39(2). A grant of public money to a private corporation was not established.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company contended that the present order, in requiring service beyond its voluntary undertaking and profession of service, was a taking of its property without due process. It also contended that the order was based upon incorrect or unsupported findings of fact, or upon evidentiary matters not included in the record before the Commission. The Commission argued for the desirability of rural telephone service to areas unable to support a modern telephone system and consequently for the power and authority of the Commission to compel the service. The court held that the order was not based upon or supported by competent and substantial evidence. In neither the finding of facts nor in the order was there any substantial evidence concerning the financial resources of the company or of its ability to initially finance the project. Further, there was no evidence that a loan had been applied for or if sought that it would or should be approved.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the provisions of &sect; 165.833 were wholly foreign to the title and subject matter of the act in which the section had been placed and that the authority relied upon to support the proposed conveyance was not within the purview of the title of the act and germane thereto. The court held that the subject matter of &sect; 165.833 was not clearly expressed in the title of the act and the section was unconstitutional and void.

The court held that: (1) the municipal ordinance, designed to prevent discrimination by reason of race or color in restaurants, bore a substantial and reasonable relation to the specific grant of power to regulate restaurants and to the health, comfort, safety, convenience, and welfare of the inhabitants of the city and was fairly referable to the police power of the municipal corporation; and (2) it had not been demonstrated that the ordinance was an arbitrary or unreasonable exercise of the police power of the city; hence, the ordinance was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that suits against corporations were commenced either in the county where the cause of action accrued, or in any county where such corporation shall have or usually keep an office or agent for the transaction of their usual and customary business. The court held that the resident's cause of action, if he had any, had accrued in the City of St. Louis and that statutory venue laid only in said city, unless venue might have also laid in St. Louis County by virtue of Mo.

The court affirmed the judgment and ordered that the sentence be executed. The court found that there was no merit to defendant's contention that &sect; 334.030 was invalid for the reason that the term &quot;practice of medicine&quot; was not given a legislative definition. The information fully advised defendant of the acts contended by the State of Missouri to constitute the practice of medicine. The evidence established that the conduct of defendant did constitute the practice of medicine in the generally accepted and understood meaning of that term, which &sect; 334.030 proscribed and declared to constitute a misdemeanor unless done by one duly licensed as provided by law or excused from obtaining a license.

Ordinance No. 288 that purported to levy an annual license tax on drive-in theaters were unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted Ordinance No. 288, which levied an annual license tax on drive-in theaters. The corporations commenced a declaratory judgment action against the city, seeking a declaration that the portion of the ordinance that levied taxes on the drive-in theaters was unconstitutional. The trial court dismissed the action and the corporations appealed. The court held that because the city was not a charter city, its authority for levying taxes had to be found in the statutes. Mo. Rev. Code &sect; 94.270 (1959) provided that &quot;moving picture shows&quot; were among the businesses upon which license taxes might be levied. It was difficult to justify a distinction between moving picture shows held indoors and moving picture shows held outdoors. When the city taxed on the indoor theaters at a flat rate and the drive-in theaters at a graduated rate, the result was that the drive-in theaters were taxed 17 to 30 times greater than the indoor theaters. The city could be justified in subclassifying movie theaters for licensing purposes, but it could not unjustly discriminate, in the amount of the tax imposed, between the subdivisions.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that (1) insofar as the petition attempted to state an action against respondents in their official capacities, the action was one against the state; (2) the taxpayer was not entitled to judicial review of the decision of the director of revenue because that decision was subject to administrative review under Mo.

Stat. &sect; 138.430; (3) the state only consented to be sued for the recovery of illegally collected taxes under the statutory procedures and had otherwise not waived its sovereign immunity; and (4) the taxpayer failed to state a claim against respondents in their individual capacities because the money collected had long since been paid into the state treasury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, in the business of selling milk products in Missouri, moved the court for an order declaring the Unfair Milk Sales Practices Act (Act), Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4416.410-416.560 (1959), which prohibited the sale of milk below cost, as unconstitutional and enjoined defendants from enforcing it. Plaintiffs prevailed. Defendants appealed. Court rejected plaintiffs' arguments and reversed. The Act was not a special discriminatory legislation in violation of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 or 10, or art. III, &sect; 40(30), or of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Challenged provisions of the Act were not arbitrary, unreasonable or so vague as to be impossible of reasonable and fair administration. The provisions were a proper exercise of the state's police powers. The Act was not preempted by federal antitrust laws, as its purpose was not to regulate interstate commerce, but to regulate sales of milk products within Missouri.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An owner employed defendant, a real estate agent, to sell a parcel of his land. Defendant placed a sign on the parcel publicly advertising it as being for sale. Because the sign did not indicate the use zoning district in which the parcel was situated, defendant was convicted and fined for violating the Ordinance. The court upheld defendant's conviction because the Ordinance did not violate defendant's constitutional rights of due process and free speech but was reasonable and not oppressive. The court held that the City of St. Louis, Mo., Charter art. I, &sect; 1(25) and (33), gave the City authority to regulate brokers under its police power. The court held that the Ordinance was not class legislation because it applied to all persons dealing in the sale of real estate as brokers and its requirement that the permissive use for which the property was zoned be indicated on for sale signs was intended to promote the convenience and welfare of the City's inhabitants. The court held that the Ordinance did not suppress the business of brokers or declare it to be a nuisance but was a valid regulation that business.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Missouri Conservation Commission was the entity responsible for issuing hunting and fishing licenses. A service fee was charged, in addition to the license charge, for each permit issued. The clerk was appointed as the distributing agent for the Commission. He contended that he could retain the service fee as his own for issuing the licenses. The county contended that Missouri's Constitution, the St. Louis County Home Rule Charter, and St. Louis County Ordinances prohibited the clerk from receiving any compensation in addition to his salary. Specifically, Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 12 (1945) prohibited county officers from receiving additional fees for their services. The court held that the prohibitions only applied to compensation received by the clerk in performing his duties as the county clerk. It did not apply to additional duties he assumed. In issuing the licenses, the clerk was the agent of the Commission, performing a service in another and distinct department than that of county clerk. As such, he was not prohibited from receiving additional compensation. The Commission could compensate the clerk, as its distributing agent, through the service fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 3 of the city's zoning ordinance gave the board of aldermen the authority to permit the establishment of off-street parking space within residential districts, not more than 125 feet from any commercial district, and contiguous thereto, by special permit, but only when such requirements of improving, maintaining, operating, and screening of the parking space were imposed as would protect the character of the surrounding development. No such special permit could be granted until after a public hearing and after a report has been submitted by the city's zoning commission. The applicant received a special parking permit pursuant to this section of the zoning ordinance. The court affirmed the circuit court's decision. Section 3 of the city's zoning ordinance did not constitute an unwarranted delegation of legislative discretion to an administrative board without sufficient standards, in violation of Mo. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. Section 3 imposed two immutable requirements. If these were met, the board of aldermen was then entitled to consider and rule upon the application, granting it if it found that the stated protections would be adequate under the existing circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Appellants contended that the trial court erred by enjoining the enforcement of the ordinance because it was a valid exercise of the council's police power to promote the public health. The court reversed, holding that the county ordinance was not unconstitutional because there was substantial evidence in the records from which the county council could have concluded that dental decay was a widespread and serious disease affecting the dental health of the county's residents and the fluoridation of the county's water was a reasonable and practicable public health measure. The ordinance did not violate &sect; 10 because it was enacted for the protection and enhancement of the public health and general welfare of the county's residents. The ordinance did not violate Mo.

Members of a meat cutters' union had gone into defendant's store on a Sunday and purchased a frying pan, a card table, decks of playing cards, and ballpoint pens with refills. Appeal was taken on the ground that the Missouri Sunday laws were unconstitutional. The court held that the Missouri Sunday laws were civil and not religious regulations. The court also held that the Missouri Sunday laws were based on sound public policy, which recognized that rest on one out of seven days was for the general good of mankind. The court further held that reversible error occurred on voir dire when the prosecutor asked, over defendant's objections, improper questions that attempted to commit jurors before they had heard evidence, instructions of the court, or argument of counsel. Finally, based on a finding that the prosecutor's actions constituted reversible error, the court deferred ruling on defendant's claim that the trial court erred in permitting the state's witnesses to testify that they had no need for the articles that they purchased.</SPAN></P>

After the commissioners filed a report, a judgment was entered by the trial court that affirmed the compensation award. On appeal, the property owner claimed that the trial court erred in determining the amount of the award as of the effective date of the ordinance authorizing the condemnation. That date was December 5, 1945. The property owner contended that the trial court, on the hearing of the exceptions, should have determined the damages as of the date the city deposited in the registry of the court the amount found to be due by the commissioners. That date was March 1, 1956. The court agreed with the property owner and reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the actual taking of the property of the property owner in this case occurred on March 1, 1956, when the amount of the award was paid into the registry of the court and not on December 5, 1945, the date the ordinance became effective.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury of second degree burglary and of stealing. Because the jury also found that defendant had been convicted of four prior felonies, his punishment was assessed at ten years' confinement for the burglary and five years for the stealing. Defendant was well represented at his trial by two competent, court-appointed counsel. Upon appeal the judgment and sentence were affirmed. Defendant filed in the trial court, pro se, his motion to vacate the sentence and judgment. The trial court held a hearing and had defendant brought from his confinement to the court for that purpose; it again appointed counsel to represent him at the hearing. Defendant offered no evidence, but the matter was argued and the proceedings were transcribed. The motion was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court gave defendant the benefit of any and all doubt in holding a hearing, that the jury necessarily imposed the maximum punishment applicable to the subsequent offenses, and that nothing was done in the habitual criminal procedure which afforded defendant a remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police officer purchased two copies of a magazine from a newsstand where more than 2,000 magazines were offered for sale. Defendant was employed as a clerk at the newsstand. There was no evidence that defendant had anything to do with the purchase or selection of magazines that were offered for sale, or that he had any knowledge of the contents of the magazine in question. Defendant argued that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 563.280 (1949) impaired his rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and the First Amendment and Due Process and Privileges and Immunities Clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The court held that &sect; 563.280 was unconstitutional because it imposed strict criminal liability without requiring any element of scienter or knowledge by defendant of the contents of the magazine. The court rejected the State's argument that defendant had acted with reckless disregard for the consequences of his act and that the court could infer the necessary intent from his recklessness because proof of scienter could not render valid a statute that was void for failing to require scienter as a constituent element of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city issued bonds to improve its sewerage system, including bonds to acquire rights-of-way. The city filed an action seeking authorization to adjudicate the validity of the bonds. The individuals intervened seeking to have the bonds declared unconstitutional. The circuit court authorized use of the bonds as general obligations of the city payable from ad valorem taxes. The individuals sought a new trial, which motion was overruled. They appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that because any deficiencies in the procedures provided for levying the special assessments could not have been contemplated by city ordinances, &sect; 95.125 was not unconstitutional as being in violation of the due process of law provisions of the constitutions. The proposition was not in the nature of a double propositions submitted in an effort to attract the votes of all electors because the inclusion of information that the city would be reimbursed from special assessments did not have the effect of combining two separate and distinct propositions into a single submission; hence, the proposition was not the submission of unrelated matters and was not misleading or in fraud of the voters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The shop owners filed suit alleging that a license tax imposed on operators of a barber and beauty shop was unconstitutional and that the ordinance was invalid because of its classification and because the enabling statute,&nbsp;Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 94.110, was broad and vague. The trial court found that the ordinance was not unreasonable, discriminatory, or oppressive and entered a judgment to the effect that stated the ordinance was valid. The shop owners appealed. First, the court held that the shop owners were not entitled to notice of any proceeding to adopt or enact the ordinance. Second, the court held that the ordinance was not discriminatory simply because certain businesses were excluded from the classification. There was no constitutional objection to the classification scheme because the amount of the tax was not fixed so high that it would be virtually confiscatory or prohibitive as to some of the vocations or businesses listed therein. Third, the court held that the license tax was equally applied to all of the people within the &quot;class.&quot; Lastly, &sect; 94.110 was not broad because it authorized the city to collect license tax upon more than 200 vocation.</SPAN></P>

After conviction in Circuit Court, defendant appealed to the Kansas City Court of Appeals which transferred the case to the court on motion of defendants because constitutional questions were involved. The court held that it had jurisdiction over the appeal because the constitutionality of the municipal ordinance under the federal and state constitutions was involved. The court further held that defendants had not waived the constitutional question because the record of the Circuit Court asserted that the constitutional question was raised, kept alive, and briefed by the parties. In addition, the court held that the statement of defendants' counsel purporting to waive the constitutional issue did not preclude the Circuit Court from considering the question because the unconstitutionality of an ordinance or statute on which the prosecution was based could not be waived.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers argued that the sale constituted an unconstitutional use of public power and public funds in aid of a private sectarian school controlled by a religious denomination, and that the sale constituted an unconstitutional taking of private and public property for private use and an abuse of the power of eminent domain. They also claimed that the sale was not made at fair value because the value fixed by the authority was not in accordance with a standard authorized by law, and that the vacation of a certain public plaza in the tract conveyed to the university by ordinance of the city constituted a direct, illegal, and unconstitutional contribution of public lands to the university. The taxpayers argued that the university was treated as a &quot;public body&quot; under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 99, although it was in fact a private sectarian school controlled by a religious denomination. The court found that the trial court properly found against the taxpayers on the essential fact issues as to illegal designation and that its findings were not clearly erroneous, but instead were properly based on credibility of witnesses and were supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

The assessor admitted that the removal of more than one million dollars worth of timber should have had an effect on the assessment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Use Tax Law substantially and adversely affected the railroad corporations. The corporations in interstate commerce purchased vast quantities of materials and supplies from vendors outside the State of Missouri for use and consumption or storage by the corporations within Missouri. The corporations sought to have the Use Tax Law declared unconstitutional. The lower court declared the Use Tax Law void and the Director sought review. On appeal, the court overturned the judgment and remanded. The court did declare Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.615(8), (9), and (10), which were exemptions from the use tax, to be invalid. The court held that the exemption of these items from the use tax was not based on differences reasonably related to the purposes of the law, discriminated against similar property purchased locally for the same purposes, and thereby created an unreasonable, arbitrary and discriminatory classification in violation of Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 3.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school district sought to obtain the landowners' property as a location for a school and abandoned the condemnation within the allowable 10-day period under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 523.040, 523.050, 523.060 following the jury's assessment of the condemnation award, which was a higher amount than what the school district initially sought to pay the landowners. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The school district, as a public entity, was not liable for the landowners' litigation expenses or pecuniary loss because the condemnation action was filed in performance of its public duty and it abandoned the proceeding in good faith within the time allowed under state law. Condemnation law recognized the right of abandonment by the school district if the jury's assessment was so high as to make acquisition of the property prohibitive. Mo. R. Civ. P. 86.06 supported the conclusion that the school district abandoned the condemnation in good faith because Rule 86.06 limited the reinstitution of an abandoned condemnation against a given property to at least two years after abandonment of the previous action.</SPAN></P>

As a habitual criminal, defendant was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. On appeal, defendant contended that his right to be present during the entire criminal proceeding was violated and that the second offender statute, Mo. Rev.

The court ruled that the absence of defendant in the proceedings before the court in chambers when the evidence of his prior convictions was presented was inconsequential and did not prejudice defendant. The court noted that defendant was present for a portion of these proceedings and was represented by counsel in the proceedings at all times. The court also ruled that Mo. Rev.

Defendant was identified by several people involved in the transaction where he tried to sell the stolen auto.

Further, the court held that assessment of the punishment by the trial judge of defendant, found guilty as an habitual criminal under a charge of committing the felony on trial prior to the effective date of the statute, was not a proceeding under a statute retrospective in its operation and amounting to an ex post facto law, it did not deprive defendant of due process of law or of equal protection of the law and did not deprive him if any constitutional right to have a jury pass on his prior conviction and punishment.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff retail merchants, engaged in the purchase and sale of commodities or tangible personal property, argued there was no reasonable basis for the classification that disqualified them from obtaining licenses to sell checks or money orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs were excluded from obtaining licenses for the sale and issue of checks, drafts, and money orders for a fee, pursuant to Mo.

The statute permitted licensing if the purchase and sale of commodities did not constitute the major portion of the business, which the court found was arbitrary. The court affirmed the finding that the statute was unconstitutional and held that it was arbitrary discrimination and violated the Equal Protection Clause to make exclusions not based on differences reasonably related to the purposes of the statute. The stated purpose for the exclusion was to exclude those businesses that might have been prone to use funds received in check or money order writing to finance their operations. The court found that the reasons for the exclusion did not actually provide the protection stated.

Stat. &sect; 556.280, the evidence affecting the punishment was to be adduced before the jury, and the jury was to assess the punishment. In this case, the trial court excused the jury and heard the evidence and assessed punishment itself. Appellant did not object until after punishment was assessed. Affirming, the court held that appellant's objection after the jury was excused and all the evidence came in without objection failed to preserve any error for review. The court held that 1959 Mo. Laws S.B. 117, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.280, was a procedural statute. Appellant acquired no right under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1.160 to insist that his case be disposed of under the prior &sect; 556.280. The 30-year imprisonment assessed against him was less than the maximum required under prior Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.280. The amended statute did not require the assessment of the maximum punishment for the offense on trial. Under exception (2) of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1.160, the amended statute controlled; it was not an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which found defendant guilty of robbery in the first degree and sentenced defendant as a habitual offender pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.280 (1959). Defendant argued that he should not have been cross-examined as to his former convictions under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.260 (1949) and that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.280 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that the trial court erred when it permitted the State to file an amended information, in which defendant was charged with the prior felony convictions, on the day of trial. According to defendant, the amended information constituted a new charge and defendant should have been accorded another preliminary hearing and granted time to meet the new charge. The court stated when defendant failed to object and proceeded to trial, he waived review of this issue. Contrary to defendant's contention, it was well settled that when a defendant elected to testify in his own behalf, he could be cross-examined with respect to former convictions upon the issue as to his credibility as a witness, and that was true notwithstanding the provision in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 546.260 which limited the cross-examination of a defendant to matters referred to in his examination in chief. The court also ruled that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.280 was not unconstitutional because of the provision that the trial court shall assess the punishment. Additionally, &sect; 556.280 was not unconstitutional because of any denial of due process or equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

The claimant and his friend testified to facts that showed beyond doubt that they were guilty of trespass in violation of a city ordinance and also of &sect; 560.315, V.A.M.S. The watchman was not only justified in making the arrest, but the arrest was clearly within his duty as a watchman. There was no evidence to support an assault claim.

The trial court set aside the revocation on the ground that Mo. Rev.

Const. art. V, &sect; 22. The commissioner appealed. The court held that art. V, &sect; 22 did not prescribe a method of review. The method and procedure had been provided by &sect; 536.070 which placed the burden on the licensee to have such evidence recorded. The licensee was so notified and did not choose to do so.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents, the directors of a public water supply district, appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which ruled in favor of relator bondholder and issued a preemptory writ of mandamus compelling the directors to deposit sufficient funds to pay the principal and interest due on general obligation bonds issued by the district and held by the bondholder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The directors argued that the water district had been relieved of a proportionate share of its liability on the bonds because a part of the district, annexed by an adjoining city, had been detached from the district pursuant to a court decree under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 247.160 (1949). Following the annexation, the district had sold the property and equipment in the annexed area to the city in exchange for, inter alia, the city's promise to make installment payments as necessary to liquidate its portion of the bonds. The court on appeal held that the agreement between the district and the city did not have the legal effect of relieving the district of its primary obligation to pay the whole amount of the principal and interest on the bonds. The court found that, while &sect; 247.160 authorized the district's sale of its property and equipment to the city, it did not expressly or by implication relieve or release the district from its obligation to the bondholder. Absent statutory authority, the court held that the contract of sale and court approval of such sale could not release the district. The court concluded that mandamus was a proper remedy to compel the district to pay the bondholder.</SPAN></P>

The verdict and judgment from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) was for the motorist. The passenger prosecuted an appeal that challenged an instruction given on behalf of the motorist and an evidentiary ruling of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passenger was an occupant of a car that was being driven by her husband when it collided at an intersection with the motorist's vehicle. The passenger questioned the motorist's sole cause instruction on the grounds that it misdirected the jury by reason of the use of the word &quot;approach&quot; instead of the word &quot;enter&quot; in regard to her husband's proximity to the intersection. The evidence indicated that the husband and the motorist were each approaching and for all practical purposes entering the intersection. The trial court considered the instruction not prejudicially erroneous when it overruled the passenger's motion for new trial. The case was a simple one that involved easily understood issues of primary negligence within the common knowledge of jurors. The court approved the trial court's ruling. Also it was not necessary for the sole cause instruction to inform the jury that the negligence of the husband was not to be imputed to the passenger. Finally, the trial court was not required to receive in evidence from the passenger an unauthorized publication of or a copy of a purported traffic ordinance that was not properly identified and adequately offered. No error was found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that the ordinances were invalid because they, inter alia, unlawfully delegated legislative power to the Parking Meter Commission and authorized the transfer of parking meter funds to the general revenue for further traffic regulation, including off-street parking facilities.

Although the ordinance providing for parking meter installation was invalid as an unlawful delegation of legislative power to an administrative tribunal without adequate standards, as a practical matter, it was impossible to refund the funds accumulated under it to the thousands of parking meter users. Further, the trial court erred in determining that the ordinance authorizing the transfer of parking meter funds to the general fund was invalid because there was nothing improper about using the excess revenues to finance traffic regulation, including off-street parking facilities.</SPAN></P>

The state, therefore, sought to remove the corporations' right to operate business in the state. The court granted the ouster, but stayed the ouster upon condition of the payment of fines by the corporations. The court found that there was sufficient evidence showing the corporation's violation of the motor vehicle registration laws, specifically Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 301.020, and willful abuse of the franchises granted to them by the state. The court rejected the corporation's argument that it was entitled to reciprocity on the issue of registration, because the privilege of reciprocity was limited to the respective states of the corporations' incorporation. The court also rejected the corporations' argument that the motor vehicle tax imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce. The tax was imposed on every owner whose motor vehicle operated in the state and the funds went to the maintenance and construction of highways in the state.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that it did not have jurisdiction of the appeal. The Commission granted the MPSC authority to construct and operate an electric plant or system to furnish electric service. Subsequently, all the rights and franchises of the MPSC were transferred to the Company. The transfer was approved by the Commission. The Company acquired rights of way by purchase or condemnation to construct a transmission line to make a connection with a main line. Appellants, complainants before the Commission, were landowners affected by the construction of the line. The court stated that the jurisdiction of the Commission was fixed by statute. Since the validity of that statute was not attacked, the case could be properly determined by a construction of the statute for the purpose of determining whether or not the Commission exceeded its statutory authority. The Court of Appeals had authority to construe the statute for that purpose. Therefore, the case had to be transferred to the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff railroad appealed the judgment from the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri), which affirmed the order of defendant Public Service Commission of Missouri upon defendant city's complaint that the railroad's bridge was deteriorated, run-down, dangerous, and inadequate. The Commission ordered the railroad to construct a new concrete and steel bridge, the city to pay one-third of construction costs and thereafter maintain the bridge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1922 the railroad gave an improvement company a revocable license to build and maintain a bridge over its tracks. In 1932 the county accepted the bridge as a county structure. The city was incorporated in 1950. The railroad argued that the Commission's order was void because the bridge was a private crossing or that the order violated due process. Affirming the judgment, the court found that neither the county nor the city had to condemn the right of way because the bridge was expressly dedicated to the county and later by its incorporation to the city. The court noted that the city was not a party to the 1922 contract or the agreement between the railroad and the county and that the county did not agree to be bound by the contract between the improvement company and the railroad when it accepted the bridge. The court held that the Commission had jurisdiction under Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 386.640 over the construction, relocation, or reconstruction of bridges over railroads and that it could require the railroad, without violating its constitutional rights, to reconstruct a crossing or to bear or contribute to the expense thereof, where such action was not arbitrary or unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which upheld the Commission's order that the railroad build a new bridge and that the city share the cost of construction and maintain the new bridge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation and its president contended that they did not receive personal notice through the mail of the Board's action dramatically increasing their merchant's tax valuation, as required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 150.060 (Supp. 1957), and consequently were not afforded an opportunity to appear and at the subsequent session of the Board to contest the increase. The trial court admitted, over objection, a copy of a letter extrinsic to the record of the Board that purported to be the required notice; the letter was relied upon by the trial court in its finding in favor of the Board. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and ordered that the record of the Board's proceeding be quashed. It held that the Board was a tribunal of limited jurisdiction; that its jurisdiction must appear on the fact of its proceedings; and that because notice was jurisdictional, the failure of the proceedings to show the necessary jurisdictional fact of notice rendered the proceeding void. The court further held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.105 was not intended to be applicable in providing a review by stated statutory actions, including certiorari, of a decision of a local board of equalization.</SPAN></P>

The trial court set aside the findings of the Commission and remanded the cause to the Commission. Both the proponents and the opponents of the Prevailing Wage Act, Mo.

The trial court entered a default judgment in favor of plaintiff. Plaintiff then instituted garnishment proceedings against defendant insurer, who insured the owner. The insurer filed a motion to quash the garnishment, which was granted. Plaintiff sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 506.200-506.320. The summons was sent to the owner at his last known address, but it was returned marked &quot;unclaimed.&quot; The insurer argued that the underlying judgment was void because the trial court had no jurisdiction over the owner in that there had been no valid service of process. The insurer also argued that insofar as &sect;&sect; 506.200-506.320 provided that service of process on non-resident motorists could be accomplished by merely mailing the papers to the owner's last known address, regardless of whether the papers were actually received, &sect;&sect; 506.200-506.320 violated due process. The court held that: (1) to give a trial court jurisdiction to proceed against a non-resident defendant, the return receipt had to either be signed by the addressee or accompanied by a statement from the postal authorities that the addressee had refused to sign for the papers; (2) if unable to accomplish either option, plaintiff had to proceed with personal service; and (3) Williams v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The garbage company and the city entered into a fixed-price, 10-year, garbage-hauling contract. When the contract became economically infeasible for the company, the company persuaded the city to amend the contract to provide for a higher rate for the hauling. In affirming the judgment the court held that the ordinance that authorized the amendment and the amendment itself ran afoul of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 39(3), which prohibited the general assembly from authorizing any county or municipal authority to grant any extra compensation, fee, or allowance to a public contractor after service had been rendered or a contract had been entered into and performed in whole or in part. The court rejected the company's contentions that the amendment was made for the city's benefit and that the company gave additional consideration for the amendment. The court noted that the amendment simply had the effect of paying the company more for what it already had improvidently agreed to do. The court also held that the taxpayers were not guilty of laches in waiting four years after the amendment to file the action.</SPAN></P>

Defendant offered to sell the &quot;old&quot; outboard motor to the officer. The officer saw that the motor still had a tag on it and arrested defendant. The motor's owner testified that the brand new motor was stolen from his vehicle the night before. Defendant testified that he got the motor from a man who offered to give him a commission if defendant sold it. The court held that the trial court had properly overruled defendant's motion to suppress because the motor was in plain view and discovered without a search. Furthermore, defendant gave the officer permission to look at the motor. The evidence was sufficient to connect defendant with the stealing of the motor. It was in his truck and he exercised dominion over it when he tried to sell it. The State made a submissible case and the trial court properly overruled defendant's motion for a directed verdict. The verdict was sufficient to convict defendant under the habitual criminal statutes because he had admitted to his prior convictions during his testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed an action against the principal and the surety to recover on an appearance bond in a criminal case where the principal failed to appear. The trial court issued a writ of scire facias which was served on defendants. The surety filed a response and a motion attacking the petition for failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a claim upon which relief could have been granted, which was denied. The trial court granted the State judgment. On appeal, defendant contended that at the time of the execution and filing of the recognizance, any prosecution of the principal was barred by the three-year statute of limitations, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 541.200 (1949), and that he was unlawfully held in custody over objection at that time. Therefore, the recognizance was null and void. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, the writ of scire facias was quashed, and the surety discharged. The court concluded that no indictment or information had been filed within three years after the alleged offenses charged in the affidavit were committed and that prosecution was barred by the statute of limitations when the recognizance was executed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant issued a check to the county tax collector for payment of real and personal property taxes assessed against him. The collector noticed that the check was post-dated and was returned for insufficient funds. Defendant invoked the appellate jurisdiction of the court because he was challenging the constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;561.460 on the ground that the statute permitted imprisonment for debt, that he was denied due process of law, and that he was placed in double jeopardy. However, the court reviewed defendant's brief and found not the slightest reference to the alleged constitutional questions in the jurisdictional statement. The court held that raising a constitutional question was not a matter of form and stressed that the constitutional question must actually exist. The mere assertion that defendant had been denied due process was insufficient. Because defendant was only guilty of a misdemeanor that did not involve the construction of the constitution of the United States or the State of Missouri, the court transferred the matter to the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation petitioned the trial court to determine whether it was liable to pay a sales or use tax under the provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.440 (Cum. Supp. 1957). The corporation was the parent company of three Delaware corporations which were merged into the parent. After the merger, the corporation applied for certificates of title and registration in its name on motor vehicles previously registered in the names of the merged corporations. The director of revenue refused until a sales or use tax was paid. The trial court found for the corporation. The director appealed. The parties agreed that Delaware law governed the effect of the merger on the transfer of titles. The court affirmed. The tax on the sale of the motor vehicles was paid when they were purchased. Their acquisition by merger was a transaction not covered by &sect;144.440. There was no sale and no &quot;purchase price&quot; as specified in &sect; 144.440. Tax laws must be strictly construed against the taxing authority. The court ordered the director to issue the certificates of title and registrations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed. As there was no purchase price or sale contract involved in the acquisition of the motor vehicles by plaintiff through the merger of three corporations there was not a taxable transfer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a mandamus proceeding, relators, the members of the Board of Police Commissioners of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, sought to compel respondents, city officials and administrative boards, to appropriate and pay additional funds for the police department's 1959 expenses. Respondents argued that the St. Louis (Missouri) Police Act, Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect;&sect; 84.010-84.340 (1949, Cum. Supp. 1957), barred certain expenses and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city reduced the Board's estimate of funds necessary to run the police department in 1959 before appropriating the funds and accordingly later rejected many of the department's claims for salaries and other expenses. Relators sought to compel payment. Respondents contested claims for matrons, prison guards, and school crossing guards, on the ground that they were police personnel unauthorized by the Act, and argued that the Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the Act was not unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative power or of the power to tax. Respondents could contest only unpaid claims. As the Act specifically provided for department maximums, prison guards and matrons, who were essentially police personnel, could not lawfully be employed as &quot;clerks and subordinates&quot; under Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 84.190 (1949, Cum. Supp. 1957). As the state could not tax for local functions, school crossing guards, who performed a local function, could not lawfully be employed as additional policemen. Undenied allegations that the city refused to pay certified claims for supplies, equipment, contractual services were deemed admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court issued a peremptory writ against respondents and their successors in office for the funds sought for supplies, equipment, and contractual services and for civilian salaries exclusive of those for police guards, matrons performing police duties, and school crossing guards.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A country treasurer and ex-officio admitted that he had retained certain disputed fees and commissions and also admitted that such monies were in excess of the sums allowed under law. The ex-officio argued that the statutes which limited the total fees and commissions of county treasurers who were ex-officio collectors, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52.260, 52:270, were unconstitutional. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court rejected the ex-officio's argument that the legislature was deceived as to the subject matter of the relevant statutes. The court found that the trial court erred in holding that the ex-officio was not liable for the principal sums due because the State had accepted payments as final settlements. The court emphasized that while settlements between public officers and other official bodies authorized to audit and pass upon accounts could be prima evidence of the matters stated, they were not conclusive and did not bar the recovery of excess commissions due the state. The court further rejected the ex-officio's argument that limiting his commissions deprived him of property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tax commission sent a letter to the county that stated that the average assessment of real property in the county was 27.2 percent and that the minimum should be 30 percent. The county increased the assessment of 200 to 250 pieces of property, out of 180,000 in the county, including the taxpayers' buildings, which were assessed at 50 percent of fair market value. The new assessments were upheld by the county board of equalization and the tax commission, but the trial court set them aside and ordered the tax commission to enter specific assessments based on the trial court's findings. On further appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the assessments were discriminatory and not supported by competent and substantial evidence because the county assessor testified that the taxpayers' buildings were assessed at approximately 50 percent of their current market values while other real estate was assessed at materially lower percentages. However, the court held that the trial court did not have authority to set the new assessments and could only remand to the tax commission with instructions to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A highway construction plan caused the water company's pipelines to become covered by pavement. The Commission ordered the water company to relocate its pipelines. The water company was given a hearing before the Commission, but it was not the kind of hearing required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.070 for contested cases. The water company sought judicial review in the circuit court, and the Commission sought prohibition to prevent the circuit court from proceeding. The court concluded that the circuit court had jurisdiction. The Commission's prior authorization of the pipelines in that location amounted to a license, and the relocation order was a modification or revocation of that license; therefore, the issue was a contested case under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.010. The relocation decision was an adjudication of facts amounting to a quasi-judicial decision within the meaning of Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 22. The water company was not given the kind of proceeding to which it was entitled under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536. On rehearing, the court held that the authorization of judicial review of administrative decisions determining legal duties or privileges, provided by &sect; 536, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Using the statutory remedies, the taxpayer obtained a reduction of a real estate tax assessment and filed a petition for review of a decision of the State Tax Commission. The taxpayer chose not to use the statutory remedies to challenge an assessment in a subsequent taxable year but filed an equity action alleging that the assessment was unconstitutional because it was made by carrying forward the assessment from the prior year. The court held that the trial court properly dismissed the action against the Assessor and Collector because the taxpayer did not exhaust the remedies available under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 138.180, .430(2), and .470(4); Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.100 (1949); and Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 22. The court held that the taxpayer could not resort to a court of equity for relief on the ground of preventing a multiplicity of suits before a final decision on appeal was rendered in the statutory remedial proceeding. Without a final decision, even limited application of res judicata was not available to the taxpayer. The court held that allowing the equitable action would have delayed and frustrated the orderly statutory procedures for taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen alleged that candidates on the nonpartisan or independent primary ticket were entitled to the same nominating procedures as permitted for partisan candidates for City office. The court held that the trial court erred in granting the citizen declaratory relief. The court held that the provisions of the election law applicable to the City, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 122.650-122.970 (1949), as applied to the citizen, did not violate his rights to equal protection and freedom of the vote under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 or 25, or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that it was reasonable to require plaintiff, in order to become a candidate on a nonpartisan or independent ticket, to be nominated by a petition or certificate signed by a certain number of electors and to require only a declaration and fee to become a nominee of a political party. The court held that limiting the size of the ballot to potential independent or nonpartisan candidates who demonstrated measurable voter support constituted a reasonable basis for treating partisan and nonpartisan candidates differently in nomination procedures.</SPAN></P>

The deceased was the driver of the car in which the passengers were riding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passengers were riding in the deceased's car, and the driver and three friends were in his. The driver was on the highway, and the deceased and the passengers were on a intersecting east-west road. The trial court entered a verdict in favor of the passengers. On appeal, the administrator withdrew his appeal and sought affirmance of the verdict. The court attempted to determine whether, under all the facts and circumstances as revealed by the evidence, the driver was negligent in any of the respects charged by the passengers, and if so, whether that negligence contributed in whole or part to cause the injuries to the passengers. The court noted that the issue of liability in the case was not to be confused with the issue of submissibility. The court held that there was no evidence produced that proved that the driver negligently operated his car. He had a car that was in good working order, and he was familiar with the road. There was a stop sign at the intersection, and the evidence tended to show that the deceased failed to stop at the intersection. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city enacted certain zoning ordinances, and the church was refused a permit to build a temple on its property, which was located in a residential district. The church filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that those ordinances were void and asking that the city be enjoined from enforcing those ordinances against the church and from interfering with the use of its property for constructing a building to use for religious purposes. The trial court entered a decree for the church and granted the relief sought. The city appealed, but the court affirmed the decree. The ordinances at issue were void, insofar as they required a special permit for the location of schools, which was also true as to churches. In view of the usual and customary location of churches in residence districts and the strong constitutional provisions for freedom of religious worship, the court did not think that the legislature had any intention of authorizing the exclusion of either churches or schools from residence districts. There was no such authority given to municipalities by Missouri's zoning act, so the ordinances at issue were invalid as applied to both churches and schools.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant sought certain zoning approval from the zoning board. The property owners claimed at a public meeting that they would be adversely affected by the requested use. At a subsequent meeting, the board approved the proposed use. Some 70 days after the approval, the property owners filed a petition in the trial court seeking judicial review of the decision. They claimed they were told they would be given notice of any board action, but were not. The applicant and the board filed motions to dismiss because the petition was not filed within 30 days of the board's decision as required by law. The trial court ruled against the property owners on the merits. The intermediate appellate court ruled that there was no basis for the trial court's decision on the merits, but that the petition should have been dismissed because it was not timely filed. The property owners challenged the constitutionality of the time requirement. The case was transferred to the instant court. The court ruled that even though the property owners were not given notice of the subsequent meeting, their action was time-barred.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs contested an assessment of tracts of land by the city equalization board. The valuation was undertaken as part of a citywide reassessment of industrial property with land and improvements being assessed separately. The board did not reduce the valuations.

The circuit court reversed the Commission, holding that plaintiffs had been subject to a heavier tax burden than other taxpayers in the city. Defendants and intervenors appealed. The court held that various boards of equalization are empowered with original jurisdiction to accomplish intracounty equalization and that the Commission had exclusive jurisdiction to effect intercounty equalization. The court held that because plaintiffs conceded their tracts were assessed at less than their true value and were on an equal and comparable value with all other real estate located in the city that no relief would be granted.

The original case against relator was commenced on the theory that it was a proceeding for review of a &quot;contested case&quot; under the Administrative Procedure Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.105. Relator's jurisdiction in this case depended upon whether or not the original claim was a &quot;contested case&quot; as defined under the Act. The court defined contested case as a proceeding before an agency in which legal rights, duties or privileges were required by law to be determined after a hearing. The court determined the problem with the original action was that the parties could not point to any law, which required a hearing on their claim before relator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The questions presented were whether the remainder of the trust was contingent or vested at the death of the testator, whether one of the children was a lineal descendant of the testator, and whether the action of one of the heirs in contesting the precluded his children from sharing in the distribution of the trust assets. The court held that testator obviously intended that at the termination of the trust, the assets should have vested in his lineal descendants surviving at the time and divided per stirpes. Because none of the persons who hoped to share these trust assets as &quot;lineal descendants&quot; had any vested right thereto until the trust terminated, their contingent remainder did not come within the protection of the due process prohibitions of U.S. Const. amend XIV, &sect; 1 or Mo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13. As for the enforceability of the no-contest provisions of the will, the court reaffirmed previous caselaw holding such provision enforceable and recognized that a forfeiture clause was to be strictly construed and the provision of the testator's will applied to the contestant's descendants as well as the contestant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff democratic voters appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which granted a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted by defendants, the Democratic City Central Committee of Independence and its individual members, in the voters' action seeking a declaratory judgment relating to the manner of conducting primary elections in the City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the election in question, voters selected both their primary candidates for an election and elected defendants. The basic issue in the case was whether this combined primary and election was subject to the constitutional and statutory provisions governing elections or only those provisions dealing with primaries. The voters' petition sought a judgment declaring that the City's primary elections were subject to Mo. Const. of 1945, art. I, &sect; 25; Mo. Const. of 1945, art. I, &sect; 10; and certain statutes such as Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 111.530, which stated that voting booths would be provided in polling places and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 111.370, which stated that polls would remain open certain hours. The court found that Mo. Const. of 1945, art. I, &sect; 10 really did not apply to this question and that the general protections afforded by Mo. Const. of 1945, art. I, &sect; 25, had been implemented by statutes that specified in detail the manner of conducting elections. The question at issue was a question of law, and the answer was not dependent upon the construction of a constitutional provision, so the court did not have exclusive jurisdiction as provided for under Mo. Const. of 1945, art. V, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

In affirming defendant's conviction, the court found that the elements of malice and premeditation could be inferred from the circumstances. Defendant hit the victim in the head with a bat and then shot her twice. The remoteness of the prior conviction did not affect the admissibility of evidence of the prior conviction because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 556.280 did not contain a maximum time limit within which the prior conviction shall have occurred. Mo. Const. art. I did not guarantee the secrecy of judgments in criminal cases and such records were required to be made available to the public. Defendant and the victim's daughter both stated that they were not legally married, even though they lived together for 11 years, so she was a competent witness in the action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant union officials sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which enjoined them from continuing and participating in a work stoppage and strike against a gas company or plaintiff State of Missouri. The judgment also declared that the King-Thompson Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 295 (1949), upon which the action was based, was valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The governor had proclaimed that the public interest, health, and welfare were jeopardized as a result of the interruption of gas service caused by a strike of the gas company's employees. Executive orders were issued, the property of the utility was seized, and when the employees returned to work, the State sought and obtained an injunction. On appeal, the court noted that there were reports of gas escaping into the sewer systems and causing gas fires which had to be extinguished. While the evidence was not sufficient to show that defendants were responsible for the acts of sabotage which helped bring on the emergency, it was sufficient to prove that there was a serious interruption of utility service and the public interest, health and safety were jeopardized. Thus, the award of injunctive relief was proper as it grounded in protecting that public interest. Moreover, the King-Thompson Act did not abolish the right of utility employees to strike, but only subordinated the right to the public interest. In affirming, the court noted that it was confining its decision regarding the constitutionality of the King-Thompson Act to the provisions discussed in its opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the judgment under review to the constitutionality of certain named sections of the King-Thompson Act, and as so modified, the court affirmed the judgment against defendants.</SPAN></P>

She filed an amended complaint alleging petitioners' residences, the deaths of the owner and driver, and the appointment of administrators, and praying for an order of service on petitioners as nonresidents that used the highways of Missouri as provided by &sect; 506.210. On special appearances, after their motion to quash the return of service was overruled, petitioners filed a petition for a writ of prohibition contending that the trial court had no jurisdiction to proceed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The School District had alleged that its right to establish and maintain public schools was derived from Mo. Const. of 1945, art. IX, &sect; 1(a) and that any judgment for the Fire District would be in violation thereof. The Fire District claimed that the court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal under Mo. Const. of 1945, art. V, &sect; 3 because the School District's claim required construction of a constitutional provision. The court found it had no jurisdiction. Caselaw held that the contention that a statute would conflict with a constitutional provision if construed in a certain way did not vest the court with appellate jurisdiction. The legislature had implemented Mo. Const. of 1945, art. IX, &sect; 1(a) by enacting Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 165 (1949) pertaining to the establishment of school districts. Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 321 authorized the establishment of fire protection districts. These two chapters set forth the authority and duties of the parties. There was no claim that the statutory authority of either or that the ordinances of the Fire District were unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants drove vehicles that had Iowa tags and that were maintained at and operated from the employer's terminal in Iowa. Defendants argued that they were entitled to operate in Missouri with Iowa licenses under the terms of a reciprocity agreement between Missouri and Iowa that concerned reciprocal motor vehicle taxes and fee exemptions. On appeal the court found that it lacked jurisdiction over the cases because the record did not present a question of a violation of U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 or Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, provisions against the impairment of obligations of contracts. The constitutional provisions did not apply to Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 301.270 because the statute was enacted prior to the reciprocity agreement. The appellate jurisdiction of the court in criminal cases was governed by the grade of the offense and not by indirect and incidental determinations as to compliance with revenue laws that were the subject of the crime. Under &sect; 301.270, the conviction or acquittal of defendants did not directly affect the right of the state to collect revenues, prohibit the state from collecting revenues, or directly enforce the payment of any revenue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties, both residents of Kansas, were involved in a traffic accident in Johnson County, Kansas. Plaintiff commenced a personal injury action in Jackson County, Missouri. The trial court sustained defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of forum non conveniens. Plaintiff appealed from that judgment. On appeal, the court noted that plaintiff had complied with the general venue statutes,&nbsp;Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect;&sect; 507.020, 508.010 (1949). Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 also declared that Missouri's courts were open to every person. Nevertheless, those provisions did not require Missouri's courts to submit to an abuse of their process by nonresidents and did not prohibit the plea of forum non conveniens. However, the court stated that doctrine should be applied only upon a clear showing of inconvenience and when the ends of justice required it. Furthermore, in a transitory action, the plaintiff was, in general, entitled to select the forum. Therefore, because Johnson County was immediately contiguous to Jackson County and was only separated by the state line, a finding of inconvenience was not supportable and the trial court erred when it found to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, in issue was whether the validity of the order of the Commission increasing valuations in St. Louis County, might properly be considered in the action. The court determined that it might not. Equalization between counties was a duty expressly imposed upon the Commission by the mandate of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 138.390. The order of the Commission did not constitute a &quot;contested case&quot; within the meaning of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.100 providing for judicial review of administrative decisions in such matters. In matters thus reviewable under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536, notice to the parties affected was expressly provided for in &sect; 536.090, and the petition for review was required to be filed within 30 days after the mailing or delivery of notice. The order here affected counties and classes of taxpayers, and not &quot;specific parties,&quot; and it was not a subject of contest, within the usual understanding of that term. The court held that the equalization order was not a decision of which a review was contemplated under &sect; 536.100.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the section of the ordinance was unconstitutional. Reversing, the court held that the procedure prescribed by the section was sufficient to provide against the exercise of arbitrary and uncontrolled discretion by the city council. The court stated that the section required the city council to determine whether the location and use of a filling station in a commercial area would promote the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the community through considering whether such location or use would adversely affect the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, public utility facilities, and other matters pertaining to the general welfare. Moreover, the court stated, such a determination was to be made upon evidence adduced before the city council and required the council to thereafter exercise its discretion based upon its findings. Therefore, the court concluded, the legislative discretion delegated to the city council was sufficiently circumscribed so as to require that the discretion be reasonably and not arbitrary exercised.</SPAN></P>

The owners' land was not part of the city when they filed a subdivision plat for their subdivision that did not reference the disputed right of way. Later, the city extended its limits to include the owners' land, and they filed an amended plat showing the right of way. The Commission's petition alleged that the amended plat constituted a dedication that extinguished the owners' right of access, but it also sought to condemn the right of way and the right of access. The court affirmed the judgment. The amended plat was not a dedication, and when the petition was filed an easement of access belonged to the owners which was condemned and extinguished by the proceeding. A motion for a directed verdict filed by the Commission was properly overruled because there was sufficient substantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably have found that the owners were damaged. The court held that in the absence of statutory authority, the trial court had no power to add interest to the amount of the verdict and that it did not err in revoking its order that had allowed interest on the verdict.</SPAN></P>

The tract was part of an 86-acre parcel in the center of the city that was occupied by a widow who was granted a life estate in the property by her late husband. The condemnation proceeding was opposed by the widow, the decedent's executors and family, and the city. The city's local zoning ordinance did not allow the school to be placed in an area of residential estates. The school district challenged the ordinance on the grounds that it deprived the school district of its condemnation power. On review of the matter, the court held that the zoning ordinance was not a valid restraint on the school district's power. The court found that the city could not prevent the placement or regulate the location of a school within its borders by means of zoning restrictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dealer claimed that the city's ordinance was in conflict with the Liquor Control Act, Mo. Ann. Stat. ch. 311 (1949) and the Nonintoxicating Beer Law, Mo. Ann. Stat. ch. 312 (1949) and violated the Missouri Constitution. The trial court agreed. The court held that there was no conflict between the provisions of Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 311.070, as supplemented by the supervisor of liquor control's Regulation 1(g), and the provisions of the ordinance. The fact that Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 311.070 prohibited a wholesaler from selling only to certain retailers did not mean necessarily that it granted a privilege or license to wholesalers to sell to all retailers who were not within the specific prohibition of &sect; 311.070. The prohibition contained in the ordinance was only an enlargement of the same type of prohibition contained in the Act. Therefore, the ordinance and the Act could coexist in harmony. The dealer failed to meet his burden of showing the unreasonableness of the ordinance. The fact that the enforcement of the ordinance could cause pecuniary loss to the dealer did not tend to make it unconstitutional or otherwise invalid.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that the information was an attempt to prosecute defendant for a violation of two separate criminal statutes in one prosecution, since the information charged defendant with two different felonies; that, in attempting to charge defendant with the offense of molesting a minor, the information failed to charge any offense under the law; and that the statute, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 563.160 (1949), was broader than the title and, for that reason, unconstitutional. The title of the act was as follows: An Act making it unlawful for any person to annoy or molest, detain or divert any minor and providing a penalty therefor. The court held that the title was broader than the Act, that it was broad enough and did include the offense charged against defendant, and that the provisions of the Act were sufficiently indicated by and were within the title.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment and a decree in favor of the city and required the bus company to pay a remaining balance to the city. The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's judgment that required the bus company to pay the city, but did not rule on the validity of &sect; 12. The court held that the bus company, by its acts and conduct over a period of many years, had placed itself in a position where it was estopped from attacking the validity of &sect; 12. The court noted that the bus company, for more than 25 years, had applied for and received the issuance and transfer of valuable permits from the city under which the bus company had operated all of its bus routes. The court found that the bus company had received a valuable special privilege that was the equivalent of a franchise.

Defendant argued that Section 19 did not give equal rights and opportunities to the citizens of different counties in the state, and denied equal protection to certain citizens. The court disagreed, noting that being a U.S. citizen did not confer the right to fish in the streams and artificial lakes of Missouri. Furthermore, the regulating of fishing was permissible if based on some reasonable ground or on some difference that bore a just relation to the attempted classification.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The land claimant sought title to land passed by a will under the estate administrator. The land claimant filed a complaint seeking title to the land, and a lien against the estate for sums spent on reliance of the land claimant's ownership of the land. After the action had been continued more than once, counsel for the land claimant sought to be entered. When counsel could not certify that they were ready for trial, the trial court refused to grant the motion to enter the appearance and dismissed the complaint on its own motion. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the land claimant had a right to be represented by counsel. The court further held that the requirement that the counsel adhere to the existing trial schedule was an imposition of an unreasonable restriction upon counsel. The court concluded that the denial of the dismissal of the complaint before the trial court had entertained and considered a potential motion for a further continuance was a denial of due process, as guaranteed by Mo.

The court ruled that the father had not waived his challenge to the constitutionality of the Act even though he waited until the mother's offer of evidence to raise that issue. Under the Act, there was no requirement that a defendant file an answer or any other pleading. On the merits of the father's appeal, the court ruled that the Act did not violate the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, para. 3. Per the court, no agreement or compact was entered into by Missouri via the Act. The court also rejected the argument that the Act unconstitutionally imposed a retroactive obligation. The Act did not impose a duty on the father to support his minor child; that duty came from state law that existed before the Act. The court also rejected the contention that the Act violated due process required by the U.S. Const. and the Mo. Const.; albeit he had not been given notice of the Virginia proceeding, the Virginia court's findings were just recommendations in Missouri.

Defendant's conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal. There was no double jeopardy issue based on the charge of three prior convictions in defendant's information; the prior convictions were relevant on the issue of punishment and did not constitute separate charges. Evidence of firearms was properly admitted because the firearms were sufficiently connected with the crime charged; the firearms were found in an area in which defendant was hiding and one was identified as the firearm that defendant carried during the crime. A police officer's testimony was properly admitted to impeach defendant's wife's alibi testimony. Though the trial court refused to allow defendant additional time to obtain a rebuttal witness's presence, defendant had ample additional time in which to secure her presence. The jury instruction was properly limited to first degree robbery because the evidence was sufficient to establish defendant's guilt of the offense; it was not necessary to submit an instruction on a lesser offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City was experiencing rapid population growth and began to experience parking problems, due to lack of available metered parking spaces on the street. The City then proposed a bond issue for an off-street parking facility that would be totally financed from revenues of the parking system. Respondent, a concerned taxpaying citizen, opposed the bond issue, contending that the issue was invalid. The City filed a petition with the trial court, seeking a pro forma decree authorizing the issuance of the bonds and declaring the validity of the bonds. The concerned citizen filed an intervening petition contesting the validity of the bonds. The trial court entered a decree declaring that the proposed bond issue was invalid. The court reversed and remanded, holding that a municipality had the power to issue revenue bonds payable solely out of net revenues derived from the operation of a parking system. The City Council had authority to exercise the power granted it, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.360 (1955), in any reasonable and proper manner, where specific methods or details were not provided.</SPAN></P>

The appeal was referred to a commissioner for an opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The widow's husband had been a policeman, who was injured when he was struck by automobile while he was on-duty. Her husband later died of cancer. The widow contended that she was entitled to the accidental death benefit authorized by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 86.093 (1949). In her petition to the circuit court, the widow argued that any determination of her rights by the trustees would be an unconstitutional deprivation of her property rights without due process because the trustees were not empowered to summon witnesses and documents and to administer oaths. The trustees were vested under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 86.037 (1949) with original and exclusive jurisdiction to determine claims for benefits from the police retirement system. The commissioner found that the widow was not entitled to raise a constitutional attack on the proceedings conducted by the trustees. She had not requested a hearing before the board of trustees. Thus, she could not complain that she was denied due of process of law until she exhausted her administrative remedy. The circuit court's jurisdiction was limited to review of a decision by the trustees. There was no basis for the court's jurisdiction of the widow's appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court adopted the commissioner's opinion and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question for decision was whether the intervenors had an absolute right to intervene under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 507.090 in an action that did not seek to condemn any rights in lands owned by them. Plaintiff gas company filed the condemnation suit alleging that it needed approximately 1800 acres for underground storage, which was located within a larger tract of 6000 acres which had underground formations suitable for gas storage. Intervenors said they had an interest because of the effects of storage of gas in the area upon water under their lands and because they will not be free to contract with others for gas storage under their lands. The court found that intervenors did not have an absolute right to intervene in this case and that they would not be bound by the judgement on any claim they might have for consequential damages. The court found the intervenors did not show that there was a taking. The intervenors did not even claim an easement in the lands described in the petition for condemnation.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the record showed that the judge never determined that the commission failed to comply with the statutory requirements for a condemnation proceedings and that he abused his discretion by indefinitely staying all of the proceedings in that action pending the resolution of an appeal of an involuntary dismissal that was issued in that proceeding. The court also determined that the appeal's outcome would not have affected the other landowners' rights because they were not parties to that appeal, which addressed issues that only affected the appealing landowners' rights as to the proposed condemnation of the land of which they were the sole owners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Levee District filed a petition to condemn or appropriate 7.29 acres of the land belonging to the property owners for a proposed plan for reclamation. The commissioners appointed to value such property awarded the property owners $ 601.40 in damages, and the Levee District filed exceptions. Seven years later, the property owners filed a motion to abate the proceedings and to quiet title to the real estate. The trial court granted the property owners' motion. On appeal, the court ruled that the trial court erred in abating the condemnation proceedings pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 245.145 because there had not yet been a condemnation of property owners' land. The court held that the proceeding was not subject to abatement until five years had elapsed from the date of filing of the commissioner's reports in the office of the recorder pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 245.145. The court further held that the five-year period had yet to commence because the trial court had yet to rule upon the exceptions filed by Levee District.

The boys were detained and were taken to the police, who took the boys home. The claimant filed a suit alleging false imprisonment and arrest against the railroad and the watchman. The trial court denied the claimant's motion for a directed verdict as to liability and upheld a jury verdict in favor of the railroad and watchman.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, individuals and an oil company, challenged a judgment of the Cole Circuit Court (Missouri), which affirmed a determination of a respondent Public Service Commission of Missouri that respondent public utility company could proceed to condemn land for the purpose of storing gas underground. The Commission granted the utility company's application pursuant to the Gas Storage Act of 1953, Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect;&sect; 393.410-393.510 (1949).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants drilled oil on land that the utility company wanted to condemn for use as an underground gas storage area. Appellants intervened and urged the Commission to deny the request for approval of condemnation proceedings. The Commission conducted hearings; the utility company presented scientific evidence, based upon geologic surveys and tests, which supported the property's intended use. Appellants' witnesses testified as to other underground storage areas that had leaked, but did not testify based upon the scientific evidence derived from the property. The Commission approved the request pursuant to Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 393.440 (1949) and the trial court affirmed. In affirming the court held that, while conflicting, the evidence supported the Commission's findings that a need existed for gas storage, that the property was appropriate for underground gas storage, and that increasing gas supplies was in the public's best interest. The Act merely set condemnation proceedings in motion and all impacted property owners would be compensated in the proceedings. The Commission's determination under &sect; 393.440 was a factual one of whether granting the request was in public interest.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) denied the mother's petition and entered a decree of adoption. The mother sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother claimed that the Adoption Code, Mo. Rev. Stat. Ch. 453 (1949), was unconstitutional, that the proceedings were not properly conducted, and that her consent was not freely granted. The court rejected these claims and affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court held that the mother misconstrued the relevant statutory provisions, that she did not waive the necessity of her consent to the adoption or to prior notice and a hearing, and that the code was constitutional. The court also held that all necessary parties were included, that the lower court had jurisdiction based on the residence of the child and the adoptive parents, that the requisite reports were filed, and that the guardian ad litem performed his duties. Despite her circumstances, the court held that the mother made her decision knowingly and that she was prompted by the belief that she was acting in the interests of the child. In addition, the court found that the child's health improved and that she was happy and content with her adoptive parents. Accordingly, the court held that the lower court acted in its sound discretion in denying the revocation of consent and in rendering the decree of adoption.</SPAN></P>

It challenged the constitutionality of the Missouri cigarette tax law. The law was approved by voters in an election pursuant to a referendum ordered by the general assembly. The partnership contended that the cigarette tax law was unconstitutional because the legislative bill was not signed by the speaker of the state house of representatives in accordance with Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 30. The court held that while Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 30 provided that no bill could become law until it was signed by the presiding officers of both houses, under the facts of the instant case, Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 30 was directory only and the failure of the speaker of the house to sign the bill was a procedural defect that had been cured by the approval of the voters on referendum. The court held that after an initiative measure had been passed by a vote of the people and promulgated as a law, alleged constitutional defects in the proceedings leading to its final passage would not be considered and that statutory provisions governing initiative and referendum procedure were to be considered directory only after an election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, former members of the Board of Election Commissioners of St. Louis County, Missouri, brought suit to recover from defendant county additional salary alleged to be due under Mo. Sen. Bill 254 (1951). The Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri) entered a judgment for the members. The county appealed, arguing that Mo. Const. art. VII, &sect; 13 applied and prohibited the salary increase to these county officials during their terms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The members argued that the constitutional provision did not apply to them because the legislature, in Mo. Sen. Bill 237 (1951), gave them duties in additional municipalities in the county. The court noted that the members were &quot;officers&quot; within the scope of the constitutional prohibition and the increase in salary was for the last 18 months of the four-year term for which they were appointed. The court added that the sole question was whether the members, as incumbent officers, could have made a showing which excluded the application of the constitutional barrier and permitted them to receive the financial benefit of the statute. The court determined that the members failed to point to anything from which it could have reasonably been concluded that the legislature intended that the provision for an increase in salary to become immediately effective as compensation for the added duties in the other bill. These were not shown to be companion measures. The court found that the bills were associated only in that both dealt with the same general subject, relating to the St. Louis County Board of Election Commissioners, and were enacted at the same session of the general assembly.</SPAN></P>

The candidate had filed suit against defendants, the members of the city board of election commissioners, the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General, to determine the validity of the 1952 division of the City of St. Louis into seven senatorial districts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purpose of Mo. Const. &sect;&sect; 5, 6 and 9, art. IV (1875), was to guard, as far as practicable, under the system of representation adopted against a legislative evil commonly known as the &quot;gerrymander&quot; and to require the legislature to form districts, not only of contiguous but of compact or closely united territory. Such constitutional mandate and standards could not be broken down or rendered inoperative on the theory of discretionary power. The court found that there was no discretion to violate mandatory provisions of the Constitution, certainly not by the administrative officers, and that the districting was unconstitutional and invalid. The court ruled that the board had a continuing duty to make a valid redistricting. The judgment was reversed, and because of the time element involved and in order to give the present board more time to divide the city into senatorial districts based on the last decennial census, instead of remanding to the circuit court with directions to enter declaratory judgment in accordance with the rulings made, the court entered such judgment as the lower court should have given, as authorized by &sect; 512.160(3).</SPAN></P>

The court held that the club met its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence the unlawfulness of the objective of the picketing. The court noted that Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 29 (1945) guaranteed employees the right to organize and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, uncoerced by management, union, or any other group or organization. Although peaceful, the picketing at issue was not &quot;organizational&quot; because its purpose was the accomplishment of an unlawful objective. The court concluded that the background of, and the circumstances under which, the picket line was established were compelling indications that the real objective was not to arouse public opinion but rather to affect so adversely the club's operation as to cause the club to coerce its employees into union membership.</SPAN></P>

The landowners filed motions to remand the exceptions to Pulaski County on the ground that Laclede County was without jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action. The court made its preliminary rule in prohibition permanent and held that the Judge was without lawful authority to remand the exceptions to Pulaski County because such an order to remand was in excess of that court's jurisdiction and because the Commission did not have an adequate remedy by appeal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relators, a city board of police commissioners and its members, sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, the mayor, city council, council members, and the city manager, to appropriate an amount in excess of the appropriation actually made to the board to meet the expenses of the police department pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 84.730 (1949).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city officials argued that the sum demanded and the sum appropriated were both in excess of one-sixth of the general revenue fund. The court found that: (1) the city officials could not make funds otherwise constituting general revenue unavailable to the state under &sect; 84.730 (1949); (2) the general revenue of the city devoted to special purposes or allocated to special funds by virtue of the city's charter and ordinance was to be included in one-sixth of the general revenue unless the ordinances and provisions justifying the allocations were enacted pursuant to express or clearly implied statutory or constitutional authority; (3) the amount of the general revenue fund had to be increased and the total potential liability of the city officials remained undischarged to the amount of difference between the increased amount and the amount originally claimed; and (4) it would be unjust to award any amount in excess of the amount lawfully required to pay outstanding obligations of the police department for lawful requisitions under &sect; 84.780 because the fiscal year in question was over.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court made the alternative writ of mandamus peremptory, but ordered that the amount to be appropriated should be limited to the lawful outstanding obligations of the police department.</SPAN></P>

Ordinance 46591, &sect;&sect; 19-24 (April 10, 1953). The trial court held &sect;&sect; 19-24, regulating retail auction sales, unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Saint Louis, Mo. Ordinance 46591, &sect;&sect; 19-24 (April 10, 1953) amended Ch. 7, &sect;&sect; 1-20, Rev. Code, City of St. Louis (1948). The auctioneers argued that Saint Louis, Mo. Ordinance 46591, &sect;&sect; 19-24 (April 10, 1953) restricted retail auction sales of jewelry, watches, clocks, or silverware, contravened Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40(30) (1945) prohibiting special laws, and denied equal protection of the laws under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The city argued that Saint Louis, Mo. Ordinance 46591, &sect;&sect; 19-24 (April 10, 1953) prevented fraud and deception, protected the financial welfare of citizens, and was valid under the city's police power. The court affirmed the trial court. Disreputable persons and itinerants were not eligible for an auctioneer's license. The court could not perceive how the restricted classifications affected public health, welfare, or safety of citizens. No distinctive circumstances justified limiting the right to conduct retail auction sales of jewelry to those authorized by Saint Louis, Mo. Ordinance 46591, &sect; 20 (April 10, 1953) while excluding others of the same class. The law failed to include all who were similarly situated and was a special law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff brought an action against defendants, a state administrator and a city bus company, to recover damages in the sum of $ 15,000 for personal injuries alleged to have been sustained due to the negligence of the operator of a bus upon which plaintiff was a fare-paying passenger. The Cole Circuit Court (Missouri) dismissed plaintiff's action and she appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that the mere issuance of a governor's proclamation and executive order without more, did not have the legal effect of converting the operating employees of the city bus company into state employees. The record was devoid of any evidence that the state administrator controlled the physical conduct of the operating employees of the city bus company. Under the evidence, there was no contract of employment, either express or implied, between the state administrator on behalf of the state and the operating personnel of the city bus company. The possession which the state administrator assumed was largely declaratory in nature. Obviously the city bus company remained in control as the managers of the bus business. Under the facts, the state did not incur any liability to persons injured as a result of operations during the seizure of the city bus company. None of the state's funds were used in the operation of the city bus company. At the time of plaintiff's alleged injury the city bus company was the employer and master of the operator of the bus in question, and it received and retained the income derived from the operation of the buses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court dismissing the case as to the state administrator. The court reversed the judgment dismissing the city bus company and remanded the cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, property owners and a corporation, challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), which granted the motion to dismiss of respondent city in an owner's action against the city under the Sawyer Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 71.015 (1949), alleging that the city failed to comply with the Sawyer Act in not seeking a declaratory judgment authorizing the annexation of property into the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed an ordinance to submit a proposition in the next general election to amend the city's charter by extending the corporate limits. An owner commenced an action against the city and another owner and the corporation intervened. The trial court dismissed the action on the basis that the Sawyer Act was unconstitutional as to the city because it limited the city's power to amend its charter as provided by Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 20. Appellants sought review. The court held that the city was a constitutional charter city, which was &quot;authorized&quot; through its electors, to annex territory by a direct constitutional grant of power. An attempt by the legislature to require a declaratory judgment by a court, &quot;authorizing&quot; a charter city to annex specified territory amounted to the delegation of a power to the courts that by the constitution was conferred upon the city and its electors. The Sawyer Act, which postponed the submission to the electors of an annexation proposal until a declaratory judgment action was filed and finally determined, conflicted with the procedure provided by Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 20; thus, it was invalid as to charter cities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relator State of Missouri Attorney General filed an information attacking the authority of the newly-created police department of St. Louis County to perform the law enforcement functions previously vested in the sheriff and constables of St. Louis County. It was directed against respondents, members of the board of police commissioners and the superintendent of police of St. Louis County. It was an original remedial jurisdictional writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">St. Louis County adopted a charter for its own government. The county council enacted an ordinance providing for the submission to the voters a proposal to amend the county charter. It adopted a second ordinance implementing the charter amendment with respect to the creation of the police department. The transfer of functions from the offices of sheriff and constables to the department of police was scheduled to become effective on a certain date. The attorney general challenged the members' and superintendent's authority to so act. The attorney general argued that the sheriff and constables of St. Louis County were not county officers within Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 18, but were state officers performing governmental functions which could not be taken from them by the charter of St. Louis County. The court denied the ouster. The court held that the ordinances and the charter amendments, both dealing with the mechanics of law enforcement, were in harmony with the Missouri Constitution. The charter and the ordinances were valid enactments and took precedence over general statutory provisions with respect to the agencies for law enforcement in the various counties of the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of ouster was denied by the court. The members and the superintendent's office were properly organized and established in accordance with constitutional authority. The members were therefore duly authorized members of the board of police commissioners of St. Louis County. The superintendent was the duly authorized superintendent of police of St. Louis County.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court dismissed defendant's motion without a hearing on the merits on the ground that a motion in the nature of a writ of error coram nobis was not the proper remedy for the State's alleged misconduct in coercing a witness into falsely testifying that the victim was not the aggressor in the affray in which defendant killed him. The court reversed the dismissal of defendant's motion and remanded the action, finding that the record showed that the motion alleged sufficient facts to require the hearing for which Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 27.26 provided. The court held that precedent showed that defendant's motion was to have been determined by the facts that it alleged and by the relief that it sought, rather than by the name that it was given. The court also concluded that a denial of due process occurred if the State suppressed evidence that was favorable to defendant and that defendant was entitled to a hearing because his motion and the records that related to his trial did not conclusively show that he was not entitled to any relief.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the allegations of prior convictions were not charges of distinct crimes but were merely to disclose facts bringing the offense within the statute and for determining the criminality of the new offense. The court further held that the evidence presented as evidence of defendant's prior convictions was inadequate and was not the actual judgment from the judgment docket of a court of record.

The provision of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 3.010 for taking over all existing sewers, constructed by public agencies, was likewise a necessary, proper, and valid provision. It was proper for the plan to provide for general taxation of tangible personal property as well as real estate. The portion of the property tax in the county in excess of that in the city was an invalid levy. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 7.180 did not invalidate the plan. As to the duties imposed on the city and county officers in assessment, levy, and collection of the sewer district taxes, the court held it was not improper. The sewer district was properly organized and established in accordance with the constitutional authority, the challenged powers were proper and valid, and the trustees were properly and lawfully occupying their positions as such.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant landowners appealed a judgment from the Cape Girardeau Court of Common Pleas (Missouri). A jury found that defendants were entitled to no damages after plaintiff landowners prevailed in their action under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 228.340-480 (1949) to establish a private road across defendants' land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs sought to establish, on the basis of strict necessity, a private road over defendant's adjacent land. Commissioners appointed by the trial court determined the location and the width of the road and awarded defendants $ 100 in damages. Defendants sought a jury trial on the issue of damages, and a jury awarded them no damages. The court held that title to real estate was not in dispute in the sense necessary to give the court appellate jurisdiction. Defendants' challenge to the constitutionality of the statutes under which plaintiffs filed their action was not timely raised because defendants did not present those arguments until their motion for a new trial. Defendants could not join in the procedure provided by the statutes, challenge primarily the amount of damages, and then contend for the first time in a motion for a new trial that the statutes were unconstitutional. Defendants' claim that they were denied due process because an easement was established without monetary compensation was essentially a claim that the judgment was erroneous. If the judgment was erroneous, it could be corrected on appeal before the proper appellate tribunal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The licensee argued that it was engaged in interstate commerce and the city's tax infringed on the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution by discriminating against and casting an undue burden on photographers engaged in interstate commerce. The city argued that the licensee was not engaged in interstate commerce and, thus, its license tax did not infringe on interstate commerce. The court agreed with the licensee and reversed the trial court's judgment. The court first noted that U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3 gave Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states. The court then noted that nonaction by Congress with respect to lawful subjects of commerce was a declaration that interstate commerce of such commodities should be free from local discriminating regulations by reason of its out-of-state production. In this case, the court found that the steps involved the licensee's business were part of an integrated interstate transaction. Thus, the court concluded that the city's ordinance violated the Commerce Clause by imposing a tax without regard to the substantial effects of the tax in unduly burdening interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

The court issued the writ of mandamus because there were sufficient funds to pay the warrant out of the class six funds, pursuant to Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 50.680. The court reasoned that, because the other funds had sufficient money to pay their debts and sufficient money in class six funds to pay all other outstanding debts, the warrant should have been issued out of the class six funds.

The railroad company contended that commission's order was reviewable to determine its reasonableness and lawfulness and that the commission committed reversible error in refusing to receive certain exhibits offered by the railroad company. The court stated that exhibits offered were too general in nature and did not reflect the actual conditions, past or present, at the crossings and that they had no probative value that would assist the commission in determining a fair and equitable apportionment of the installation costs for automatic protective equipment at the crossings.

The court then affirmed defendant's conviction. The court concluded that the contents of the publications tended to incite lascivious thoughts, arouse lustful desire, encourage breaches of the law, and encourage commission of crime, law violation, and moral decay. The court determined that the words set out in &sect; 563.280 created a clear and ascertainable standard of guilt that was readily comprehended. The court held that the statute clearly limited punishment to possession with intent to sell or circulate publications that were obscene, indecent, immoral, scandalous, lewd, licentious, or lascivious, as those words were formerly used and had always been understood.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff and the decedent were involved in a collision. Plaintiff commenced an action against the decedent, who later died. The decedent's representative was substituted under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.020 (1949). The representative sought to dismiss the action on the basis that &sect; 537.020 was unconstitutional in that it made no provision for notice to be given by the representative appointed by the probate court. The trial court dismissed the action and plaintiff appealed. The court held that neither the actions-against-nonresident-motorists law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 506.200-506.320 (1949) nor Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.020(3) subjected to the jurisdiction of Missouri courts the nonresident &quot;legal representative&quot; of a deceased nonresident motorist in an action for personal injuries caused by such deceased in the use of Missouri highways. Thus, the trial court had no jurisdiction over the representative.

The circuit court sustained the railway company's petition. The court affirmed. The court first noted that it was not concerned with the merits of the controversy. The court's role was solely to determine whether the interpleader was valid and the trial court had jurisdiction. The court held that pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 507.060, persons who had claims against the plaintiff could be joined as defendants and required to interplead when their claims were such that the plaintiff was or could be exposed to double or multiple liability. The court found that the stockholders did not have complete defenses in assertions of unclean hands or laches. The court found that the stockholders had failed to establish that conduct by the railway company called for the application of the doctrine of estoppel with the consequent denial of the railway company's right to maintain its action of interpleader.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The agency and the city entered into a cooperation agreement whereby the agency would clear an &quot;insanitary&quot; portion of the city in order for it to be purchased by a developer. The agency initiated an action for declaratory relief to construe the agreement. The intervenors claimed that the provisions of the Land Clearance and Redevelopment Law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 99.320(12)(c), 99.420 and 99.450, under which the parties based their actions, were unconstitutional. The trial court disposed of the issues in favor of the agency. The city and the agency claimed that the decree was not a detailed adjudication of their rights. The intervenors contended that the statutes allowed the taking of private property for private use since the land would be sold to a private developer. In affirming the decision, the court found that the taking was for a public use. The final determination whether the use of any property sought to be taken was for public or private use rested with the court. The finding that an &quot;insanitary&quot; area existed and a taking of the area was proposed for the purpose of clearance and improvement was conclusive evidence that the use was public, rather than private.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Governor of Idaho issued a demand to the Governor of Missouri for the extradition of the prisoner. The prisoner complained that the demand, and more importantly the rendition warrant, failed to comply with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 548.031 (Supp. 1953), a part of the Missouri Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, in that they did not allege that the prisoner had been in Idaho at the time of the commission of the offense or that he had fled from Idaho. In denying the writ the court held that while the prisoner won the battle, he lost the war. The court agreed that at least technically the rendition warrant did not comply &sect; 548.031. Nonetheless the court held that the papers before the Missouri Governor clearly indicated that the prisoner was a fugitive from justice under 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3182. This was what mattered, because to the extent that &sect; 548.031 placed more requirements for extradition than required by the federal statute it was repugnant to and therefore preempted by the federal statute. Because the rendition warrant satisfied the federal statute, it thus satisfied every valid prerequisite of the state statute, and the prisoner was subject to extradition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court discharged the writ of habeas corpus issued on the prisoner's petition, and remanded the prisoner to the custody of the sheriff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to the terms of the land clearance law, which allowed for the clearance of blighted and insanitary areas, the city activated the Authority and approved the exercise by the Authority of all powers authorized thereunder. The attorney general sought to oust the Authority claiming that the land clearance law was unconstitutional and that the Authority's activities were illegal. The court denied the ouster. The land clearance law was not unconstitutional. The clearance and redevelopment of insanitary or blighted areas was a public use which did not become private because of subsequent sales to private interests, as the same was purely incidental to the main purpose of the law. Further, the sale of the land to private interests at a fair price, but at a price less than the cost of acquisition, did not constitute the giving of special privileges, in violation of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 38(a) and 39 or Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 23 and 25. There was no unconstitutional taking of private property merely because sound structures and vacant land located within a blighted or insanitary area were acquired. There was no unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the Authority.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 202.780-202.870.

I, &sect; 15 (1945) as rendering the act invalid, the contention being that the medical certification, on the one hand, and the court order, on the other, served the same purpose as a warrant to arrest or detain a person in any other case, and as they were not based on or supported by written oath or affirmation, they were in conflict with that constitutional provision. The court determined that such provision was the one interdicting unreasonable searches and seizures. The act did not purport to provide for warrants. The court held for the statute in operation to deprive a person of his liberty without an opportunity to be heard in advance of commitment, if he or those acting for him desired it, would constitute a denial of due process, and accordingly rendered the statute, in its present form, unconstitutional. Because of the constitutional infirmity of the act, the court found that respondent's action in refusing to admit the proposed patient was justified. It followed that the alternative writ had to be quashed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant ordinance proponents sought review of a judgment from the Jackson Circuit Court (Missouri), which found in favor of plaintiffs, a city, a mayor, and city council members, in their declaratory judgment action to determine whether they were justified in refusing to submit the question of the enactment of the proposed ordinance to a vote of the people.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The proponents sought to compel an initiative petition that proposed an ordinance to create a firemen's pension fund. The city council refused to submit the proposed ordinance to a vote of the people because it doubted the legality of the ordinance. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment that found in favor of plaintiffs in their declaratory judgment action. The court was limited to an examination of the procedural matters when called on to interfere in the legislative process of enacting laws by the initiative method. Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 51 prohibited the use of an initiative for the appropriation of money other than of new revenues that were created and provided for in the ordinance. Kansas City, Mo., City Charter art. IV, &sect; 89 empowered the city council to review the budget to determine the need for expenditures and to determine the reliability of estimated revenues. The ordinance failed because it did not specify the new revenue that was to be used to support the appropriation. Also the failure of the ordinance to address the issue of the alteration of the city council's budgetary powers was a defect that constituted a procedural deficiency.</SPAN></P>

He asserted his right to run for state senator and that he was entitled to vote for state senators at large because the districts were void under Mo. Const. art. II, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The resident brought the action claiming that the city election board violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 8 when it redistricted seven senate seats in St. Louis. These districts, he alleged, were not contiguous, compact, and nearly equal in population. The circuit court dismissed the case. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of one claim that was predicated on the resident's candidacy for state senator at large. The court held that because the election for the senate seats had been held, the count was moot. Under Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 18 the state senate was the sole judge of the elections of its own members. The court took judicial notice of the fact that the election had been held and that members from the new districts were seated by that body. The court reversed the dismissal of the second count, which also challenged the constitutionality of the new districts. As a citizen and voter in the city, the resident was authorized to seek a judicial determination of the constitutionality of the senatorial districts established by the board. However, the claim against the city properly was dismissed because the petition presented no justiciable question regarding the city.</SPAN></P>

Except with regard to the claim against the city, the court reversed the dismissal of the other count requesting a declaration that he was entitled to vote for state senators at large. The cause was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer, a resident of respondent city, complained of a judgment of the Circuit Court of City of St. Louis (Missouri), which decreed that a proposed bond issue to acquire land and to install or equip buildings and facilities thereon for parking motor vehicles was valid. The City relied on Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 82.470 and 82.480 (1949) for its authority to issue the bonds. The taxpayer contended the proposed issuance of bonds was void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer contended that the ordinance authorizing the bonds was void because it violated St. Louis, Mo., Charter art. XVII, &sect;&sect; 1 and 3. The court found that the legislature, by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 82.470 and 82.480 (1949), expressly authorized the City to acquire land and to construct and equip parking facilities and to issue bonds in payment thereof. The enumeration in the charter of some of the purposes for which the bonds of the city might be issued did not impair any authority to make other improvements under &sect;&sect; 82.470 and 82.480. No election was necessary to authorize the bonds; they were not to be paid from funds raised through the taxing power of the city but were payable solely from income derived from the operation of the proposed parking lot. Sections 82.470 and 82.480 were not an attempt by the legislature to amend the City charter and did not violate Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect;&sect; 31, 32(a), and 32(a)(b). The City charter did not restrict the state legislature under its police powers in matters pertaining to the general public interest. The authority for the City to operate the parking lot in case it could not be profitably leased was necessarily implied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner sought to use its property as a home for convalescent and aged women. The abutters filed an action for an injunction barring such use, contending that under St. Louis, Mo., Ordinance No. 36797, the area was zoned for single family use. On appeal, the property owner contended that because the abutters had not shown that they had suffered any damages as a result of the proposed use, the trial court erred by granting the injunction. The court rejected this argument, holding that a showing of depreciation of value or of any special pecuniary damage was not essential to the maintenance of an action by the abutters against the property owner. The court then considered the property owner's contention that the ordinance was unreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory and confiscatory, and held that because the ordinance clearly delineated the zones and the permissible uses, the property owner's contention was without merit. The court further held that absent abuse of discretion or an excess of power not having a substantial relation to the public health, safety, and welfare, the ordinance could not be disturbed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowner challenged an order of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which entered judgment for respondent City, holding that the damages awarded to the landowner by the Commissioners of the Permanent Condemnation Commission of the City of St. Louis were reasonable and proper. Prior to the trial court's review of the landowner's exceptions, the court denied a peremptory writ to the landowner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner claimed that the trial court's denial of a jury trial was error. The court found that the ultimate question was whether the persons that St. Louis, Mo., Charter art. XXI, &sect; 3 was concerned with were similarly situated, or whether there was a distinction that justified the classification contained in &sect; 3. The court noted that the pivotal words were &quot;entitled to&quot; because Mo. Const. of 1945 art. XI, &sect; 4 provided that only corporations were &quot;entitled to&quot; jury trials as a matter of right in condemnation proceedings. However, the landowner never mentioned or attacked the constitutionality of St. Louis, Mo., Charter art. XXI, &sect; 3 in the trial court. Further, the landowner did not ask for a jury trial under &sect; 3, or contend that &sect; 3 denied the right to a jury trial. Thus, the landowner waived any rights under &sect; 3. The court also concluded that the landowner failed to preserve for review her claim concerning the legality of the Commissioners' appointed because she made no objection until after the Commissioners filed their report. Finally, the court held that the damages awarded by the Commissioners were not so grossly inadequate as to indicate an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees, who worked as building trade mechanics for the board of education, were members of the retirement system, which was established under 1943 Mo. Laws 805 et seq. By the 1953 Act, the employees' were among a class that was excluded from membership and coverage under the retirement system, and thus, their memberships were terminated. The 1953 Act, however, created an Equity fund for the benefit of all excluded employees and required respondents to transfer specified amounts from the retirement system to said fund. When respondents refused to create the Equity Fund, the employee's sought a writ of mandamus compelling respondents to comply with the provisions of the 1953 Act. The court denied the writ. The court held that the 1943 Act and its subsequent modifications created specific contractual rights in the members of the retirement system to obtain specific benefits upon compliance with the terms. Because those rights were vested, the creation of the Equity Fund under the 1953 Act unconstitutionally impaired contractual obligations. Thus, 1953 Mo. Laws &sect; 169.515 was invalid and respondents could not have been compelled to comply therewith by mandamus.</SPAN></P>

The court granted a provisional rule in prohibition. In making the writ of prohibition absolute, the court held that the subpoenas were void on their face. The court rejected respondents' contention that under the circumstances prohibition would not lie, holding that prohibition was a proper remedy to prevent a court from enforcing a subpoena that was illegal upon its face and to prevent a public officer from exercising a judicial act. The court found that under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 540.160, a subpoena could be issued to bring a witness before the grand jury. However, the court found that the circuit attorney had no authority to examine the documents outside the grand jury's presence. The court also found the subpoenas to be violative of Mo. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State confiscated a tractor-trailer containing whiskey. The State sought the forfeiture of the whiskey, claiming that it was contraband, and had been transported through the state without a permit. The intervenor claimed to be the owner of the whiskey and asserted that he had not known that the alcohol had been illegally transported. The trial court determined that the intervenor had not proven his ownership, and it ordered that the liquor be sold with the proceeds to be paid into the State's general fund. The truck driver and the intervenor appealed, but the court affirmed. The court first dismissed the appeal of the truck driver, holding that he did not have standing to contest the trial court's order. The court further held that the owner had not sustained his burden of proving his ownership of the whiskey to the trial court. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in ordering that the whiskey be forfeited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured brought a lawsuit against an insurer for property damage to his car and damages for loss of use. The insurer filed a motion to dismiss the petition for the reason that the insured had no cause of action against the insurer. The insurer claimed that because the insured previously refused to settle with the insurer, he waived any right to make a claim under the policy. The insured's counsel tried to strike the motion on the grounds that such objections and matters were not authorized by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 509.290 (1949), that &sect; 509.400 required that the insurer raise its defense by answer and not by motion, and that the matters set forth were insufficient to constitute a defense. The insured also claimed that granting the motion would have deprived him of a trial by jury as guaranteed under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 of Article I. The trial court sustained the motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court transferred the cause to the St. Louis Court of Appeals. The court noted that under Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3, the appellate court had exclusive appellate jurisdiction in all cases involving the construction of the Missouri Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The college was chartered in 1849 and its property was exempted from taxation in 1851. The college acquired property from an electric company in 1943 with the use of endowment funds, and the college leased the property back to the electric company. The rents were used solely for education purposes. The revenue commissioner attempted to levy property taxes against the electric company property for a series of years and brought action to collect them. The college argued that its property was exempt and counterclaimed for injunctive and other equitable relief. The trial court held that the property was used solely for the purposes of education, that the tax assessments were void, and that the commissioner was enjoined from assessing, levying or attempting to collect the taxes. The court on appeal held that the 1849 act that created the college, and the 1851 act that made its property exempt from taxation, should be construed together. Under both provisions, the college had the right to purchase the land and so long as rents therefrom were used solely for education, the property remained exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, respondent school board members were parties to the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school district authorized the use of its buses to transport parochial children, along with public school children, out of the district to a different district where a parochial school and public schools were located. The school board claimed that because the parochial children were transported on the same buses that carried public school children and because the schools attended by all of the transported pupils were not those of the school district, there was no expenditure to the benefit of the parochial children by the school district. The lower court's judgment refused the taxpayer's request for an injunction against the transportation of the children. The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that ultimately school district monies were spent on behalf of the children, and, therefore, the taxpayers had a right to maintain their action. The expenditure of school district funds on the parochial pupils violated Mo. Const. art. IX, &sect; 5 (1945) because &sect; 5 required that all funds earmarked for public schools had to be used to maintain free public schools and for no other purposes whatsoever. Thus, Mo. Ann.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers argued that the county treasurer was collecting and spending public monies of the State in support of schools which were not free public schools but were in fact parochial schools. The court held that there was no merit in the county treasurer's contention that the taxpayers could not maintain the action because, as residents and taxpayers of the State of Missouri and of their respective school districts, there could be no question as to the taxpayers' right and legal capacity to bring and maintain the action for themselves and on behalf of all others similarly situated to enjoin the unlawful expenditure of public funds. The court concluded that the schools in question were in fact controlled in the main by members of recognized orders of the Roman Catholic Church and were managed and administered in a manner to promote the interests and policies of the Roman Catholic Church. Therefore, the court held that the schools were not in fact free public schools and were not entitled to be supported by public school money or public funds.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayers sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which upheld the constitutionality of St. Louis, Missouri, Ordinance No. 46,222 (1950), enacted pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92.110 et seq., and permitted the city to levy an earnings tax. Respondents, the city, its mayor, and its tax collector, claimed the tax, which was limited to four years, was a valid exercise of the city's powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92.110 et seq. (1952) provided that any city of 700,000 inhabitants could levy an earnings tax of up to one percent on net profits of businesses, salaries, wages, and other compensation, and was by its terms to expire in two years. The taxpayers claimed that the ordinance and &sect; 92.110 violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40, which prohibited local or special laws, and Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 11(f), concerning the levying of taxes other than ad valorem taxes by counties. On review, the court found that the Missouri General Assembly had the power to allow the city to enact an emergency earnings tax, that &sect; 92.110 was legislation of limited duration, and that its application to cities of more than 700,000 did not offend the rule against special legislation. The court ruled that ordinance was not unconstitutional even if the meaning of the term &quot;net profits&quot; was interpreted by the city tax collector as distinguishing between those in business for themselves and wage earners because the classification was rationally related to the city's goal of collecting a tax on all profits earned within the city limits. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court upholding the constitutionality of the ordinance and its enabling legislation against the taxpayers' challenge.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs contended that such expenditure was not authorized by statute nor was it constitutional. The court disagreed. The court found that although no constitutional provision expressly authorizes such an expenditure, if payment for workmen's compensation for the school board's employees was a &quot;grant of public money,&quot; the proposed expenditure of public school money was one authorized both by the constitution itself and by legislative action not prohibited by the constitution. The court found that the Workmen's Compensation Law was the exercise by the state of its police power and was to be construed liberally. Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 25, empowered the legislature to authorize payments from any public funds into a fund or funds for paying benefits upon retirement, disability, or death to persons employed and paid out of any public fund for educational services, and to their beneficiaries or estates.</SPAN></P>
