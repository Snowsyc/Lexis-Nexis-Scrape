<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him of soliciting for the purpose of prostitution in violation of City of Birmingham, Ala., Gen. Code &sect; 11-7-33(b) (1980). The trial court rejected the argument that the ordinance violated defendant's due process rights under the Fifth Amendment or was overbroad in violation of the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city ordinance made it unlawful to loiter for the purpose of prostitution and allowed police officers to consider prior convictions and repeated conduct. On appeal, the court followed decisions from other jurisdictions and held that the ordinance was not so vague as to violate the Due Process clause of the Fifth Amendment because it outlined specific conduct, in addition to loitering, which the officer was required to observe, and limited the extent of the statute to loitering for the purpose of perpetrating a specific crime. The court also found that the ordinance required proof of intent that could be inferred by conduct but did not violate due process by shifting the burden of proof to defendant or creating a presumption of guilt. The court noted that police officers could not make arrests arbitrarily or on a whim. The court further held that the ordinance was not overbroad in violation of the First Amendment because it was aimed at prostitution, which was not a protected activity. The court also found that evidence that defendant was dressed as a female and flagging down cars late at night in an area known for prostitution was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 32-8-87(c) (1975), concluding that the statute was arbitrary and capricious in nature, an abuse of the police power of the state, and violative of defendant's rights of due process of law and the equal protection of the laws. The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the owner of a junk or salvage yard. The indictments charged defendant with the failure to remove the manufacturer's identification number plates from either junk, salvage, or total loss motor vehicles in his possession. The appellate court reversed the trial court's judgments quashing the indictments and remanded the cause.  Ala. Code &sect; 32-8-87(c) (1975) did not deny defendant equal protection of the laws and was not arbitrary and capricious because the statute applied to all junkyard owners equally and the class defined by the statute was reasonable. The statute was not unconstitutional because it imposed strict liability without a requirement of intent or knowledge. The statute was not aimed at penalizing the possession of stolen property and could not be invalidated on the basis that it permitted convictions even where the vehicles at issue were not stolen. The statute did not place vicarious liability upon junkyard owners for negligent acts of their agents, servants, or employees. Finally, the statute was a valid and constitutional exercise of the state's police power and the means of enforcement adopted thereunder were not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree rape. Defendant denied that he raped the prosecutrix. Defendant asserted that his three previous felony convictions occurred prior to the enactment of the Alabama habitual felony offender statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9 (1975), and the trial court's use of these convictions to enhance punishment constituted a retrospective application of the act. The court held that the act did not punish defendant for past conduct, but merely increased his punishment for his latest offense. Defendant next claimed that selective enforcement of &sect; 13A-5-9 violated the equal protection and due process clauses of the United States Constitution. The court held that the mere showing of selective enforcement of a statute, without more, was not constitutionally impermissible. It was insufficient to show only that the law was enforced against some but not others. A showing of actual and purposeful discrimination against each individual himself or against a class in which he falls was necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Tuscaloosa Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him for robbery in the first degree and later sentenced him to life without parole when the Alabama Habitual Felony Offender Act under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9(c)(3) (1975) was invoked upon a showing of seven prior felony convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was identified as the man seen carrying away a box of tool from another man's truck. When confronted, defendant pulled a knife and warned the truck owner. The trial court convicted defendant and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The court affirmed. After the jury returned its verdict, the State informed the trial court that it was requesting a sentencing hearing so that it could present evidence as to defendant's record. The State gave written notice under Ala. R. Crim. P. 6(b)(3)(ii). The court held that due process did not require advance notice prior to trial on the substantive offense that triggered the Act. The legislature alone was given the authority to fix the maximum and minimum punishment for all crimes. No discretionary power was given to the trial court. The court held that the Act was not unconstitutional. Granting parole was a matter of discretion left to the legislature. It was not cruel or unusual punishment to say that a habitual criminal should receive the punishment based upon his criminal proclivities. The court held that life imprisonment without benefit of parole was not cruel or unusual punishment and not in conflict with U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was convicted of murdering a former prison acquaintance with whom he became involved in an altercation, contended he had been denied a fair trial due to highly prejudicial statements the prosecutor made during closing argument. The statement of the prosecutor suggested that if convicted, defendant would probably be paroled or on probation before long. The trial court gave the jury curative instructions, but defendant nevertheless maintained a mistrial was in order. The State contended that the disputed statement was not an impermissible reference to parole, but merely a response to a previous argument by defense counsel. Affirming, the court found that, based on so much of the disputed arguments that was presented in the record, the prosecutor had virtually restated points of argument originally made by defense counsel. Because he was refuting defense counsel arguments and because the trial court judge gave the jury adequate curative instructions, no grounds for a mistrial existed. Further, the court concluded that another disputed statement by the prosecutor connected with defendant's theory of self-defense was not any sort of comment on his failure to testify.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the evidence presented by the State established a prima facie case that defendant had violated either a city ordinance or a State statute regarding public drunkenness, thus his initial arrest was valid; (2) there was no evidence that defendant made incriminating statements after his arrest; however, even if there had been, there was no evidence indicating that defendant's intoxication was to a degree as to cloud his ability to understand his rights; (3) although the trial court improperly admitted a knife that a police officer found in defendant's car, the error was rendered harmless by the trial court's prompt removal of the knife from consideration and curative jury instructions; and (4) the trial court's denial of defendant's request for an affirmative charge was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were each indicted for 14 counts of violating the Alabama Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Ala. Code. &sect; 20-2-70(a) (1975), by being in possession of a number of different controlled substances seized from their automobile, and they appealed their convictions in the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) and their sentences as to 11 counts of possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' car was parked on a remote road near a seldom-used airstrip, and they gave evasive answers to police questions. In affirming their convictions for possession of controlled substances, the court held that there were specific and articulable facts which gave rise to a &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that defendants were engaging in criminal mischief. The officers merely stopped their car and questioned defendants as to their activities, a minimally intrusive procedure. The circumstances and factors established that ample probable cause existed to justify the officers in believing that defendants were concealing contraband in the plainly visible duffel bags. It was clear that, given the probable cause to believe that the bags contained contraband, the officers were entitled to enter the vehicle and seize the bags, and it was proper for the officers to search the bags immediately rather than waiting for a warrant. In remanding for sentencing, the court stated that its reading of Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-70(a) (1975) made possession of controlled substances to be a felony with only one scheme of punishment. As one offense had been committed, only one sentence was authorized.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was convinced from the evidence of defendants' overwhelming guilt and therefore affirmed both of their convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge and then filed a request to enter a guilty plea. The judge questioned him and the judge accepted his plea. He was sentenced under the State's Habitual Offender Statute because he had eight prior forgery convictions in which he was given a 16-month sentence that was probated. The circuit court denied defendant's motion to exclude the prior felony convictions from the record. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in applying the statute because defendant's sentence was within the range prescribed by the statute. The court determined that the statute did not contain a requirement that a repeat offender had to serve his sentence from a prior felony before he could be considered a habitual offender. Therefore, the court held that it was irrelevant that defendant's sentence was previously probated for his other felony offenses. However, the court also held that defendant's conviction for marijuana was not available for consideration under the statute because the State failed to show that counsel represented him or that he waived his counsel at the time of the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court was justified in concluding that the circumstance did not adversely affect the voluntariness of the incriminating statement. The court noted that, although the police officer did not tell defendant that he was charged with murder before the statement was taken, he did tell defendant that he wanted to talk to him about the killing. The court found that there was evidence independent of the autopsy report that the victim's death was caused by the stab wounds. The court noted that the county coroner, who had examined the victim's body, testified that in his opinion the cause of the victim's death was hemorrhage due to multiple stab wounds.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Morgan Circuit Court (Alabama) convicting defendant of hard labor for violating Ala. Code &sect;13-6-226 (1975). Following a series of demonstrations around a county courthouse, a trial judge signed and issued an order prohibiting from the courthouse people who failed to show that they had specific business with the trial court or associated offices. Defendant was arrested after refusing to comply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Copies of the order were posted on all outside doors leading into the courthouse. On that same date defendant came to the courthouse, and a deputy served a copy on him. Defendant returned to the courthouse the next day and was asked by deputies to state his business. He stated that he needed to go to the registrar's office and also to talk with the sheriff. The deputies then admitted him to the building. On another day defendant and two companions again returned to the courthouse. Defendant refused to state his business in the courthouse and refused to leave. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 13-6-226 was applied to him in an unconstitutional manner, denying him his First Amendment rights. The court held that: (1) the evidence clearly showed that defendant and his two companions came to the courthouse for the purpose of disobeying the order; (2) the United States Constitution did not forbid the State to control the use of its own property for its own lawful nondiscriminatory purpose; and (3) the State was free to adopt safeguards necessary and appropriate to assure that the administration of justice at all stages was free from outside control and influence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that after carefully examining the record, there was no indication that the trial judge was in any manner seeking to punish defendant for electing a jury trial on a not guilty plea. The court reasoned that there was no evidence that the trial court had accepted the two-year sentence, acknowledged the sentence, or promised defendant that he would have received that sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that that the vendees were not injured parties and their property was not damaged. The court also found that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a mistrial. Defendant claimed that he was improperly questioned as to whether he had previously been on probation. The court found that although the prosecutor improperly emphasized the offense reversal was not warranted. The court reasoned that the trial court had strongly instructed the jury to disregard such question. The court also found that a mistrial was not warranted based upon the prosecutor's statements during closing arguments. The court reasoned that there was a reasonable basis for the prosecutor's statements that defendant knew the law, that defendant had stated he was going to make the vendees rich, and that there were some questions that could not be asked.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted for unlawful trespassing in violation of a city ordinance and the jury fixed the punishment of each at a fine of $ 100. Defendants contended that the ordinance upon which each was tried was inconsistent with Ala. Code &sect; 13-2-100 (1975) and thus it was invalid. The difference in the laws was that the State law did not permit one to trespass upon the property of another, even though the trespasser may never have been warned not to do so. The court affirmed defendants' convictions and concluded that the city ordinance under which defendants were charged and tried was not inconsistent with general statutory law of Alabama. The court found that the State statute was not exclusive and the city ordinance properly enlarged the provisions of the State statute by requiring more restrictions that the State law. The court ruled that a marketing director of the mall had agency authority to give a valid warning against trespass on behalf of the property owners. Also, the court concluded that the testimony relating to the defendants' assault upon a store owner was admissible in order to show that the warnings given were not based on discrimination against defendants.</SPAN></P>

Defendant paid the weekly bill late because his company did not timely send the check. After defendant missed several weekly payments, the manager filed the charges against him. The manager admitted that defendant did not refuse to pay his bill, he simply failed to pay it and failed to keep his promise to pay it timely. The conviction was reversed. The court held that the trial court should have granted defendant's motion to exclude the manager's testimony because the evidence was insufficient to prove a prima facie case that defendant defrauded the innkeeper. The court stated that defendant's failure to keep his promise to timely pay the weekly bill did not amount to an offense under &sect; 34-15-18 because he did not have the requisite specific intent to defraud.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally indicted and convicted under the Alabama Death Penalty Act for robbery and first degree murder. That conviction was reversed and remanded. Defendant was then tried twice under the original indictment. Each trial resulted in a mistrial because of a hung jury. Then defendant was convicted in the Etowah Circuit Court (Alabama) of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the &quot;reindictment&quot; provision of the Alabama Death Penalty Act was unconstitutional and violated the constitutional provisions against double jeopardy. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's murder conviction. The court held that the fact that a second indictment was filed against defendant was of no constitutional significance. An indictment was not subject to abatement because another charge was pending against defendant for the same offense. The court also found that defendant's plea of former jeopardy was without merit. Defendant was not convicted of a higher offense on retrial, and the State did not gain some advantage by the retrial. However, the court did remand the case for a hearing because defendant asserted that his confession should not have been admitted given that his arrest was illegal, and the record did not show what reasons police had to believe that defendant was involved. The record submitted to the court in response to that direction showed, without question, that the police had ample probable cause to arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arresting officer purchased an obscene magazine from defendant's place of business. On appeal, defendant raised several claims. The court rejected these claims and affirmed the conviction. The court held that a jury trial was not required on the issue of community standards in an obscenity prosecution and that defendant was not deprived of due process of law. In addition, the court held that there was no evidence of any intentional selectivity based upon an unjustifiable standard, and thus rejected defendant's claim that the city ordinance was systematically and selectively enforced against him in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although the affidavit for the arrest warrant was insufficient to establish probable cause, the court held that this insufficiency was cured because the allegedly obscene matter was presented to the magistrate along with the affidavit; together, the affidavit and the magazine were sufficient to support a finding of probable cause. Further, the court held that any error from the prosecutor's remark regarding defendant's failure to testify was rendered harmless by the lower court's curative instructions.</SPAN></P>

The jury instructions charged the jury as to murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, manslaughter in the first degree, and manslaughter in the second degree. Defendant excepted to a part of the court's oral charge while instructing the jury on murder in the second degree.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after a police officer observed defendant driving a motor vehicle in an erratic manner. Defendant was driving from one side of the street to the other and kept crossing the center lane. The officer noticed a strong odor of alcohol on defendant's breath. Defendant had difficulty in getting out of his car and could hardly walk. His speech was badly slurred. On appeal, defendant contended that the ordinance under which he was prosecuted was unconstitutional because it was inconsistent with the state statute prohibiting driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Specifically, defendant contended that the city ordinance enlarged the prohibition against a person driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of narcotic drugs to include driving while under the influence of any other drug which rendered him incapable of safely driving. The court rejected this contention, holding that one who operated a motor vehicle after ingesting a drug which rendered him incapable of safely driving or operating a vehicle violated state law. The court concluded that the city ordinance challenged merely elaborated on, and was not in conflict with, state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of killing two males, ages 14 and 16, by shooting them with a pistol at a roller skating rink. On appeal from his conviction, defendant argued that the trial court erroneously excused four jurors for cause, admitted the victims' clothing, admitted his confession, and sentenced him to death. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that (1) the challenges for cause were proper because the four jurors stated that they could not have found defendant guilty where such a finding required imposition of the death penalty; (2) admission of the clothing was proper where it tended to show the character, location, and nature of the fatal wounds; and (3) defendant's confession was admissible because he was read Miranda rights and voluntarily confessed. The court, however, remanded for a new sentencing hearing because the trial court based the death sentence on three aggravating circumstances, none of which was found in the capital felony statute,&nbsp;Ala.

Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court committed reversible error in asking the jury foreman, in his absence, whether or not the jury wished to discontinue its deliberation to retire for the evening because under these circumstances the trial court deprived him of his constitutional right to be present during his trial. The court ruled that the matter of the duration of jury deliberation was within the discretion of the trial court, and that if the trial court decided to delegate that decision to the jury it could do so.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted her on four counts of possessing illegal drugs in violation of the Alabama Uniform Controlled Substances Act, Ala. Code tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 258(25)-258(60) (Cum. Supp. 1973) (Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 20-2-1 through 20-2-93 (1975)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Illegal drugs were seized when a search warrant based on a tip from a confidential informant was executed at the motel that defendant operated and where she resided. After her arrest, her motion to suppress the evidence was overruled. In affirming her conviction under the Act, the court held that an affidavit in support of the warrant that was based on the informant's hearsay statements stated that the informant was known to be reliable and cited specific supporting circumstances. Defendant's motion to exclude was properly overruled. Knowledge of the presence of illegal drugs could be established by circumstantial evidence; guilt under the Act did not depend on ownership. Evidence showed that defendant had conducted drug transactions at the motel, had substantial control over the motel, was present during the search, and was in actual possession of codeine found in her purse. The Act was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power and did not violate due process. The Act did not delegate authority to define crimes but only to find facts or determine the existence or nonexistence of a factual situation or condition on which the operation of the Act depended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. It was further stated in additional paragraphs appended to the opinion that defendant's conviction was reversed as to one count on her appeal from the court's affirmance of her conviction; on remand from that further appellate proceeding, the court remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of breaking into and entering, in the nighttime and with intent to steal, an inhabited dwelling and intentionally killing the occupant of the dwelling in the course of the burglary. The jury fixed punishment at death. The Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) refused to accept the death penalty as fixed by the jury and sentenced defendant to life without parole. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the exclusion for cause of prospective jurors who objected to capital punishment subjected him to a &quot;prosecution prone&quot; jury in violation of his constitutional rights. He alleged that a jury chosen based on a belief in the death penalty was necessarily biased in favor of conviction. That contention was initially asserted on appeal. No evidence was presented to the trial court on that issue. The court held that it would not presume a fact not shown by the record and make it a ground for reversal. Defendant contended that the sentence of life imprisonment without parole was disproportionate and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The co-defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of nighttime burglary and was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. He admitted aiding defendant in breaking into the victim's house and stealing her property but denied any participation in the killing. The trial court determined that defendant's mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating circumstances. While defendant's sentence was disproportionate to his co-defendant's, the co-defendant was not found guilty of killing the victim.</SPAN></P>

The court further found that the trial court was not in error in overruling the motion or in ruling against defendant on the particular point in any other motion or request by defendant. The court reasoned that the evidence showed that defendant's picketing activity was not a contest between religious and anti-religious. The court found that defendant did not have a constitutional right to enter the church in order to spread his religious belief because trespass upon property was not a legally justifiable when committed in the course of evangelism. The First Amendment afforded defendant no protection in what he was doing; it afforded members and visitors of the church concerned freedom and security against what he was doing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of selling obscenity. On appeal, defendant argued that under the United States Supreme Court's definition of obscenity, only a jury could apply &quot;contemporary community standards&quot; in determining whether the publication was obscene. Defendant claimed that his obscenity prosecution was exception to Ala. Code &sect; 12-14-6 (1975), which provided that all municipal cases would be tried by a judge. The court agreed that obscenity prosecutions required trial by jury. The court held, however, that defendant never raised the issue below. He therefore waived the issue on appeal. The court agreed that the warrant affidavit was insufficient to provide probable cause for his arrest. The court noted, however, that the officer presented the magistrate with the magazine, which he examined for ten minutes before issuing the arrest warrant. The affidavit, together with the presentation of the alleged obscene matter to the magistrate, supported the finding of probable cause and issuance of the warrant despite the fact that the affidavit was conclusionary. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that this was in error and challenged the constitutionality of the statute under which she was convicted as well as various due process and trial issues.

The court found that defendant failed to carry her burden of proof as to an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel during her trial. The court determined that defendant did not have a right of access to grand jury testimony because the prosecution did not examine witnesses from grand jury notes.

The court held that: (1) defendant did not preserve his challenge to the trial court's refusal to allow defendant to inquire about the victim's use of birth control because defendant refused an in camera hearing that was required pursuant to Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for burglary by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama). Defendant and an accomplice broke open the back door of the victim's house and stole her wallet. A witness, who saw both of them leave the victim's house, identified them when they were detained by police several blocks away. The detaining officer heard over the police radio that two black males had been seen in the area of the burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's billfold was not found on defendant, but its contents were. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the burglary statute, Ala. Code &sect; 13-2-40 (1975), contending it constituted &quot;cruel and unusual&quot; punishment in that, although the crime of burglary was much less serious than that of murder, the maximum punishment for both was life imprisonment. The court held that it would violate the principle of separation of powers for the judiciary to vitiate legislation merely because it felt the prescribed punishment too severe for a particular crime, and that defendant, who received the minimum sentence for burglary, had little standing to challenge the maximum punishment. The court also held that: (1) it was not error to admit the testimony of the officer as to what he heard over the police radio because it tended to justify his action in stopping the men for questioning; (2) there was no error in admitting the billfold of the victim and the currency found on defendant because the connection between them and the victim had been established; and (3) the search of defendant was permissible because, once the witness had identified him, probable cause existed for his arrest.</SPAN></P>

The check was issued before he closed his business or filed bankruptcy. Neither was the Worthless Check Act unconstitutional for being used to collect civil debts. The statute was saved by its requirement that intent to defraud be shown.

A victim was killed while defendant and his co-defendant robbed a store, and defendant implicated himself in the crime while incarcerated on other charges after repeatedly being advised of his rights and signing two waivers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant offered testimony and newspaper reports to show jury bias, claimed he was denied a competency exam, and challenged a local act allowing prospective jurors with legal excuses to be excused outside his presence. Defendant challenged the proof as to his intent and a local jury selection law that differed from state laws. In its oral charge, the trial court quoted two refused defense instructions and omitted some of that language in a supplemental charge without objection. The trial court found the victim's death unnecessary without stating whether that finding supported or defined the aggravating circumstance. The court found that the public was not completely biased, that excusing jurors with legal excuses outside defendant's presence was proper, and that the inculpatory statement was admissible. The court held that defendant was clearly an accomplice in the crimes and found no infirmity in the local jury procedures. It found no error in the &quot;borrowing&quot; of defendant's instructions and held that defendant was entitled to resentencing based on noncompliance with the capital felony sentencing rules.</SPAN></P>

An officer testified that when the two were questioned, defendant's shoes were covered with what appeared to be dried blood and the co-defendant had a tooth missing, a bruise on his cheek, and cut and swollen hands.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice went to the store with the intent to commit robbery. The accomplice waited in the car while defendant entered the store, shot the clerk once in the abdomen, fumbled with his gun and reloaded it, shot the clerk a second time, stole cash, and fled. A jury found him guilty of an intentional killing during a robbery and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the court found that the circuit court properly excluded a juror who was opposed to the death penalty. The affidavit supporting the arrest warrant, even if insufficient, was supported by adequate oral evidence to create probable case. Admission of defendant's confession was not error, because he received all the necessary constitutional warnings and instructions yet later agreed to talk to the police without an attorney. The circuit court's rulings on the admission of photographs and on a continuance were not an abuse of discretion. The circuit court's findings of guilt were supported by substantial evidence. But during sentencing, the circuit court's consideration of criminal charges that did not result in convictions, and consideration that the felony was committed for pecuniary gain were improper.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the trial court was vested with broad discretion in the excusal of prospective jurors. Further, the court held that a sentence of death could not be carried out if the jury that imposed or recommended it was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction. Also, the court found that the prospective jurors would not impose the death penalty under any circumstances, even if they felt that the death penalty was justified by the facts and evidence in the case.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was convicted under &sect; 13-1-75 of first degree murder while serving a life sentence, and given a mandatory death sentence. His direct appeals were unsuccessful and his petition for writ of error coram nobis was denied. The court affirmed, rejecting the inmate's argument that the statute was unconstitutional as applied. Because the Death Penalty Act was not effective when the crime occurred, &sect; 13-1-75 was the only statute under which the state could have sought the death penalty. The inmate presented no evidence of intentional selectivity based on arbitrary or invidious standards, and the jury was instructed on the lesser included offense of second degree murder. The court found that the inmate was seeking to use the writ as a delayed appeal of issues that could have been decided on direct appeal. The issue of the jury's consideration of mitigating and aggravating circumstances was decided adversely to the inmate on direct appeal. The inmate's attack on the jury selection system was waived because he did not raise it at trial or on direct appeal.

Defendant also orally objected to the jury venire because persons over 70 years of age were excluded. The trial court denied the motions. The court affirmed, and held that: (1) defendant failed to carry his burden of proving actual prejudice in his defense that resulted from the delay in bringing him to trial; (2) defendant's objections to the jury venire were not preserved for review because the motion was never submitted to the trial court in writing; (3) no error was committed in the admission of a witness's out-of-court photographic identification of defendant because the witness was subject to a most searching and vigorous cross-examination; and (4) the use of defendant's mug shot in a photographic array was not error because defendant did not object to the introduction of evidence of his prior arrest for possession of dynamite.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that from the record it could not be determined whether he was tried in accordance with Ala. Code &sect; 13-11-8 (1975). Section 13-11-8 provided that each person indicted for an offense punishable under the provision of this chapter who was not able to afford legal counsel must be provided with court appointed counsel having no less than five years' prior experience in the active practice of criminal law. Absent some tangible indication that the requirements of the statute were not met, the court held that it could not summarily rule as a matter of law that the statute was not complied with. Furthermore, the court held that the aggravating circumstance of a capital felony committed for pecuniary gain was not applicable when the underlying crime was robbery. However, the court held that the aggravating circumstance in defendant's case was not that he committed a crime for pecuniary gain, but that he committed the capital felony for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting an escape from custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction, after trial by jury in the Tuscaloosa Circuit Court (Alabama), for first degree murder with a prior conviction of second degree murder in the 20 years preceding the crime. He was sentenced under the Alabama Death Penalty Act (Act), Ala. Code &sect; 13-11-2(a)(13). Defendant claimed that the prior conviction was improperly admitted because defense counsel was ineffective. He also argued the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree murder in 1957. He appealed that conviction, arguing that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel because defense counsel represented him and his father, who was also charged in the same murder. His conviction was affirmed on appeal. He argued that the conviction should not have been admitted into evidence because he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel on appeal due to counsel's failure to inform him that he could have proceeded in forma pauperis on appeal and obtained a free transcript. On appeal, the court ruled that defendant was represented by competent counsel at the 1957 trial for murder in the second degree and on appeal, therefore, his 1957 conviction was valid and properly admitted into evidence in his trial for first degree murder. The court held that counsel was not ineffective for failing to inform him that he was entitled to a free transcript because in 1957, the law was unclear that defendant had such a right. The court also held that there was no constitutional barrier to the imposition of the death penalty for a single act of murder, of which defendant was convicted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. With regard to the sentence, the court remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to provide a statement of &quot;the findings of fact from the trial&quot; as required by the Act. The court also ordered that the trial court specify whether or not there were any mitigating circumstances, in accordance with the Act.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the warrant was invalid because the official who issued it was not an attorney. Defendant further argued that there was a factual deficiency in the affidavit upon which the search warrant was based. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court rejected defendant's contention that the warrant was invalid. The court also recognized that an experience narcotics agent made the affidavit on which the warrant was based. The court further rejected defendant's argument that his conviction should be reversed because a police informant who smelled burning marijuana in the hotel room was not qualified to testify about the odor of marijuana smoke. The court noted that the affidavit showed that the informant was credible and reliable. The court further stated that the officer's affidavit contained other information that was sufficient to support the warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which was entered on the jury's verdict that convicted defendant on five counts of the violation of 1976 Ala. Acts 645 (Act), Ala. Code &sect; 22-1-10 (Supp. 1978), and set a specified fine for each count. The jury found that defendant made false statements or representations of a material fact in a claim for payment to the Medical Services Administration of Alabama (MSA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant worked at a nursing home (home) and, as part of the payment process to the home, submitted a cost report to the MSA for work that was done by employees of the home. However, the cost report represented salaries that were paid to relatives of the home's owner despite the fact that they never substantially performed work at the home. Defendant was indicted for the violation of the Act, and the trial court entered a judgment that convicted her of the same. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict of guilt. The evidence, and the inferences drawn therefrom, showed that defendant included in the cost report a false statement or false representation of a material fact with the intent to deceive the MSA into making higher payments to the nursing home than were legally due to it. Defendant's demurrer to the indictment against her was properly overruled because the State adequately set out the constituents of the offense in substantially the same language as that used in the Act. The court held that the necessary criminal intent was set out in the Act and that such intent appeared in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was riding in an automobile over which he had no charge or control. An officer stopped the automobile for weaving and reckless driving. The driver was arrested for driving while intoxicated. Defendant was placed under arrest for occupying or riding in an automobile while intoxicated. Defendant was convicted of the charged offense. The appellate court affirmed the conviction. On appeal, defendant argued that Tarrant City, Ala., Traffic Ordinance No. 617 (1977) was unconstitutional because it went beyond, extended, and enlarged the scope of the state statute regulating the consumption of alcoholic beverages, specifically, the &quot;drunk driving statute&quot; found in Ala. Code &sect; 32-5-170 (1975), and the public intoxication statute, Ala. Code &sect; 13-6-15 (1975). The court held that: (1) &sect; 13-6-15 specifically exempted a passenger in an automobile from its criminal sanctions for public intoxication; (2) the ordinance in question prohibited an act which was permitted by the state law of Alabama, and, thus, the ordinance was in conflict with state law; and (3) the ordinance was invalid as an improper use of a municipality's police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence revealed that defendants, a husband and a wife, took the victim, a girl under the age of 12 years, with them on a car trip through parts of Alabama.

A doctor who examined the victim indicated that she had bruising on her vaginal and rectal areas and that she had been penetrated. A jury found each defendant guilty of carnal knowledge as charged in the indictment, and the trial court sentenced the husband to 20 years' imprisonment, and the wife, who had been convicted as an aider and abettor, was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment. In affirming the convictions, the court held that under the facts in the record, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury verdict finding the wife guilty as an aider and abettor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's contention that the Alabama death penalty statute, Ala. Code &sect; 13-11-6 (1975), was unconstitutional because the jury could not consider aggravating or mitigating circumstances because the trial jury's verdict recommending a sentence was only advisory. The court determined that the admission of defendant's confession was not error. The fact that his confession was obtained in the absence of his attorney did not render it involuntary, and error could not be ascribed to its admission because he testified to essentially the same facts at trial. The court found that the trial court did not err in denying his challenge of a venireman for cause because the venireman stated that he could find defendant not guilty if he had a reasonable doubt. Although the court agreed that the prosecutor could not argue certain prejudicial matters to the jury, the court found that the fragmentary quotes from the trial court's record were insufficient to present any alleged prejudicial effect of his statements for review. The court conducted an independent review of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the statute stated that it was be unlawful for (1) a practitioner of dentistry to prescribe certain drugs to a person not his patient, or (2) a practitioner of veterinary medicine to prescribe certain drugs for human use.

Subsequently, the Covington Circuit Court (Alabama) heard evidence on mitigating and aggravating circumstances, adjudged defendant guilty, and set forth written findings of facts to support the imposition of the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his wife allegedly killed a store owner. The court held that the trial court did not err in: failing to change the venue of the case based on newspaper articles concerning defendant; excusing jurors outside the presence of the defendant under authority of 1971 Ala. Acts 200; granting the State's challenge for cause where a juror's answers on voir dire revealed an emphatically held opinion against capital punishment; or admitting photographs of the deceased lying in a pool of blood. The trial court correctly admitted defendant's confession. The trial court's admonitions to the jury to disregard testimony as to defendant's wife's polygraph examination negated the possibility of error. Defendant's contention that the attorney-client privilege was breached by a one-way intercom system used at a jail to monitor the prisoners was without substantiation. The admission of evidence heard over the intercom that defendant shouted at his wife that &quot;if she hadn't shot him, we wouldn't be in this mess&quot; was not error. The prosecutor's reference to defendant as a &quot;rat&quot; did not warrant reversal. The trial court did not err by failing to charge the jury in lesser included offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the jury found defendant guilty and fixed his punishment at death. At a post-conviction hearing, the trial court reduced defendant's punishment by to imprisonment for life without parole. Defendant argued that the Death Penalty and Life Imprisonment Without Parole statute violated the federal and state constitutions by violating the rights not to plead not guilty and to demand a trial by jury. The court affirmed. In a capital case in the trial courts of Alabama, a jury, and a jury alone, had authority to fix the punishment at death. The constitutional and statutory law did not permit the trial court, without a jury, to try or fix the punishment in a capital case. There was no constitutional right not to have a jury trial. Thus, the trial court could not approve and the State could not consent to an attempted waiver by defendant of a jury trial. The jury was required to pass on the question of defendant's guilt or innocence once he was indicted under the Death Penalty and Life Imprisonment Without Parole Act, and the jury was required to fix defendant's punishment if he was found guilty.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that there was no error in the admission of the confession. The court held that the confession was admissible because there was no allegation or evidence of coercion, and the proper predicate had been laid for its admission. The court reviewed the confession and found that the confession itself did not admit to any crime, but simply stated the facts of the incident, and upon those facts the district attorney determined the crime. The court also held that the carnal knowledge statute was not unconstitutional because the State had an interest in protecting young girls from abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that &sect; 26-15-3 was too vague and indefinite to be enforceable as a penal statute. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that the state new child abuse law, Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 26-15-1 to 26-15-4 (1975), was constitutional. The use of the words &quot;willful abuse&quot; and &quot;torture&quot; in defining what constituted child abuse was not so vague and indefinite as to render the statute void for vagueness. Each term had a commonly understood meaning, which did not leave a person of ordinary intelligence in doubt as to its purport. Defendant contended that the indictment was insufficient to inform her of the crime she was charged. Defendant was charged with torturing, willfully abusing, cruelly beating, or otherwise willfully maltreating her daughter by beating her with a belt and hand. The court found that the indictment stated sufficient facts, in ordinary and concise language that enabled defendant to understand the nature of the crime and to prepare her defense.

He entered a guilty plea in the trial court (Alabama) to murder in the first degree, with the sentencing recommendation of life without parole, which was accepted by the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a full and complete hearing on the voluntariness of defendant's guilty plea and after full advice by the trial judge as to defendant's constitutional rights, defendant was allowed to enter the guilty plea to first degree murder. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence pursuant to the guilty plea, rejecting defendant's argument that he was coerced to enter the plea based on the State's recommendation for favorable sentencing based on mitigating circumstances. The court held that (1) the Alabama Death Penalty Statute, Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13-11-1 (1975) et seq. was not unconstitutional, and (2) the trial court did not lack of authority to accept a plea of guilty instead of conducting a jury trial where defendant was indicted of first degree murder under the death penalty statutes. The death penalty statutes did not expressly authorize the acceptance of a guilty plea in capital murder cases. Such procedure was authorized in capital cases by virtue of Ala. Code &sect; 15-15-24(a) (1975), which allowed the taking of a guilty plea by the trial court when, in the opinion of the trial court, a lesser punishment than the death penalty was warranted by a particular case.</SPAN></P>

The conviction arose from an indictment that alleged defendant had, with malice aforethought, willfully set off or exploded dynamite other explosives in, under, or dangerously near an inhabited dwelling house in which a human being was lodged and intentionally killed. Defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. The court found that the trial court had properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the introduction of photographs depicting the victim after the explosion because they tended to shed light on the character and location of the wounds on the body of the victim. The court also found that the police had been justified in carrying out a warrantless search on his vehicle, which turned up evidence helpful to the state's case, because of the mobility of the vehicle and the searching officer's knowledge that defendant's vehicle had been seen at the blast scene. Finally, the court upheld the sentence of death because the trial court's findings in support of the sentence were fully supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Butler Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him of murder. The murder occurred during a hardware store robbery in which defendant struck the owner in the head multiple times with a blunt instrument causing fatal injuries. The jury fixed defendant's punishment at death. Defendant challenged numerous rulings by the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Among the errors alleged by defendant was that the circuit court erred in failing to dismiss a juror who had stated that she was a distant cousin of the victim without determining the exact degree of affinity or consanguinity. Defendant also challenged the sentence on the grounds that the circuit court had failed to adequately set forth the grounds for imposing the death penalty. The court held that Ala. Code &sect; 12-16-150 (1975), imposed a duty on the circuit court to determine the precise degree of relationship of a juror to a victim when that issue was raised. The court further held that Ala. Code &sect; 13-11-4 (1975), required the circuit court to set forth in writing findings of fact regarding the aggravating circumstances and mitigating circumstances that had led it to impose the death penalty. Since this had not been done, the court remanded the case to the circuit court. On remand, the circuit court made the required findings regarding the juror's relationship to the victim and the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The court held that these findings were sufficient. The court found defendant's various other allegations of error to be without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a minor, but over 16 when the crime was committed. The evidence revealed that several witnesses saw defendant exit a shoe shop after they heard a loud noise that sounded like a blast or explosion. Other witnesses saw defendant running through traffic, and one witness's testimony led police to the murder weapon and some of the clothing defendant had on when he exited the shoe shop. After defendant's fingerprints were found on the front door of the shoe shop, he was arrested and advised of his constitutional rights. Defendant later confessed to the shooting. At trial, defendant argued that he was incapable of giving a voluntary confession because he was mentally retarded. On appeal, defendant argued that his death sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment, that his confession was inadmissible because it was involuntary, that the state improperly discriminated against him and other mentally retarded criminal defendants, that a photograph of the deceased was inadmissible, and that, but for his confession, the state failed to prove the corpus delicti of the attempted robbery as charged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted under the Death Penalty Statute for the robbery and first degree murder of a victim. The jury found defendant guilty as charged and fixed punishment at death. The trial court thereafter conducted a post-conviction hearing on the aggravating and mitigating circumstances as required by law. The trial court then pronounced judgment, which left punishment at death by electrocution. Defendant asserted that the Death Penalty Statute was unconstitutional because the jury could not consider the aggravating or mitigating circumstances, thus the death penalty was mandatory and therefore violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The court held that the statute had been upheld by the court as against the same contention in numerous prior cases. Defendant contended that the statute was unconstitutional in that it did not provide for comparative appellate review of sentencing. The court noted that Ala. Code tit. 15, &sect; 382(10) (Recomp. 1958) did provide for appellate review of sentencing.

Code tit. 36, &sect;&sect; 154-158 (1973), and that the admission into evidence of his refusal to take a blood test violated his guarantees against self-incrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After having drinks at a housewarming party, defendant was involved in a motor vehicle accident that resulted in a death. At the hospital, he refused a blood test. A jury convicted him of manslaughter in the first degree. The court affirmed, holding that the Alabama Chemical Test for Intoxication Act, specifically Ala. Code tit. 36, &sect; 154(c), did not grant defendant the &quot;right&quot; to refuse to submit to chemical testing. Evidence of defendant's refusal to take a chemical analysis test violated neither U.S. Const. amend. V or Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 (1901), which guaranteed the privilege against self-incrimination, because the inferences flowing from defendant's guilty conduct were not testimonial products. The testimony regarding defendant's refusal to submit to chemical testing was competent circumstantial evidence of his guilt. Defendant had no right to consult with an attorney or a physician before agreeing or refusing to submit to the chemical test. There were no extraordinary circumstances that precluded defendant from submitting to the test, other than his own conscious refusal to take it, where there was little evidence that defendant would have been harmed by bystanders.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that although there was a conflict in the testimony as to the number of grand jurors in attendance, it was not disputed that at least 15 were present.

The court held that, upon examination of the record, defendant received a fair and impartial trial and that it could not find any error to have occurred. As to defendant's alleged points of error, the court concluded: (1) that the Alabama Death Penalty Act, Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13-11-2 et seq. (1975), was constitutional and that defendant had not asserted any grounds for invalidating the statute which the court had not previously considered; (2) that the trial court properly dismissed two prospective jurors for cause due to their stated irrevocable inability to apply the death penalty regardless of the proof presented; (3) that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for a continuance because there was no showing that any of the prospective jurors had been prejudiced by the newspaper articles; (4) that defendant's confession was admissible because the State had shown that he had received his Miranda warnings and that it was voluntarily made; and (5) that the trial court had properly held a post-conviction hearing under the Act.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the trial court did not err in refusing defense counsel's request to argue the legal effect of certain requested charges before submitting them to the trial judge because, in the absence of any showing that defense counsel had any arguments of law to present, there was no reversible error. The court concluded that there was no evidence in the record that was an abuse of discretion resulting in an infringement upon defendant's constitutional rights. The court held that defendant's motion for a mistrial was properly denied because the question by the prosecution was eradicable and defendant never secured a ruling on his objection to the State's questions and consequently failed to preserve any error for review.</SPAN></P>

A search of the home made before defendant arrived produced paraphernalia and various drugs, and a small amount of marijuana was found in the woman's car, which defendant was driving when he arrived. The trial court refused to suppress the fruits of the search, which included mail addressed to defendant at the searched address, and it questioned witnesses about the details of their testimony. Defense witnesses testified defendant lived alone and apart from the woman, and that they had been to his home several times. The court found that the informant's hearsay information was sufficiently credible, that conclusory statements of reliability sufficiently demonstrated the informant's veracity, and that the warrant was properly limited in scope. The mail had a sufficient nexus with the crime to create probable cause to seize it, and defendant could not challenge the affidavit underlying the warrant absent a showing of a material or intentional misrepresentation by a government agent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a decision of the trial court (Alabama), which convicted defendant of assault with intent to murder and sentenced him to a term of 12 years in the penitentiary. The victim was defendant's 16 month-old daughter. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial in which he raised the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence established that defendant beat the child so as to inflict serious and extensive wounds and that the child suffered from battered child syndrome. Further, defendant admitted that he was mad with the child and that he used a belt in inflicting those injuries until the child fainted. On appeal from the judgment of conviction for assault with intent to kill, the court affirmed. Assault with intent to murder was an assault to take life under circumstances which if successful would constitute murder in either degree; the intent element was an inference to be determined by the jury from clearly established facts. After applying those standards, the court found that the assault was vicious and vigorous and that there were no excusing circumstances. Further, there was a presumption in favor of the correctness of a jury's verdict, and a verdict of conviction could not be set aside for insufficient evidence unless the preponderance of the evidence against the verdict clearly convinced the court that it was unjust. Given the ample evidence, the court held that a jury question on defendant's guilt was presented and that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on the police officer's affidavit that an informant had witnessed the sale of heroin at an apartment, a search warrant was issued. Defendant was visiting the apartment when it was searched. Defendant was not a suspect or named in the search warrant. At the end of the search, one of the police officers asked a reporter to take a picture of him and defendant. During the picture taking, defendant's hat was knocked off his head and the police officer discovered the heroin. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that the affidavit was legally insufficient to support the issuance of the search warrant because it failed to show that the information received from the informant was fresh as opposed to remote. The court also found that the search of defendant's hat impinged upon his constitutional rights and was thus unreasonable and without probable cause. The court reasoned that the fact that defendant associated with narcotics dealers did not call for inference that defendant was engaged in the criminal traffic of narcotics. The search could not be justified on the theory that the heroin was found as a result of a frisk for weapons.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Montgomery County (Alabama), which denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus alleging that he had been deprived of good time credit under 1976 Ala. Acts 182 by the Alabama Board of Corrections without due process of law. Petitioner also asserted that his sentences were to run concurrently and not consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that 1976 Ala. Acts 182 allowed the Board to award incentive good time credit to prison inmates in exceptional cases of good behavior and industriousness. The state attorney general issued an opinion declaring that the statute apply retroactively, and petitioner's release date was computed accordingly. A later opinion stated that the statute would not have retroactive application, and the Board rescinded its earlier calculation of petitioner's release time based on the good time credits. The Supreme Court of Alabama had recently resolved the alleged equal protection issue based on the fact that some inmates were released based on good time credits before the attorney general rescinded its opinion regarding retroactive application. The supreme court had held that the statute was not intended to be retrospective, and that the fact that some inmates were prematurely released because of a misapprehension of the statute could not work a discrimination, as the Board was not legally or constitutionally required to perpetuate its mistake. Because petitioner's sentence did not explicitly provide for concurrent sentences, his sentences were to be served consecutively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged their convictions entered in the Blount Circuit Court (Alabama). Defendants were convicted of murder under Alabama's Death Penalty Act (Act), Ala. Code tit. 15, &sect;&sect; 342(3) to 342(11), that was committed during a robbery. They had separate jury trials and the jury fixed the punishment at death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants and another followed the victim, whom they knew always carried large sums of money. They took the victim to a remote location and one defendant shot the victim, killed him, and took his wallet and money. Defendants were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The court held that the trial court's oral charge to the jury on the presumption of malice from the use of a deadly weapon was correct in every respect. The trial court was correct in sustaining the State's challenge to a juror for cause. Alabama's Death Penalty Act (Act), Ala. Code tit. 15, &sect;&sect; 342(4) to 342(11) met the concerns expressed in Furman v. Georgia and passed constitutional muster when measured by the pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court. The procedures served to assure that the sentence of death would not be wantonly or freakishly imposed and squared with the constitutional standards enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States. The aggravating circumstances found by the trial court were amply supported by the evidence in this case. The verdict of the jury was overwhelmingly sustained by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana and was sentenced to four years imprisonment. He sought a writ of habeas corpus and contended that the penalty provision of Ala. Code tit. 22, &sect; 258(47) (1940) violated the federal equal protection clause and the federal due process clause. He claimed that the indictment brought under the code was deficient because it failed to notify him whether he was charged with a felony or a misdemeanor. The trial court denied his application, and petitioner sought review. The court affirmed. It found that the indictment that charged felony possession of marijuana embraced the lesser offense of misdemeanor possession of marijuana for personal use. Therefore, petitioner was on notice of the charge against him. Furthermore, petitioner's guilty plea purged the record of error because he failed to show that his plea was extorted by duress, fraud, intimidation, or deception.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pleaded not guilty and filed a demurrer and a motion to strike the affidavit and complaint on the ground that Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary thrust of defendant's demurrer and motion was that tit. 14, &sect; 275 was a denial of equal protection of the law as applied against defendant and the game of bingo because it was not uniformly enforced against all games of chance. In dismissing the charges, the trial court concluded that bingo was played with impunity and that numerous groups sponsored the game to raise funds without law enforcement action being taken against them. The court dismissed the State's appeal. The court found that the State did not have the right to appeal the trial court's decision dismissing the charges against defendant on the ground that the enforcement of the statute was a denial of equal protection of the law as applied against him. The court stated that the controlling statute, Ala. Code tit. 15, &sect; 370 (1940), allowed the State to appeal when an act of the legislature, on which an indictment or information was preferred, was held to be unconstitutional. Thus, tit. 15, &sect; 370 did not provide for an appeal by the State where the enforcement of the statute was held to be unconstitutional but the constitutionality of the statute itself was not questioned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed an order from a trial court (Alabama), which sustained defendant's demurrer to an indictment charging her with child abuse, a violation of 1971 Ala. Acts 2422, codified at Ala. Code tit. 14, &sect; 41(1) (1958), and discharged defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for the offense of child abuse, and she filed a demurrer to the indictment alleging that the indictment was defective. The trial court sustained the demurrer and discharged defendant based on its finding that the Act under which the indictment was returned violated Ala. Const. art. 4, &sect; 45 in that the scope of the body of the Act exceeded the scope of its title, and thus was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's order. A careful reading of the Act demonstrated that the title of the Act was narrow and restrictive in that the offense defined in the title required an evil mind; the offender must have wilfully committed the act. The offense defined in the body of the Act, however, required no such mental state, but rather a physical act. Thus, the title to the Act was more restrictive than the body. Moreover, the Act was vague and uncertain, as defendant could have been put in an impossible position in preparing to defend herself against charges of &quot;unjustifiable pain&quot; or &quot;ordinary and reasonable punishment.&quot; These were subjective terms, and there were no standards whereby one could have determined what constituted the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant was arguing with the victim. The victim walked away and defendant threw a beer can at him. The victim turned toward and defendant stabbed the victim. Defendant testified that he acted in self-defense. Before defendant was about to take the stand to testify as to threats the victim made to him, the trial court discussed with counsel the testimony's admissibility. In front of the jury, the trial court expressed reluctance about admitting the statements because defendant could just say whatever he wanted to on the stand. The trial court allowed defendant's testimony and gave instructions to the jury to disregard his remarks. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's remarks were tantamount to a direct comment on the credibility of defendant. The court noted that defendant's testimony as to the victim's threats and his perception that he was subject to grievous bodily harm were critical to establishing self-defense. The court concluded that under the circumstances, the trial court's attempts to correct the error were insufficient to undo or neutralize the harm caused by his statements, which were made at such a critical point during the trial.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the conviction was proper. Section 714 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the federal Constitution or Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 106 because the classification based on a county's size was not unreasonable or arbitrary. Section 714 did not violate the unified judicial system under Ala. Const. art. VI, &sect; 139 where the system only dealt with how the courts were organized and not with peremptory challenges. Defendant did not prove a violation of the Equal Protection Clause where the State used its peremptory challenges to strike all blacks from the jury pool because there was no showing of whether blacks were stricken from jury pools where a defendant was white or where the victim was black. There was sufficient proof of a rape, though defendant only partially penetrated the vagina.

Counsel for the defense had a right to make a closing summation to the jury, no matter how strong the case for the prosecution may have appeared to the presiding judge. A total denial of the opportunity for final argument in a nonjury criminal trial was a denial of the basic right of the accused to make his defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a prison riot during which he and another inmate overpowered two guards and freed the other inmates from their cells. One of the guards was killed and the other seriously injured during the prisoners' self-styled revolution. Defendant claimed that he was forced to participate in the murder for fear of his life. A jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree and the trial court sentenced him to death under Ala. Code tit. 14, &sect; 319 (1940). The court affirmed, determining that defendant failed to meet his burden to establish discrimination on his motion to quash the indictment or the petit jury venire where he claimed that there was an under-representation of black members on the petit jury venire. The trial court did not err in sustaining the state's objection to three jurors who refused to impose the death penalty. Defendant was not entitled to an instruction regarding compulsion in the commission of a homicide where he knew of the plan to kill one or more of the prison guards before the riot and could have easily alerted the prison officials of the impending riot. The mandatory death sentence under &sect; 319 was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Reversing defendant's conviction, the court held that the trial court erred in permitting the physician to testify as to the cause of death because the State presented no competent evidence that the physician had ever seen the records or was familiar with the diagnosis or treatment the victim had received at the hospital and thus did not lay a proper foundation. The court also held that the death certificate could not be used either alone or in conjunction with other documents introduced pursuant to 1965 Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed a complaint against defendant for violating &sect; 43-1, which provided that no female could prostitute herself or use any indecent or lascivious language, gestures, or behavior to induce any other person to illicit sexual intercourse. A police officer testified that defendant approached him and told him that she would perform certain sexual acts at her apartment for a certain sum. Defendant testified that the officer approached her and asked her to go out for a good time. She claimed that when she said no, she was arrested. Defendant filed a demurrer, contending that her equal protection rights were being denied because &sect; 43-1 applied to female prostitutes and not male prostitutes. The city overruled defendant's demurrer. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that &sect; 43-1 was vague and overbroad. The complaint did not constitute the crime of prostitution. Defendant's alleged proposition to perform sexual acts for a named sum of money went no further than that. There was no bedroom affair, no disrobing, no touching of the bodies, no money paid, and no sexual activity. In short, the crime of prostitution was not committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue on appeal was the attempt to enforce the &quot;blue laws&quot; on a nondiscriminatory basis so as to comply with the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. At all times pertinent to the case, there was no fixed or settled policy by city law enforcement officers with respect to the enforcement of such &quot;blue laws.&quot; Moreover, the arresting officer admitted that he did not have a complaint to investigate defendant's place of business, which was in violation of the established police department to investigate Sunday violations only on complaints. Furthermore, the arresting officer conceded that he knew other businesses, which were in direct competition with defendant's business, were open on Sunday and did not visit those places to see if they were in compliance with the &quot;four-employee&quot; ordinance. Thus, the court concluded that defendant's constitutional rights had been violated and that his arrest and conviction had been brought about by invidious discrimination in the unequal enforcement of the municipal &quot;blue laws.&quot; The court accordingly reversed.</SPAN></P>

A-719, which made it unlawful for nets to be used for any type of commercial fishing purposes in all impounded public waters in which Morone saxatilis had been stocked. Defendants filed motions to quash the complaints against them on the basis that the Regulation was unconstitutional. The trial court denied defendants' motions to quash. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found the regulation did not violate defendants' civil rights where there was nothing unreasonable about the regulation and there was evidence that the regulation was based upon scientific studies. The court held that the state owned the fish in its sovereign capacity and as a trustee for the people of the state. The court determined the specific area of commercial fishing was not an industry within the meaning of Ala. Code tit. 8, &sect; 21 (1940) where the legislature had not seen it fit to declare commercial fishing as an industry. The court concluded the regulation was legitimately related to the object of its promulgation to conserve and promote growth and increase of stripped bass in the public waterways.</SPAN></P>

The jury rejected an insanity defense after the trial court had instructed them on the Parsons rule. Defendant sought review. The court held that: (1) the trial court properly refused to charge the jury that defendant was not guilty if they found that he had a mental age of six years because the issue was for the jury; (2) the sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment under Ala. Const. &sect; 15 and U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV because the relevant statute punished the act of sexual molestation and not mental retardation; (3) under Ala. Code &sect; 426 (1940), the trial court should have inquired further into defendant's mental capacity to stand trial; and (4) the test was whether defendant had the capacity to comprehend the nature and object of the proceedings, and whether he could conduct his defense in a rational manner and cooperate with his attorney in the preparation of his defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was arrested for threatening to kill a victim in the presence of a police officer and for committing assault and battery on the victim on two occasions. The statute required a bail hearing and required a bond where there was a just reason to fear the commission of an offense, but the statute did not require an appearance at any court unless he actually committed an offense. After the bond was required, petitioner sought the writ. Granting the writ, the court said that the bond was excessive, exorbitant, oppressive, and served no other purpose than to assure petitioner 12 months servitude for a threatened offense not punishable under the law. The court was confronted with an impermissible discrimination that rested solely on petitioner's inability to post bond due to abject poverty. The statute as applied to petitioner worked an invidious discrimination solely because of his financial circumstances and economic status. To delay a disposition of the case only served to further deny petitioner the relief to which he was entitled.</SPAN></P>

The court held that expression by means of motion pictures was included within the free speech and free press guaranty of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The court reversed the convictions of defendants, concluding that after carefully reviewing the ordinance in question, it was clear that such was an unconstitutional prior restraint on freedom of expression. The court held that the ordinance failed to provide even the most minimum constitutional safeguards, such as (1) prompt judicial review on the merits of the administrative determination by the censor that the material is unprotected expression, and (2) to place the burden of initiating judicial review and proving that the material in question is unprotected expression on the censor, and (3) to limit the preservation of the status quo to the shortest fixed period compatible with sound judicial resolution of any restraint imposed in advance of the final judicial determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant had entered guilty pleas to several misdemeanor charges, including driving while intoxicated, public drunkenness, no automobile tag and no drivers license, and carrying a concealed weapon. He was granted three years' probation, was directed to obtain treatment for an alcohol problem, and was ordered to pay a fine. When appellant was convicted of additional misdemeanor charges, his probation was revoked and he then sought to tender appeal bonds for the original misdemeanors. The trial court rejected the bonds as untimely, and appellant the filed the petition for writ of habeas corpus. On review, the court held that the trial court properly denied appellant's habeas corpus petition because a writ of habeas corpus could not be used to replace a writ of error or an appeal. Further, the trial court proceedings had been regular on their face and no invalidity appeared. The court rejected appellant's contention that being placed on probation tolled the time provided for taking appeals from the trial court, finding that by acceptance of probation, appellant's sentence was not suspended and that the time for taking appeal had been properly computed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a manager and operator of an adult theater, appealed a decision of an Alabama circuit court, which entered judgments in eight cases, finding that defendants violated Birmingham, Ala., City Code Mun. Ord. No. 67-2 &sect; 2, by knowingly exhibiting obscene motion picture films.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City made a separate case for each film, and the circuit court properly found that all films were obscene under standards set forth in Ord. No. 67-2, &sect; 2 and those established by the U.S. Supreme Court. Also, the circuit court properly denied defendant's plea of former jeopardy because the eight reels were not precisely the same in law and fact. The trial court's application of the Supreme Court standards for obscenity did not constitute an ex post facto application because such challenges pertained to laws and not judicial decisions. Further, the standards related to the burden of proof and not to a new constitutional standard. The circuit court properly found that, under the standards, the films appealed to prurient interests, depicted sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and lacked literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because the Supreme Court standards were read into the ordinance, and the ordinance was constitutional on its face. The First Amendment did not require that a fact finder consider &quot;national standards&quot; for a determination of obscenity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold tickets to an entertainment event to undercover agents at a higher cost than their stated cost, which violated both ordinances. On appeal, he alleged that the ordinances violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments and that the trial court erred in overruling his demurrer to the charges. The court agreed and reversed defendant's convictions. The question had not been considered by the Alabama appellate courts, but it had been decided by the U. S. Supreme Court. The ultimate question was whether the sale of such tickets by scalpers on the city streets so affected the public interest and was of such importance as to be the subject of price fixing regulation under the police power of the city. The court held that the ordinances in fact transcended the limits of the police power, and constituted an arbitrary interference with private business by imposing unusual and unnecessary restrictions upon a lawful occupation. Thus, the court held that the ordinances were unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

He was arrested for blocking the portion of the sidewalk that was restricted to protesters.

The court ruled that no specific intent to breach the peace was essential to a conviction for a breach of the peace. The court found that by occupying a portion of the walk prohibited by the agreement between the protesters and the police, defendant could have encouraged a similar violation by the other participants, ultimately resulting in a confrontation with the sheriff and his deputies. The court found that the act and defendant's defiant manner was apparently calculated to cause the group of demonstrators to react when the sheriff approached him.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the conviction of defendants, two of the three defendants appealed. Prior to trial, motions were filed to suppress evidence discovered as a result of a search of trailer home, under a search warrant. Defendants alleged that the affidavit in support of the warrant was not based upon facts showing probable cause for search and issuance of the warrant. The court examined the affidavit and the warrant and concluded that they were based upon evidence sufficient to show probable cause. There was no error in the trial court overruling the motion to suppress the evidence. The court also found that defendants' motion to dismiss the prosecution was properly overruled. The court held that in a prosecution for unlawful possession of narcotics it was not necessary to prove actual possession, but rather constructive possession. Furthermore, it was proper for such guilty knowledge to be established by circumstantial evidence; guilt did not necessarily depend upon ownership. Also, defendants failed to raise the question of the disqualification of a juror before trial, the court determined, therefore, that this issue was waived.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. There was no error in overruling defendant's motion to suppress because there was no &quot;search&quot; of which appellant could complain, nor was there any &quot;invasion of privacy&quot; as the officer was invited into defendant's residence by his younger brother. Likewise, the marijuana was not rendered inadmissible because of any &quot;unreasonable&quot; seizure perpetrated by &quot;fraud, deceit, and trickery.&quot; The court also held that the inclusion of marijuana in the Alabama Uniform Controlled Substances Act did not violate the equal protection clauses of the Alabama or United States constitutions. Due to the great disparity of opinion as to the ills and effects of marijuana, the court was unable to take any judicial notice of whether marijuana was so unlike the other drugs in the Act as to be unreasonably included therein. The court further held that the prosecutor's questions to defendant's witnesses regarding whether they had ever used drugs was not reversible error.

The court further held that although defendant's motion to produce physical evidence should have been granted if timely presented, the trial court did not err in denying it given that it was not presented until more than three months after it was filed. However, the court held that the trial court's instructions were reasonably calculated to impress the jury that the misdemeanor of possession of marijuana for personal use was not embraced in the indictment although, in fact, the indictment embraced the misdemeanor and the jury could have inferred from the evidence that defendant had the marijuana for his personal use only.

The circuit court sentenced defendant to the penitentiary pursuant to Ala. Code tit. 14, &sect; 106 (1940, recompiled 1958).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim accompanied defendant to get a dog. As they passed a wooded area, defendant threw the victim onto the ground, threatened him if he told, snatched off his clothes, and committed certain sexual acts. Defendant testified that the victim accompanied him to get a dog but nothing happened. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, defendant claimed that &sect; 106 was too vague and indefinite to apprise him of the charges. Defendant also contended that there was no evidence of a crime as charged in the indictment. Finally, defendant argued that there was no proof of penetration. Defendant's conviction was affirmed. The court found that &sect; 106 merely fixed the punishment for the offense and was constitutional. The court rejected defendant's argument that the victim's words and phrases in narrating the acts of defendant in commission of the alleged offense were not sufficiently specific to prove the crime. Defendant did not object or move to exclude the testimony. The court noted that the jury was well acquainted with, and understood, the words and phrases of the victim. Lastly, the testimony of the victim and his mother was sufficient to submit the issue of penetration to the jury.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was punished with a fine and a sentence of hard labor. The trial court heard the case without a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plain clothes policemen went to an adult theater, made an offer to buy tickets, which was refused, and, after identifying themselves as police officers, entered the theatre over defendant's protest. The officers began a video-tape recording of a film. After serving defendant a notice of the charge, the officers continued their filming of other &quot;short subjects&quot; and another feature film. An officer then took the video tapes--containing material shown both before and after the notice was served--to a city recorder. After viewing the materials, the city recorder issued a warrant for defendant's arrest. The trial court viewed three separate video tapes consisting of material exhibited both prior and subsequent to the giving of the requisite notice to defendant. The court held that: (1) under 1969 Ala. Acts 698(4)(a) no prosecution could have been commenced without prior written notice to defendant; (2) the evidence showed that the films were not exhibited after the notice was given; and (3) the constitutionally acceptable construction of 1969 Ala. Acts 698 was that the subsequent showing of the same film or films after receiving notice had to form the basis for a criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction by the trial court (Alabama) for possession of one cigarette of marijuana that was discovered after he was stopped and frisked by a police officer pursuant to An Act Relating to the Temporary Questioning of Persons in Public Places and Search for Weapons, by Any Lawful Officer, Aug. 19, 1966, 1966 Ala. Acts p. 183.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police observed defendant out walking late at night, asked him for identification, and found his explanation for being out so late to be unsatisfactory. Defendant was searched and a marijuana cigarette was discovered on his person. He was convicted of violation of Ala. Code tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 256-258 and sentenced to four years in prison. In reversing defendant's conviction, the court held that the marijuana cigarette had to be excluded from evidence and that without it the State failed to carry its burden of proof. Police had no reasonable cause to believe that defendant had committed any crime; therefore, the arrest and seizure of the evidence was pursuant to the Act. Under Ala. Const. &sect; 45, the title of the Act limited its scope, and the body of the Act could not enlarge that meaning. Moreover, under the U.S. Constitution, police authority to make a search without probable cause was limited to a frisk directed at discovery of weapons and not evidence in general. Therefore, police could not continue rummaging about defendant's person after it was clear that he did not pose a danger.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the matter for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 17 years old at the time of entering his guilty plea. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in sustaining the State's demurrer to defendant's plea of misnomer and in overruling defendant's motion to quash the indictment for failure to aver that the property allegedly stolen was the personal property of the owner. Defendant also challenged the trial court's denial of his motion for a new trial based upon the Youthful Offender Act, 1972 Ala. Acts 335. The trial court held that the Act was unconstitutional because it contained no standards for its equal application to all those it affected and because of its provisions requiring the waiver of a jury trial. The court found no error with respect to the trial court's rulings on the State's demurrer and defendant's plea of misnomer, but reversed the trial court's ruling that the Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the Act was constitutional on its face despite the legislature's failure to spell out guidelines or standards for its application. The court also noted that the Act's provisions regarding an accused's waiver of his right to jury trial required the accused's consent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney issued a warrant for defendant's arrest after an alleged rape victim picked his photograph from those of a number of other men. A police officer went to a hospital to arrest defendant. While defendant was changing from his hospital garb into street clothes, he reached into a bag to take out undergarments. The officer stopped him from going into the bag and then searched it. He found the knife, which was later introduced in evidence through the alleged victim's testimony as being the one defendant used when he raped her. The court held that warrants issued by prosecuting attorneys were infirm because the inferences from the facts leading to the complaint were not drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate. Thus, the writ of arrest was wrongly issued. The court held, however, that the arrest was valid because the requisites for a felony arrest without a warrant were met. The officer knew the alleged victim had picked defendant from a number of mug shots and he knew that she had made a complaint of rape. As a citizen, the officer could arrest for a felony. His right to search the bag while making the arrest flowed from his right to make a citizen's arrest.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed his conviction but modified his sentence to life imprisonment. Under Ala. Code tit. 15, &sect;&sect; 343-356, (1940), there was but one lawful place for defendant's execution, and that was dismantled. Defendant essentially was compelled to await a legislative enactment for a determination of the time and place of his execution. The court declared that this wait was cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Although the death penalty was not in itself cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, execution was required to be swift and infliction of unnecessary suffering was unconstitutional. Further, the court found that the legislature's action was such that any renewal of capital punishment would constitute an ex post facto law. As the date of defendant's execution had passed, new resentencing would be de novo. The court rejected defendant's assertion that plain error was committed at trial pursuant to &sect; 10 of the Automatic Appeal Act of 1943, and found that no errors resulting in prejudice had occurred at trial.</SPAN></P>

A fine of $ 50 was imposed as punishment. The trial court denied defendant's motion to quash the complaint and overruled defendant's demurrer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint alleged that defendant disturbed the peace of others by profane language, using the expression &quot;God damn,&quot; in violation of &sect; 16-2, when he yelled at police over a loudspeaker in front of 40 or 50 spectators. Defendant argued that the evidence failed to show that a disorder occurred or that anything he said caused a breach of the peace. On appeal, the court affirmed. The ordinance followed the language of Ala. Code tit. 14, &sect; 119(1) (1940), which was not unconstitutional as a deprivation of free speech. The court held that &sect; 16-2 of the ordinance was not so vague and uncertain as to be violative of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that the language was spoken in circumstances that threatened a breach of the peace. According to the precedents, to constitute profanity defendant must have imprecated divine vengeance upon an individual and that while the expression &quot;God damn you&quot; was considered profanity, &quot;God damn it&quot; was not.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged a Mobile Probate Court (Alabama) judgment denying his contest to the adoption, by the appellee, of appellant's child born out of wedlock.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the Putative Father Registry Act (the Act), Ala. Code &sect; 26-10C-1 et seq., on several bases. Appellant lacked standing to challenge the act for not affording putative fathers notice and an opportunity to be heard in adoption proceedings because, in spite of his noncompliance with the act, appellant had actual notice of the instant proceeding and appeared and testified. Because he had not established a substantial relationship with the child, appellant did not qualify for due process protection. In addition, the Act did meet due process requirements if a putative father timely filed a notice of intent to claim paternity. The treatment of fathers who had registered under the act differently from those who had not was rationally related, under equal protection analysis, to a legitimate government interest. The Act could be reconciled with the state's adoption code. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the probate court was affirmed. Appellant lacked standing to challenge legislation concerning rights of putative fathers on a due process basis, and did not qualify for due process protection because of a lack of a substantial relationship with child. The legislation did not violate equal protection guarantees and was reconcilable with the state's adoption code.</SPAN></P>

Appellant employer argued that the trial court erred in refusing to allow it to deduct the temporary total disability benefits previously paid to its worker from the death benefits it was required to pay to appellee widow.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of revenue sought review of the decision from the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), ruling that 1997 Ala. Acts 301, &sect; 3 violated the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV by attempting to close a loophole in Alabama use tax law for all open tax years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a series of administrative law decisions, a loophole existed in the sales and use tax statutes that permitted out-of-state vendors with no nexus in Alabama to deliver goods to state residents with no tax due on such transactions. As a result of those decisions, the Alabama legislature passed a state law, 1997 Ala. Acts 301, &sect; 3, which closed the loophole retroactively for all open tax years. The circuit court found that the retroactive application of the statute violated the Due Process Clauses of the Alabama and U.S. Constitutions. The court reversed, finding the retroactive period was not excessive and did not result in a denial of due process. The court found that the legislation was supported by a legitimate legislative purpose, furthered by rational means, and the period of retroactivity was modest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision and held that the retroactive period in the legislation attempting to close the use tax loophole was not excessive and therefore did not constitute a denial of due process. The legislation was supported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by rational means, and the period of retroactivity was modest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and his sons believed that a Social Security number was against their religious beliefs. Each applied for a vehicle learner's license. The sons refused to execute a copy of a form which recognized a de facto exception to the Social-Security-number requirement for people wishing to obtain vehicle licenses but who did not have Social Security numbers for religious reasons. A decision denying a constitutional challenge to Ala. Admin. Code r. 760-X-1-.19 was affirmed. Appellee state department of public safety could require any individual who was affected by state licensing laws to furnish his Social Security number. Practically every citizen obtained a Social Security number pursuant to federal law. Appellee was responsible for enforcing laws regarding motor vehicle driver's licenses. Identifying applicants with bad driving records, distinguishing between drivers having the same name, and maintaining eligibility for federal welfare grants were legitimate state goals. Appellee's regulation was a reasonable means of achieving those goals. The class of drivers affected by the law was not a suspect class and the possession of a driver's license was not a fundamental right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, fire department and city, appealed a judgment in favor of plaintiff firefighter rendered by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which found that plaintiff was unable to perform the job duties of a firefighter and was totally disabled under the Trinity Act, 1962 Ala. Acts 26. Defendants challenged the award of benefits to plaintiff and the constitutionality of the Trinity Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff firefighter filed a lawsuit against defendants, fire department and city, for workers' compensation benefits and benefits under the Trinity Act, 1962 Ala. Acts 26. In 1995, plaintiff was struck around the head and neck by falling debris while fighting a fire. He went to a doctor two days later and was diagnosed with two ruptured cervical discs. After surgery, he was placed on light duty, but still complained of numbness and pain. A functional capacity evaluation revealed plaintiff had problems with overhead lifting. He continued to work in a light-duty capacity only. The trial court entered a judgment finding that plaintiff sustained a compensable neck injury with a 12 percent permanent partial impairment and a 12 percent loss of earning capacity. It found that plaintiff was unable to perform his duties as a firefighter and awarded benefits under the Trinity Act. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and concluded that the trial court correctly determined plaintiff's disability. Because defendant did not serve the attorney general with mandatory notice, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 6-6-227, the court had no jurisdiction to decide the constitutionality of the Trinity Act.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff firefighter sustained an injury to his neck while working for defendants, fire department and city. He was diagnosed with two ruptured cervical discs and had surgery, never returning to full duty. The trial court correctly determined that plaintiff was totally disabled under the Trinity Act. Its constitutionality was not decided because notice was not served on the attorney general.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Morgan County Department of Human Resources allocated a pro rata share of the child support it received from appellee father to appellee mother and to the mother of the father's other child, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 38-10-8 (1975). The Morgan District Court (Alabama) held that &sect; 38-10-8 was unconstitutional. The department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father had three children by two different mothers. As the money withheld from his pay under an income withholding order was insufficient to satisfy the total child support due under separate court orders, the department allocated 70 percent to appellee mother and 30 percent to the other mother. The trial court held, sua sponte, that &sect; 38-10-8, which authorized this procedure, was unconstitutional. The appellate court disagreed. The statute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine by impermissibly delegating legislative or judicial powers, because it contained reasonably clear standards governing execution and administration of the income withholding provisions of the Child Support Act, nor did the statute violate appellee mother's rights under the Due Process Clause. While both mothers had a property interest in having their child support paid in full, neither had a claim of entitlement to have her support paid in full before the other's was paid. Further, Alabama had an interest in seeing that each child for whom support had been ordered received at least a portion of that support every month.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 26-17-6(a), and that the mother's ex-husband was the presumed father of the minor child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the mother divorced her ex-husband, the divorce decree incorporated an agreement, which stated that although two children were born during the marriage, the ex-husband was not the natural father of either child. The state, on behalf of the child, sought an adjudication of paternity and child support against the alleged father. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the alleged father. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the child had a presumed father, the ex-husband, and that the paternity action against the alleged father was barred by the five-year statute of limitations. The child was not a party to the divorce action nor was he represented by a guardian ad litem in the divorce proceeding. Thus, the child was entitled to a presumption of paternity. Neither the state nor the guardian ad litem filed an action, on behalf of the child, to establish paternity or to rebut the presumption of paternity before the child's fifth birthday. A paternity adjudication in a divorce action, which was necessary for purposes of support and inheritance, was res judicata to the parties in the divorce action, but did not bind the child unless the child was a party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, representatives of four subclasses of aggrieved persons, sought review of a judgment from Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted summary judgment to defendants, governor and state commissioner of revenue. The representatives sought a declaratory judgment ordering that Alabama's classification of retirement benefits for state income tax purposes was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representatives filed a claim alleging that Alabama's classification of retirement benefits for state income tax purposes violated the Ala. Const. amend. 25 (1901) and their rights to equal protection under Ala. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 6, 22 and U.S. Const. amend. 14, &sect; 1. The trial court granted summary judgment against the representatives and they appealed. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the pre-1991 and post-1991 classification of retirement benefits for Alabama income tax purposes did not violate the provisions of amend. 25 because Ala. Const. amend. 61 repealed the prohibitions of amend. 25. The court then reviewed each of the subclasses' claims for alleged violations of equal protection. The court found that there was a rational basis related to the difference in the state's income tax of government retirement benefits, as opposed to other types of retirement benefits, to attract qualified persons to government service. A similar rational basis was found regarding two other subclasses. The court also held that there was a legitimate state goal of equal treatment between state employees and those private citizens receiving comparable retirement benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alleged that appellee employer had breached a contract of employment with him and denied him the due process of law guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. The court stated that the evidence established the first two elements of the test for an offer of permanent employment. Appellees' motions for summary judgment did not challenge, and appellees made no showing questioning the existence of, the third element: whether the associate dean had the authority to bind appellee employer. Thus, the summary judgment was reversed insofar as it disposed of the claim relating to the dean's offer, and on remand, the question of dean's authority was an open issue. Also, the summary judgment was reversed with respect to the issue whether the staff handbook constituted an offer to appellant of a contract of employment that could have been terminated only for cause. Because the trial court ruled incorrectly on the contract issue, it also ruled incorrectly on the due process issue. The court found that appellant's lawsuit for money damages for breach of contract came within the prohibition of Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 (1901), the sovereign immunity provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment insofar as struck portions of appellant's complaint and denied his petition for a writ of mandamus. The grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees was reversed and remanded the cause for further proceedings insofar as it disposed of the claim relating to the dean's offer and certain due process issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City permitted the business owners to erect a sign on their establishment, which was located in an historic district.

They then commenced an action alleging that the sign ordinance, Mobile, Ala., Zoning Ordinance 80-507, was unconstitutional. The circuit court found that a portion of the ordinance was unconstitutional. It also denied the City's motion for reconsideration. On appeal, the court found that that the sign ordinance was impermissibly vague and ambiguous. Mobile Ala., Zoning Ordinance 80-507 &sect; 4(7) required the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for each sign located within an historic district. It also stated that all conforming signs would be permitted. However, Mobile, Ala., Zoning Ordinance 80-507, by itself, did not specify those guidelines. Furthermore, &quot;sign design guidelines&quot; that were subsequently adopted failed to define many of their terms.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother's trial court action was transferred to the juvenile court for a paternity determination. The juvenile court adjudged the alleged father to be the father, and he appealed to the circuit court for a trial de novo. After further testing showed that he was not the father, the alleged father filed a counterclaim, asserting claims under the Alabama Uniform Parentage Act and the Alabama Litigation Accountability Act, and for quantum meruit relief and fraud. The trial court entered a partial judgment finding that the alleged father was not the father. The trial court subsequently granted summary judgment in favor of the alleged father on his counterclaim. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court judgment in favor of the alleged father in all respects. In light of the evidence, the court could not conclude that the trial court's findings were plainly and palpably wrong. The trial de novo displaced the decision in the juvenile court, and therefore, the alleged father was entitled to recover the support and medical expenses that he previously had paid on behalf of the child.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the jury rendered a verdict awarding plaintiff insured compensatory and punitive damages on his claim for fraudulent or malicious misrepresentation and deceit, the Lowndes Circuit Court (Alabama) granted defendant insurer's motion for a new trial. The insurer appealed the denial of its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or remittitur; the insured cross-appealed the decision to grant a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To succeed on her fraud claim, the insured was required to show that the insurer misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact, either willfully or recklessly without knowledge, that the insured relied on the misrepresentation, and that she incurred damages as a result. Because of the differences in the knowledge between the insurance agent and the insured, the jury could have inferred the agent either misrepresented or suppressed material facts about the insurance policy, and that the insured had relied on them. Thus, there were sufficient facts to send the case to the jury. The court also found the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the insurer had deliberately suppressed the coverage under the policy. Thus, punitive damages were proper. Since the amount of punitive damages equaled the amount of compensatory damages, they were found not to be excessive. The statute of limitations did not bar the suit because limitations did not begin to run until the fraud was discovered. On the cross-appeal, the court found no justification for ordering a new trial. It was improper for the trial court to consider race in determining probable prejudice in a juror.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision granting a new trial and remanded the matter for an entry of a judgment consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parties' divorce, appellant father sued appellees, the mother and another man, in the Lauderdale Circuit Court (Alabama) to establish the paternity of one of the couple's children. The father also petitioned for a change of custody of the couple's children. The mother moved for a summary judgment. The other man moved to dismiss. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. The father appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father sought to have blood testing of one of the couple's children. The father alleged that during the course of his marriage to the mother the mother had an affair with the other man, which the father did not learn of until after the divorce. The mother argued that the father's claim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata based on the determination of paternity during the divorce. The trial court determined that paternity had been established in the divorce judgment entered in the case and that the issue was res judicata and could not be reopened. On appeal, the court found that the facts did not indicate circumstances so extraordinary and compelling as to justify relief under Ala. Code &sect; 26-17A-1 (1975). Nowhere in the record did the mother ever admit that the father was not the father of the child.; blood tests were not conducted; and the father did not submit any affidavits or other evidence to support the allegations in his petition. Although the trial court's dismissal based on the doctrine of res judicata was improper, the court properly denied the father's request for DNA testing to establish paternity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee appealed the judgment from the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which affirmed the decision of defendants, State Personnel Board (Alabama) and State Department of Corrections (Alabama), to terminate the employee and upheld the constitutionality of the department's administrative regulations, under which the employee was discharged following a random drug test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee claimed that the department's regulation for random drug testing was invalid because it did not comply with the Alabama Administrative Procedure Act (AAPA), Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 41-22-5, -6 (1975). The court held that the regulation was not subject to the AAPA, as it strictly involved internal personnel practices and had no appreciable effect on the public. The employee also disputed admission of his drug test, claiming the department failed to show a complete chain of custody of his urine sample. The court found that the evidence was admissible, and the department adequately established the scientific reliability of the drug testing. Nevertheless, the court reversed the circuit court's decision, because a hearing officer of the board had concluded that, as a matter of law, unintentional ingestion was not a defense to the charge, but the hearing officer made no factual finding with respect to the credibility of the employee's defense. The court, therefore, could not determine what weight and credibility the hearing officer would have accorded to a defense if it had been considered. Thus, the action was remanded to the board for additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision upholding the employee's dismissal from work, and it remanded the case to the board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was struck by a municipal garbage truck while employed for the municipality, which caused serious injuries and ultimately, his demise. The fund paid the decedent's medical expenses pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-77(a) (1975). The administratrix had filed a third-party action for wrongful death against various tortfeasors who had manufactured, distributed, and sold the garbage truck. The fund had intervened based on its subrogation claim for the medical benefits that had been paid, but it was dismissed from the action. The fund appealed and the court reversed the summary judgment of dismissal, holding that the fund had a right to intervene in order to seek subrogation. An analysis of Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-11(a) revealed that it withstood challenges to its constitutionality. There was no equal protection violation because the classes of those who had to submit to subrogation and those who did not was not a product of statutory classification. Further, that the right to a jury determination of the damages was not infringed by the subrogation claim. The statute did not violate due process in that it was not overly broad. The court remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's summary judgment of dismissal of the fund in its subrogation claim in the administratrix's action against the tortfeasors.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father appealed an order of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which in the father's action against defendant pursuant to the Alabama seduction statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 6-5-351 (1975), entered judgment in favor of defendant on the ground that &sect; 6-5-351 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court noted that &sect; 6-5-351 created a gender-based classification in that only males could be liable under the statute. To withstand a constitutional challenge, that gender-based classification was required to serve an important governmental objective and be substantially related to the achievement of that objective. The court observed that several Alabama statutes that merely preserved old notions of law and were no longer supported by reason had been struck down. The court reviewed the common law basis for the seduction statute, noting that at common law there was a presumption that a child was in the service of the parent while in the family, and that a civil cause of action for seduction was recognized in favor of the father based on the quasi-fictitious master-servant standing. The statute modified the common law cause of action to vindicate the outrage felt by parents whose daughter's virtue had been ruined. The court concluded that the statute was not substantially related to the governmental interest of redressing wrongful conduct, noting that the gender-based limitations of the statute ignored the same outrage felt by parents of a daughter seduced by a woman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a workers' compensation benefits claimant, appealed a decision by the Clay Circuit Court (Alabama), which found that the claimant had voluntarily left his job with defendant employer and that the claimant had moved out-of-state, where he earned at least $ 100 more per week than he had earned with the employer. The claimant contended that his injury while working for the employer left him permanently disabled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the claimant was not a permanent total disability candidate. The claimant had surgery three months after his accident. Two months later, he voluntarily left his job with the employer and moved out-of-state, where he saw another physician, who assigned him a 10 percent physical impairment rating. The claimant then got a job with a railroad, but he suffered a stroke that left him unable to work. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's determination. Under the Alabama Workers' Compensation Act, the court's standard of review was if there was substantial evidence to support the finding. The court found that Ala. Code &sect; 25-5-57(a)(3)i was applicable because it addressed return to work at a wage greater than or equal to the claimant's pre-injury wage. Because there was such a return to work in the claimant's case, the trial court properly refused to consider evidence of the claimant's vocational disability. Although the court sympathized with the claimant's condition, the court refused to require the employer to shoulder any financial burden beyond that which was caused by the injury suffered by the claimant while working for the employer.</SPAN></P>

The father moved for an order requiring a blood test to determine paternity, alleging that he had received information that at the time of the conception the mother was engaged in a sexual relationship with another male. The litigant obtained private DNA testing that excluded him as the biological father. The trial court ordered additional testing that confirmed the prior testing. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the litigant did not doubt his paternity until he discovered 10 years later that the mother had had sexual relations with another man during the time of conception; (2) the litigant did not have reason to request a blood test at the time of the paternity adjudication; and (3) the father presented the court with scientific evidence indicating he was not the father pursuant to &sect; 26-17A-1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporation, which was outside the municipality's corporate limits but inside its police jurisdiction, filed an action seeking refund of license taxes paid under protest and sought a declaration of its rights and responsibilities under Ala. Code &sect; 11-51-91 and Act. No. 86-427. The municipality counterclaimed contended that it was not required to respond to any police or fine calls within fire districts located inside its police jurisdiction. The court reversed in part the circuit court's judgment and concluded that the Legislature's intent at the time it enacted &sect; 2 of Act No. 86-427 was to relieve businesses such the corporation that were simultaneously located within a fire district and a police jurisdiction from the duty to pay two authorities in advance for fire protection, and not to establish two conflicting rules for calculating license taxes in different parts of the same police jurisdiction. As such, the court concluded that the corporation was entitled to refunds from the city of those license taxes the corporation had paid under protest since 1992.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county brought a complaint against the junkyard alleging that the property contained inoperable motor vehicles, used motor vehicle tires, junk, debris, or salvaged material prohibited and declared to be a public nuisance by said 1994 Ala. Act 671 (Act). The lower court entered judgment in favor of the county. Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the facts stated that the junkyard was in control of the premises in the county, which contained junkyard items. The court found that the Act was enacted to regulate the accumulation and storage of junk, inoperable motor vehicles, and other litter within the unincorporated area of the county. The court found therefore that a person of common intelligence would know the Act would have adequate notice that a business like the junkyard was required to obtain a junkyard license applied to the junkyard. Therefore, the Act was not unconstitutionally vague. The act did not attempt to regulate the use of buildings or to prohibit the operation of a junkyard in any particular area of the county and was therefore not a zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff instructors challenged a judgment from the Dale Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted the summary judgment motions of defendants, a community college and its president. The instructors had filed actions under the Fair Dismissal Act (Act), Ala. Code &sect; 36-26-100 et seq. (1975), for declaratory judgments and writs of mandamus directing the college to recognize them as tenured employees and to issue them full-time employment contracts.</SPAN></P>

The college reduced the instructors' course load, and they sought declaratory relief and a mandamus alleging that they were partially terminated and were protected therefrom under the Act, and directing the college to recognize them as tenured employees and to issue them full-time contracts of employment. On appeal from the trial court's summary judgment for the college and the president, the court affirmed the judgment and held that: (1) the holding that the claims were precluded by the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies was harmless error because the instructors were not entitled to the relief sought; (2) the Act provided a dismissal procedure for non-teachers and hence, did not apply to instructional personnel; (3) hence, the instructors could claim no right of tenure under the Act; and (4) they failed to meet the three consecutive-year probationary period for tenure.</SPAN></P>

P. 60(b). Appellant State Department of Human Resources intervened and opposed the husband's petition. The State obtained a writ of mandamus that the divorce judgment was res judicata regarding the husband's paternity. The Lee Circuit Court (Alabama) later granted the husband's renewed Rule 60(b) petition and the State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband filed a Rule 60(b) petition on the ground that his former wife had told him he was not the father of a child for whom the divorce judgment required him to pay child support. The State ultimately obtained a writ of mandamus declaring that the divorce judgment was res judicata with regard to the paternity issue. The husband filed a renewed Rule 60(b) motion which the trial court granted. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in relying on Ala. Code &sect; 26-17A-1 to set aside the prior judgment determining paternity. The court found that the divorce judgment constituted a judicial determination of paternity to which &sect; 26-17A-1 applied. The court noted that subsequent blood tests indicated that the husband was not the child's father and that another individual was the child's father. The court further noted that the child acknowledged the other individual's paternity. The court held that the father's nine-year delay in bringing the Rule 60(b) motion was not unreasonable because he was not aware that there was any question as to his paternity until that time.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the mother's wrongful act did not alter the father's duty to provide support for the child. The court found that the child's interests and welfare were paramount under the Alabama Uniform Parentage Act. The court did not address the father's contention that Ala.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dogs trained to sniff for firearms and drugs were brought to a high school. One of the dogs &quot;hit&quot; on a car registered to the student. She was summoned from class. The student told the officer that there possibly could be a gun under the front seat. Police searched the car and found a handgun under the driver's seat. The student contended that her mother had left the gun in the car after she had driven it the night before and that she did not know that the gun was in the car when she drove to school. The Board decided to expel the student for eight weeks. On appeal from the permanent injunction, the court held that while the student's punishment might seem harsh, to allow the juvenile court to reverse the Board's decision and permanently enjoin the board from expelling the student undermined the Board's policy and state law banning weapons on school campuses. The court determined that because it could not say that there was a shocking disparity between the offense and the punishment imposed, the juvenile court abused its discretion in entering the injunction.</SPAN></P>

The detective then sought review by certiorari to the circuit court alleging that the action was not supported by sufficient evidence and that 1971 Ala. Acts 71-2280 was unconstitutional and denied him the equal protection of the law in violation of the United States and Alabama Constitutions. Act No 71-2280 provided that the findings and order of the Personnel Board shall be final and conclusive and shall not be reviewable in any court. The circuit court dismissed the detective's petition, holding that Act No. 711-2280 prevented him from seeking review of the Board's decision. The circuit court did note however that it did review the record and that the Board's decision was supported by substantial evidence. The court held that the circuit court properly dismissed the detective's claim that Act No. 71-2280 was unconstitutional, because the detective failed to notify the Attorney General of the pendency of the claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant owned a half interest in the surface rights of three parcels of property and various interests in the mineral rights. He alleged that the property could not be equitably divided or partitioned in kind and requested that the property be sold. He further requested that he be allowed to purchase the interest of the co-tenants, and he asked the trial court to appoint an appraiser to determine the value of the their interest. The trial court granted the tenant's request for a default judgment. The co-tenant's motion to set aside the default judgment was then denied by the trial court. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that in order to set aside the default judgment, the co-tenants were required to present a meritorious defense that was supported by a factual basis showing that the outcome of the case could have been different if it had been disposed of by a trial on the merits. The court noted that the only issue precluded by the default judgment was whether the land could have been equitably partitioned. The co-tenants presented no evidence to establish a factual basis that the land could have been equitably divided.</SPAN></P>

Appellants were challenging the constitutionality of Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 40-23-36 and 40-23-77 (1975) and discounts that were allowed to certain retailers on sales and use taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 40-23-36 and 40-23-77, the department allowed discounts to retailers for collecting and timely remitting certain sales and use taxes. The taxpayer and the town brought a class action against appellees and alleged that the discounts were unlawful disbursements of state funds by state officers. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellees. The court entered an initial judgment but on rehearing, it determined that the taxpayer lacked standing in the action because there was no unlawful expenditure of funds. The court explained that the discounts were merely payments for services rendered in the collection and remission of taxes. The court found that the town lacked standing with regard to the sales tax issue under Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-36, since the town had requested the department's assistance in collecting the town's sales tax. The court explained that the town could have collected its own sales taxes. The court found that the town had standing to challenge the use tax discount under Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-77, as the discounts were mandatory under that statute, but that it was unconstitutional to allow discounts as compensation to the retailers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee appealed from the Shelby Circuit Court (Alabama), which entered summary judgment in favor of defendant sheriff's deputies in the arrestee's action alleging false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, and a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for violation of her civil rights. The circuit court granted the deputies' motion for summary judgment on the grounds that they were immune from liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff alleged that she had been improperly arrested by one of the deputies on a warrant that she had previously explained to him was directed at another person. She also asserted that she had complained to another deputy about the previous attempt to arrest her. It was only after plaintiff was charged with a similar offense that the first deputy decided to arrest her on the earlier warrant. The court considered plaintiff's state law claims and noted that state officers and employees, in their official and individual capacities, were absolutely immune from suit when the action was, in effect, one against the State. The court found that the only exceptions to the immunity of sheriffs' deputies were those specified in Ala. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14 and that none of those applied. The court also held that U.S. Const. amend. XI barred any action under &sect; 1983 against a deputy acting in his official capacity. Although this immunity did not apply to claims against the deputies in their individual capacities, the court found that they were entitled to qualified immunity with respect to such claims in that they were acting within their discretionary authority when they arrested plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the department's appeal because the trial court did not have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal from the assessment as the taxpayer failed to properly perfect his appeal of the department's assessments. The judgment entered by the trial court with no jurisdiction was a void judgment, and a void judgment would not support an appeal. Further, on cross-appeal, the court determined that the substances excise tax did not violate the double jeopardy clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed a complaint, alleging that the father was the biological father of her minor child. The father initially denied paternity, but signed an affidavit acknowledging paternity after he was ordered to pay the cost of a blood test. When the mother later sought to modify the support order, the father counterclaimed, arguing that he was not the father. The trial court ordered blood tests, which revealed that he was not the father. The trial court then set aside the paternity order and the court affirmed. It found that the statute allowing the reopening of a paternity case was not unconstitutionally vague. Further, the paternity case was properly reopened without the initial presentation of scientific evidence that the father was not the child's biological father, as the father was asserting non-paternity as a defense to the mother's petition to modify support and the trial court was entitled to order blood tests and reconsider the issue of paternity after the tests were conducted. Finally, the court found that it was not an abuse of discretion to hold that the motion for relief under Ala. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) was timely made 11 years after the adjudication of paternity.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 40-17A-1 through 40-17A-16 (1975), on marijuana seized during the dealer's arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealer's guilty plea to being a youthful offender was set aside and charges against him for possession of marijuana were dismissed with prejudice after he was granted youthful offender status and successfully completed a treatment program. The dealer contended on appeal that the Alabama Controlled Substance Excise Tax imposed under the Act was arbitrary and irrational and therefore unconstitutional as applied to him, that the tax violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition against excessive fines, and that application of the tax violated his constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the dealer had not shown Ala. Code &sect; 40-17A-1(3) (1975) to be unconstitutional. The court held that because Alabama's drug tax served a solely remedial purpose, the Eighth Amendment did not apply to assessments based on that tax.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1992 and 1993, the court and the Alabama Supreme Court refused to allow the trial court to grant the father, who had been declared the legal father of a minor child, Ala.

The trial court made the child a party to the action and appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) for the minor child. The GAL challenged the constitutionality of the act. The trial court found that the act was unconstitutional. The father appealed and the state cross-appealed on the issue of retrospective application of the act. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and held that: (1) the trial court erred in holding that the act violated the equal protection guaranteed to Alabama citizens by the Alabama Constitution of 1901; (2) it was clear from the plain reading of the act that it was intended to be applied retroactively; and (3) the act did not violate public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wife appealed from a judgment entered by the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which awarded the parties a divorce and prohibited the parties from ever marrying again. Plaintiff husband filed a cross-appeal with regard to the property distribution and the award of periodic alimony to the wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband filed a complaint seeking a divorce from the wife. The trial court divorced the parties and divided their marital property. The wife was awarded custody of the parties' child. The husband was required to pay child support and alimony. The trial court's order also specified that the parties were to never marry again. The trial court denied the wife's post-judgment motion. Cross-appeals were filed by the parties. The trial court's judgment was affirmed except with regard to the prohibition against remarriage. That portion was reversed. The matter was remanded for the entry of an order that conformed to the court's opinion.  Ala. Code &sect; 30-2-8 (1975) permitted a trial court to prohibit a party from marrying again. The court found that &sect; 30-2-8, when narrowly applied, was a permissible exercise of the state's power to regulate marriage and, therefore, refused to declare that provision unconstitutional. However, the record did not contain evidence that would justify prohibiting the parties from marrying again. The court found no abuse of the trial court's discretion with regard to either the property distribution or the amounts awarded as child support and alimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment except with regard to its prohibition against remarriage. That portion was reversed and the matter was remanded for the entry of an order that was consistent with the court's opinion. The wife's request for an attorney fee was granted in the amount of $ 2,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed actions alleging that the merchants' collection of sales tax on fertilizers, insecticides, and herbicides violated Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-4. A few months later, 1992 Ala. Acts 92-343 (Act) was passed. The Act retroactively amended Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-4 and stated that fertilizers and insecticides were not exempt from sales tax except when used for agricultural purposes. After the Act was passed, both the merchants and the taxpayers filed summary judgment motions. The trial court denied the taxpayers' summary judgment motion and granted the merchants' summary judgment motion. The court affirmed the trial court's order, holding that (1) the trial court properly ruled that no factual dispute existed and that the merchants were entitled to a judgment as a matter of law; (2) the Alabama Constitution did not prohibit the enactment of retroactive legislation; and (3) the Act's title was not misleading in violation of Ala. Const. art. IV, &sect; 45 because the phrase &quot;to provide further&quot; could be used to explain limitations placed by amendments and &sect; 45 required only that the average person reading the title would be informed of the Act's purpose.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 40-23-1 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 2 of 1992 Ala. Acts 92-343 (Act) amended Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-1 (1975) to clarify that the State of Alabama could collect sales tax on the full purchase price of products that might contain consumer excise taxes. The taxpayers alleged that the Act was unconstitutional in that it violated separation of power principles, it was applied retroactively, and it had a defective title. In affirming the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to the Department, the court ruled that the Act was not proven unconstitutional. The Act was not an encroachment on the power of the judiciary because the legislature was not directing the judiciary how to interpret the sales and use tax statutes. The legislature's power was plenary, and retroactive application of revenue statutes was a common legislative practice that was not unconstitutional. The taxpayers did not have standing to argue that the Act violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws because that prohibition applied only to criminal matters. Finally, the Act did not have a constitutionally defective title.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed a claim for workmen's compensation benefits. The employer contested the claim on the basis that the injury was not work-related.

The trial court granted summary judgment to the employer and dismissed the estate's claim for benefits that accrued from the time of the injury to the date of the employee's death, finding that the &quot;death following disability clause, &quot; of the Act, codified at &sect; 25-5-57(a)(5), denied any benefits to the estate. The estate appealed and the court affirmed, finding that the estate was not entitled to receive any benefits on behalf of the deceased employee because his death was not proximately caused by the alleged work-related injury and at the time of the employee's death there had been no determination of the degree of his disability, either by agreement of the parties or by judicial order.

At trial, the testimony established that the air gun in question was unloaded and that no ammunition for it was found in the student's car or on his person. Moreover, the police officer who investigated the incident testified that the unloaded air gun could not have been fired as a weapon. The court affirmed. The court found that the applicable section of the student code of conduct did not give proper notice about what conduct could be an offense. The court determined that the section was ambiguous and vague and therefore failed constitutional muster. The court also found that the board denied the student due process when it substituted for its own independent judgment for that of the principal of the school.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department notified the facility of its intent to revoke the license because of their consistent failure to maintain standards prescribed by the department. After a pre-revocation hearing, the hearing officer entered an order revoking the facility's license. On appeal, the facility maintained that the decision to revoke its license was arbitrary, capricious, and unsupported by the evidence. The court held that the facility's prior failures to meet department standards were admissible because they tended to show that the facility had knowledge of the prescribed standards, yet engaged in the routine practice of ignoring those standards. Evidence of the facility's prelicense deficiencies was admissible to show that the facility had specific notice of its deviation from minimum standards. A review of the evidence in its entirety revealed that there was substantial legal evidence to support the factual conclusions upon which the facility's license was revoked. The court thoroughly reviewed the record and concluded that the evidence supported the hearing officer's findings of fact and conclusions of law. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department filed an action against the putative father, who was determined to be the father of the child, and he began paying child support. Seven years later, the putative father requested blood tests, which excluded him from being the child's father. The Department appealed. The putative father subsequently counterclaimed, requesting that all child support payments that he had made should be returned to him. He also sought damages. The circuit court granted a directed verdict in favor of the putative father. His counterclaim was ordered severed, and it was set for a later date. The court affirmed. The Department's motion to dismiss was denied. It subsequently filed a petition for writ of mandamus. The court denied the writ. The court noted that the circuit court found that the counterclaim stated a cause of action and that the Department was not constitutionally immune because the original proceeding was filed in the name of the State, was prosecuted by the State, and the State acted as a collection agency for the support payments. The court found no abuse of discretion and held that the Department failed to demonstrate a clear, legal right to the order that it sought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Commissioner of Revenue (commissioner) and other state officials, challenged the order of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which awarded partial summary judgment to appellee truck drivers association in the association's class action that challenged the constitutionality of the marker tax, Ala. Code &sect; 40-17-150 (1975), which was imposed on foreign motor vehicles, and awarded refunds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the enactment of the marker tax, the commissioner collected the taxes. The association brought a class action that alleged the marker tax was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. The circuit court certified the class, granted partial judgment to the association on the issue of liability, found the marker tax violated the Commerce Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, enjoined the commissioner from collection of the marker tax, and awarded a refund that was placed in escrow. Appellants sought review, but the court affirmed. The court found it was undisputed that the marker tax cost foreign carriers six times more than domestic carriers. This violated the Commerce Clause. The class action was properly certified because the class had several thousand members with a common challenge and the representatives' claims were typical. Sovereign immunity was not a bar to the class action because a class action was a proper remedy for illegally collected taxes. Under Ala. Code &sect; 40-1-12 (1975), the circuit court had properly placed the refund proceeds in an escrow account pending the appeal.</SPAN></P>

In September 1993 defendant pleaded guilty to a federal charge of distribution of marijuana, was sentenced and was fined. Defendant challenged the Department's assessment as violative of double jeopardy. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of the Department because (1) the Act did not impose liability that was fundamentally punitive but was a remedial measure whereby those who had previously escaped taxation were assessed the amount they owed, with the same penalties for nonpayment to which all taxpayers were subject; (2) the Act's remedial purpose far outweighed any punitive effect it had; and (3) the Act imposed no criminal prosecution on a dealer, did not subject a dealer to multiple criminal prosecutions for the same offense, and did not violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff doctor filed an action to challenge a decision of defendant Alabama State Board of Health (board) that the doctor's &quot;private office&quot; was subject to the rules relating to the licensure and certification of abortion or reproductive health centers. The board filed a counterclaim. The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) granted the board's motion for summary judgment. The doctor challenged the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the doctor argued that the trial court erred in finding that the board had the authority to regulate the procedures performed in his private office. The court held that the legislature gave the board the authority to adopt necessary rules and regulations to meet the statutory objectives of Ala. Code &sect; 22-21-28. Adopting the trial court's judgment, the court found that the State of Alabama had the authority to promulgate rules in Chapter 420-5-1 as a part of its legislative plan, as noted in Ala. Code &sect; 22-21-20. Additionally, the court found that Rule 420-5-101(2)(b) was constitutional and a proper exercise of the Alabama's authority to define and regulate a health care provider. The court further found that Alabama had the authority to regulate a profession and that this right did not violate any privacy or property right. In conclusion, the court held that the adoption, application, and enforcement of Rule 420-5-101 by the board pertaining to the performance of the doctor was constitutional and was not contrary to, or in violation of the Ala. Code &sect; 22-21-20.</SPAN></P>

The residents failed to challenge the qualifications of the planning commission members at the hearing, there was no evidence in the record to indicate that any planning commission member was disqualified.

Code &sect; 40-23-60(4)(b) (1975). The trial court ruled that the iodine and chlorine were not exempt from use tax but were to be taxed at the reduced machine rate levied at Ala. Code &sect; 40-23-61(b) (1975). The trial court noted that despite certain amendments to the tax statutes,&nbsp;&sect; 40-23-60(4)(b) was not amended. Accordingly, the established controlling authority still applied, and property was exempt as an ingredient or component only if it was intended to remain and did in fact remained as part of the finished product.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bar owner called police to his bar because of a disturbance. The bar owner sought a warrant for the arrest of a 19 year old. The State of Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board found the bar owner guilty of violating Ala. Code &sect; 28-3A-11 (1975) by allowing minors in the bar and suspended his license. There was no direct testimony that any 19 year olds were inside the bar. The lower court affirmed. On appeal, the bar owner claimed that there was insufficient evidence to support the Board's decision that minors were inside the bar on the night in question. The court agreed. The officer who initially responded did not testify. Further, the court held that under Ala. Code &sect; 28-1-5 (1975), persons between the ages of 19 and 21 years were permitted to enter the bar as long as they did not consume, dispense, or transport alcoholic beverages.The court held that to adopt the Board's interpretation could render Ala. Code &sect; 28-3A-11 (1975)&nbsp;unconstitutional because it would cause discrimination against those persons between the ages of 19 and 21 years. The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant arrestee sought review of a judgment of the Houston Circuit Court (Alabama), which, following an ore tenus proceeding, condemned the arrestee's vehicle based on a request by appellee State of Alabama's request pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-93 (1975), the Drug Profits Forfeiture Act of 1988, and placed title and possession of the vehicle in the sheriff's office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police department had a search warrant for the residence of a suspect. When they were at the suspect's house, the arrestee and the suspect arrived in the arrestee's vehicle. They were asked to identify themselves and when the arrestee opened the vehicle's glove compartment, the deputy saw two bags of marijuana. The arrestee contended on appeal from the condemnation of his vehicle that the forfeiture was predicated upon an illegal search and seizure and that the Drug Profits Forfeiture Act of 1988, Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-93 (1975), violated the equal protection provisions of the United States Constitution and the Alabama Constitution. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the warrantless search and seizure fell within the &quot;plain view&quot; exception. The initial intrusion was lawful, the discovery was inadvertent, and the incriminating nature of the property was immediately apparent. Because the arrestee did not serve the attorney general, as required by Ala. Code &sect; 6-6-227 (1975), the trial court had no jurisdiction to decide the constitutional challenge of the statute. Its judgment with regard to the constitutional issues was void and did not support an appeal to the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant father challenged the judgment of the Mobile Circuit Court(Alabama), which granted plaintiff mother's petition to modify and increase child support and post-minority support in a post-divorce proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced and the mother had custody of the parties' two children. The mother filed a petition to modify support and the trial court granted it. Affirming, court found that the trial court's judgment was supported by the evidence. The court noted that although the financial resources of the parents should be considered, some sacrifice did not mean undue hardship since many parents sacrificed to send their children to college. The court determined that the fact that the amount of post-minority support was the same as the guidelines for child support did not automatically mean that the trial court had erred if it was based on the reasonable and necessary college expenses. The court found that the child's attendance at an out-of-state, non-accredited college did not affect the amount of support the father was ordered to pay. The court concluded that it was bound by the decisions of the Alabama Supreme Court under Ala. Code &sect; 12-3-16 (1975), and since it had found that post-minority support was constitutional, the court could not contradict it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which modified the support obligations of the father.</SPAN></P>
