The employee opposed the intervention on the basis of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-572r(c) of the Product Liability law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured while operating a machine that the employer had purchased from the manufacturer. The purpose of the sought-for intervention was to enable the employer to be reimbursed from any judgment obtained by the employee for amounts it had paid and might become obligated to pay pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act. In response to the employee's opposition, the employer asserted that the employee was hired well before the effective date of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-572r(c). The court held that the employer's right to recover from a third party was derived from the employee, and that the &quot;date of injury rule&quot; determined rights and obligations of parties. The court, therefore, held that intervention by the employer as a co-plaintiff was barred by &sect; 52-572r(c). Alternatively, the employer contended that if &sect; 52-572r(c) precluded intervention, it was unconstitutional because it did not bear a rational relationship to any legitimate purpose for which it was enacted. The court held that the purpose of &sect; 52-572r(c) was a reduction in the number of product liability actions filed, a purpose on which the General Assembly could legitimately act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner of environmental protection filed a five-count complaint against the landowner and associated individuals. The first count of the complaint alleged that the commissioner of environmental protection issued a pollution abatement order to the landowner who failed to comply with the order. The third and fourth counts alleged that the landowner caused water-containing sediment to be discharged in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-447. The landowner and associated individuals filed an answer in which 24 special defenses were asserted. In response, a motion to strike 20 of the special defenses was filed. The major defense alleged by the landowner and associated individuals was that there was no authority to issue the abatement order and any discharge from its property was storm water discharge. The court granted the motion to strike most of the defenses and denied the others. The court stated that the landowner and associated individuals alleged only legal conclusions that the commissioner of environmental protection was without authority to act and that the landowner and associated individuals were not required to plead that the storm water discharge was registered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold two Florida lottery tickets in Connecticut. 1991 Conn. Acts 3, &sect; 134 (Spec.

The court affirmed the conviction. The court found that, but for Congress' enactment of federal laws permitting the states to regulate and criminalize the sale of out-of-state lottery tickets, the law would have discriminated against interstate commerce. Because Congress said the states could regulate the sale of lottery tickets, the law was valid. The court found that &sect; 134 was not preempted by federal law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union, on behalf of the class of state maintenance and service employees, filed an action seeking wages and other damages and expenses. The state filed a motion to dismiss. The court granted the motion as to all counts except the first count for wages and contract claims. The state's protection from suit without its consent through sovereign immunity was not to be diminished unless there appeared in the law the clear intention of the legislature to reduce that protection. However, in cases in which a plaintiff requested only &quot;a judicial declaration of its rights&quot; the doctrine of sovereign immunity did not protect the state. Furthermore, the state was subject to the wage law as an employer and civil actions are allowed against employers pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-72. Thus, the union properly stated this cause of action. The other claims were either not fully exhausted or barred by sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bank filed an action in the court (Connecticut) to recover on a promissory note of which it was the holder. One of defendant general partners, a maker, filed an answer denying the bank's allegations and raising special defenses and counterclaims. The bank moved for summary judgment with documents attached and the general partner objected and filed an affidavit. The areas of law were the merits of the special defenses and counterclaims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The general partner admitted in deposition that he signed the note and a mortgage as a general partner, that he signed a guaranty, and that no payment had been made on the note for months. As to the general partner's special defense and the first count of his counterclaim that there was an oral agreement with the bank that it would accept a deed of the property secured by the mortgage for full satisfaction of the debt if it were satisfied after an appraisal and an environmental study, the court ruled that the language was merely expressions of preliminary acts on which to predicate a future contract. A second special defense had no merit, because the general partner was held to knowledge of the contents of a written document that he signed. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a, which provided a mandatory addition of 12 percent annual interest on the total amount recovered by a plaintiff if it was equal to or exceeded an offer of judgment made by the plaintiff which was not accepted by the defendant, was not unconstitutional. The court calculated the unchallenged debt plus interest. The inclusion of punitive interest under &sect; 52-192a was to await the inclusion of any award for attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the bank against the general partner in the amount of the debt plus per diem judgment interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner appealed from a decision by defendant Middletown Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Agency (Connecticut), which denied the landowner's application for land development. The landowner moved to introduce evidence outside the administrative record to show that the Agency committed procedural irregularities and to show that the Agency's denial of the landowner's application constituted an unconstitutional taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner contended, among other things, that the Agency improperly considered evidence not entered at the public hearing, that the Agency held a secret meeting and took a secret vote in violation of its own regulations, and that two of the Agency's commissioners were prejudiced to the landowner's application. The landowner sought permission to conduct discovery of relevant material and to strike from the record certain documents that were not entered into evidence at the public hearing. The court granted the landowner's motion to introduce evidence outside of the record regarding the secret meeting and vote because a secret predetermination of a later vote, if proven, constituted a procedural irregularity. The court, in its discretion, allowed both parties to present additional evidence regarding the issue of whether a Soil Conservation Service letter constituted an ex parte communication because reliance on an ex parte communication was a procedural irregularity. The court found no other procedural irregularities because the Agency's reliance on testimony from one of its official was proper, and the record did not support a finding of prejudice or impartiality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the landowner's request for permission to introduce evidence outside of the record regarding the Agency's secret meeting and vote.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former client sought a prejudgment remedy of garnishment and attachment against defendants, professional corporation and attorneys, in a class action for excessive fees in violation of CUTPA, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110b, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, theft in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-251c, common law misrepresentation, and professional negligence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contingent fee agreements allowed attorney fees of one-third of the former client's recovery. The attorneys deducted the one-third and additional fees for payment of the no-fault lien, which they failed to disclose to the client. The client filed a class action and filed a motion for prejudgment garnishment and attachment. The court granted the motion. There was probable cause that the client would be successful under her first five counts. The deduction of additional fees for the release of the lien was a practice which offended CUTPA, was unethically concealed from the client, and injured the client. The collection of greater fees than provided for in the retainer agreement was a breach of contract. Because an attorney-client relationship had existed, the attorneys were unlikely to demonstrate they had not breached their fiduciary duty. Precedent indicated that treble damages for theft would lie for the interest and principle of the overcharged fees. The overstatement of the no-fault lien was a knowingly made false representation, which had induced injury in the client. However, breach of the professional rules of conduct had not created a malpractice action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the Connecticut Supreme Court, the trial court reviewed the Commissioner's administrative record to determine if the scope of the clean-up orders issued administratively to plaintiffs were reasonable or whether the imposition of joint and several responsibility upon plaintiffs was an abuse of the Commissioner's discretion. The court on remand determined that the Commissioner at the prior administrative hearing had never addressed the issue of combined or alternative causes for the environmental harm before imposing the cleanup responsibility on plaintiffs for cleaning up waste deposited by other companies.. The administrative record reflected that the Commissioner had opposed plaintiffs' efforts at the administrative proceeding to join other solid waste depositors as parties and the court found that apportionment was never addressed at the administrative hearing level and the Commissioner had thereby abused his discretion. Because the administrative record was inadequate to determine that there was no reasonable basis for apportioning damage cleanup responsibility, the court remanded the matter for additional agency proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated that portion of the Commissioner's orders requiring plaintiffs to clean the waste dump site and remanded the matter to the Commissioner for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court had held that Connecticut's mechanic's lien law, Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mechanic's lienor argued that three different statutory schemes provided for hearings on the validity of a mechanic's lien, and that its lien should therefore be given priority. The court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 4-39 and 4-35a(c) did not satisfy due process hearing requirements because a mortgagee would be required to wait a year for a hearing. But the court agreed with the mechanic's lienor that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-37, which offered the mortgagee an opportunity for a hearing upon the posting of a bond, comported with due process. It rejected the mortgagee's argument that &sect; 49-37 could not be used to determine the priority of liens, and distinguished cases holding that in certain circumstances, the requirement of a pre-hearing bond was such an onerous condition that it constituted a denial of due process. The bank would not suffer any hardship from the bond requirement. The court also found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-51 gave the mortgagee the opportunity for a prompt hearing in compliance with due process requirements. It rejected the mortgagee's claim that it was denied due process because of lack of notice, stressing that the work itself provided notice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mechanic's lienor motioned for reconsideration of the Superior Court at Hartford (Connecticut), in which the court denied priority of its lien over the mortgage of defendant mortgagee-bank. The mechanic's lienor was denied priority based on the ground that the Connecticut Mechanic's Lien Law, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-33 et seq., did not afford the mortgagee-bank the due process right to a hearing to contest the mechanic's lien.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mechanic's lienor motioned the court to reconsider its denial of its application for foreclosure, claiming that the pattern of statutes constituting the Connecticut Mechanic's Lien Law, &sect; 49-33 et seq., did, in fact, create rights in the mortgagee-bank to a hearing that met constitutional muster, particularly when the interests of the mechanic's lienor and the mortgagee-bank were appropriately balanced. The mortgagee-bank had the power under &sect; 49-37, if it filed a bond, to assert the priority over the mechanic's lien. As a bank, the mortgagee was assumed to have been familiar with the necessity for bonds in commercial transactions and could hardly have claimed that a bond requirement would have imposed a burden. Since, when the due process clause was applied, account was to be taken of the circumstances of the parties; the court concluded that requiring the mortgagee-bank to file a bond as a condition to obtaining a hearing was not so onerous that it constituted a denial of due process. On reconsideration, the court reversed itself and found the Connecticut Mechanic's Lien Law, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-33 et seq., was constitutional as applied to the mortgagee-bank.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the application for an order foreclosing the mechanic's lien since the Connecticut Mechanic's Lien Law was constitutional as applied to the mortgagee-bank. The mechanic's lienor's lien on the property was determined to have had priority over the mortgagee-bank's mortgage. Accordingly, a judgment of strict foreclosure was to be entered in favor of the mechanic's lienor.</SPAN></P>

The association filed a notice of lis pendens under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-325. The partnership filed a motion to discharge the notice of lis pendens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The condominium association alleged that the declarant of the condominium had fraudulently conveyed 34 units to the partnership whose partners were identical to those of the declarant, and that the transfer rendered the declarant insolvent. The partnership argued that &sect; 52-325, the lis pendens statute, deprived it of property without due process of law because it did not provide for a hearing before a party recorded the notice of lis pendens. The partnership also argued that the probable cause standard set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278 was unconstitutional. The court denied the motion. The court held that: (1) neither the risk of erroneous deprivation under Connecticut's lis pendens statute nor the probable value of additional or alternative safeguards were great enough to require a pre-deprivation hearing; (2) the probable cause standard in &sect; 52-278 was not unconstitutional; (3) the association had a strong interest in ensuring that a pre-judgment transfer of the property did not defeat its claim; exigent circumstances existed for filing the notice of lis pendens; and (4) the partnership was only entitled to an immediate post-deprivation hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff condominium owners sought review of a decision of defendant, a zoning board of appeals, which approved defendant, a trustee's, application to rezone a parcel of land and his application for a site plan approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustee submitted an application to the zoning board of appeals to rezone a parcel of approximately 72,000 square feet in an area fronting on a street in which the condominium owners owned property. The trustee was the owner of development rights to the parcel of land. The application requested a change of zone from commercial and multi-family to a mixed-use district. The trustee's second application was for a site plan approval. The application proposed four or five-story buildings with 89 residential units and a two level 205 space parking garage on the site. The applications were approved. In the condominium owners' appeal of the decision they alleged that the zoning board of appeals acted illegally, arbitrarily, and in abuse of its discretion by approving the applications. They alleged that the zoning board of appeals failed to impose conditions that concerned traffic and parking and failed to properly consider the public health, safety convenience, welfare, and property values. The court dismissed the appeal. The court held that the condominium owners failed to sustain their burden of establishing that the zoning board had acted unfairly in approving the applications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-wife obtained an ex parte order against her husband under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-15, suspending his right of visitation to his children, and enjoined him from visiting his ex-wife, or in any way abusing, harassing, or threatening her or their children. The ex-husband filed a motion to dismiss the order, claiming that &sect; 46b-15 deprived him of his due process rights because the order was issued without notice or hearing. The court held that based on the application and the ex-wife's affidavit, the allegations provided suffice to conclude the risk of erroneous deprivation at the time of the issuance of the ex parte order was not substantial enough to say that the deprivation was arbitrary or unreasonable. The court also noted that &sect; 46b-15 was directly necessary to effect the valid government interest in protecting the victims of physical abuse and preventing family violence. The court noted that given the interest of the ex-wife in being free from physical abuse, the important interest of the government in preventing abuse and the limited degree of risk of erroneous deprivation, the ex-husband had not carried his burden of proving that the order was unconstitutional obtained.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that in appropriate factual situations, a motion for summary judgment could be used to determine issues relating to governmental immunity. The court granted the motion for partial summary judgment because it held that the superintendent was a public officer who, under the facts of the case, owed a duty to the public but did not owe the student a duty. In addition, the court held that even if the superintendent's obligation constituted a private duty, the acts alleged by the student did not come within any of the exceptions relating to liability of public officers for discretionary acts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant argued that the activities sought in the application were permitted under Conn. Gen.

The applicant also contended that the Agency lacked jurisdiction over the premises because the report of the Agency's soil scientist classified wetland soils on the applicant's lot as transitional wetlands. The applicant further contended that the Agency did not have authority to consider feasible alternatives and, collectively, the Agency's action constituted a taking. The court dismissed the appeal, finding that the court lacked jurisdiction to consider the applicant's contention under &sect; 22a-40(a)(2) because the applicant failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Further, the court found that the applicant could not challenge the Agency's jurisdiction because the application related to a regulated activity, not to a change in boundary. Additionally, the court could not say that the Agency acted improperly in denying a permit where a feasible alternative to the proposed activity existed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that the ruling of the trial court denying him an opportunity to present evidence to support his jury array challenge at trial constituted &quot;cause&quot; in that he was precluded from perfecting his claim because &quot;some objective&quot; factor external to the defense impeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State's procedural rule. The court concluded that the inmate failed to show that there was good cause for his failure to raise before trial the claim of unconstitutional jury composition as a result of having failed to pursue that claim on direct appeal. The court found that it was necessary to raise constitutional issues not only in the state trial but also in the state appeal and that the failure to raise such issues either in the state trial or in the state appeal invoked the cause and prejudice test. The court was unable to find any case in which a ruling of a trial court that was not raised on direct appeal had ever been found to be a factor external to the defense so as to allow the issue to be raised in a habeas corpus petition.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the inmate failed to show that there was good cause for his failure to raise before trial the claim of unconstitutional jury composition as a result of the actions of the office of public defender because the actions of the public defender's office were not actions that were external to the defense. The court determined that the issue before the court was not simply whether, as the inmate argued, there was some interference by officials. The court found that the issue before the court was whether there was some interference by officials &quot;external to the defense&quot; that prohibited the inmate from raising a jury array challenge. The court was satisfied that the office of the public defender was not external to the defense, but rather a part of the defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission denied the church a special permit to construct a church building in a residential zone. The church appealed. The court sustained the appeal and reversed the decision. The court noted that close scrutiny was necessary because the Commission's action indirectly implicated freedom of religion. The court held that the Commission abused its discretion in denying a permit based on traffic considerations without evidence of changed traffic conditions on the roads near the project. The proper consideration for traffic with respect to zoning was not whether the use increased traffic volume, but whether it caused a traffic hazard or traffic congestion. The Commission had not expressly made a finding of traffic congestion. The increased traffic from the construction of the church building did not warrant the limitation of freedom of religion by the denial of a special permit. The court held that the Commission had the right to attach reasonable conditions to the special permit as necessary to protect public health, safety, convenience, and property values pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer saw the driver strike the rear of a vehicle stopped at a stop sign. The officer noted a strong odor of alcohol on the driver's breath. The driver's eyes were bloodshot and watery, his speech was slurred, and he appeared dazed and confused. The driver was unable to complete a field sobriety test and was arrested. He was advised of the mandatory alcohol testing requirements of the implied consent statute and was offered an opportunity to contact a lawyer. The driver refused to submit to a blood alcohol test. A hearing was held by the Department of Motor Vehicles, and the hearing officer suspended the driver's license to operate a motor vehicle. The court affirmed finding that substantial evidence existed to reasonably support the administrative determination limited to the issues mandated by the implied consent law, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b. The court held that the driver's claims regarding lack of compliance with certain procedural actions set forth in the statute were beyond the scope of the issues to which the court was limited for purposes of judicial review and were not linked relevantly to any claimed substantial rights alleged to have been prejudiced.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer, seeking summary judgment, filed a second amended complaint, alleging that the tax assessor failed to revalue its realty in 1988 and that its failure to revalue was a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-62a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer alleged that the assessor violated his statutory duty by failing to revalue his property 10 years after the last valuation and thus caused the taxpayer to pay more taxes than it would otherwise have paid. The taxpayer sought an order of mandamus to compel the assessor to revise the 1988 grand list and revalue the property as allegedly required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-62a. The taxpayer also requested a restraining order precluding the city from collecting the remainder of the levied tax or from adding interest payments onto the unpaid remainder. The taxpayer alleged that the taxes levied were manifestly excessive and illegal and sought reimbursement. The city asserted two special defenses, laches and that it owed no duty to revalue under the 1999 Conn. Acts 89-251, &sect; 190, an amendment to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-62. The taxpayer filed a motion for summary judgment. Upon review, the court was unable to resolve the issues because the taxpayer failed to reply to the city's special defense of laches, because the pleadings were never closed, and because of the existence of a material issue as to whether imposition of tax was excessive or not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that two special defenses raised genuine issues of fact. First, defendants claimed that Conn.

The court held that, because due process rights could be waived, &sect; 52-278f was constitutional. Second, defendants asserted that the maker breached a covenant of good faith and fair dealing with regard to the promissory note. The court held that a conclusory allegation in an affidavit of one defendant was insufficient to defeat the maker's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the motion for permission to withdraw as counsel, finding that an appeal had little likelihood of success and that it lacked merit. The court also declined to appoint successor counsel due to the court's conclusion that none of defendant's points were even arguable. The court found that there was no support in the record as to defendant's claim that the jury was not properly charged. The court also held that defendant's motion to suppress was validly denied because, even if defendant showed that the non-suggestive disputed identification was prejudicial, that identification was adequately reliable to be admissible. The court further reasoned that the claim that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict lacked merit because the State submitted an adequate factual basis of proof on each element of defendant's offense such that a reasonable trier of facts could have determined that the State showed guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner instituted an action for a declaratory judgment to challenge the validity of an inland wetlands regulation promulgated by defendant Town of East Lyme Conservation Commission (Connecticut) and the Commission's action declaring that the owner's inland wetlands permit had expired. The owner also sought equitable relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission issued the owner an inland wetlands permit to construct roadway and driveway crossings within a subdivision. The owner performed some work within the proposed subdivision area, but the vast majority of the work was done outside of the inland wetland and buffer areas. The Commission then found that the permit had expired because no significant work had been initiated within one year, as required by East Lyme, Conn., Inland Wetland and Watercourses Regs. &sect; 7.2. After the suit was filed, the Commission approved the owner's application for a second permit, which did not allow the owner to fill in as much wetlands. The owner sought a declaratory judgment that &sect; 7.2 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to the owner, and an order declaring the Commission's revocation of the first permit void. The court did not address the constitutional issue, but granted a declaratory judgment that &sect; 7.2 was invalid, as applied to the owner, because, inter alia, it was in conflict with the Inland Wetlands &amp; Watercourses Act and regulations promulgated under the Act, which required a hearing prior to the revocation of a permit. The permit revocation was also declared void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was entered for the owner declaring the challenged section of the Commission's regulations invalid as applied to the owner. The Commission's action in declaring the permit invalid was declared void and of no effect. The Commission was ordered to reinstate the permit under the same terms and conditions upon which it was previously issued, with an expiration date, subject to extension as provided by the regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action, plaintiff inmate filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking to prohibit the enforcement of a cigarette tax under 1989 Conn. Acts 16, &sect; 28 because it was unconstitutional and violated his rights to due process and equal protection of the law under both the state and federal constitutions. Defendants, the commissioners of the departments of revenue and corrections, filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An earlier state law provided an exemption to state prisoners from payment of a cigarette tax. In 1989, the state legislature amended Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-297 with the passage of 1989 Conn. Acts. 16, &sect; 28 that ended the exemption. The prisoner sought a declaratory judgment that the new law was unconstitutional and also sought to prohibit the collection of the tax. His complaint alleged jurisdiction under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52-1 and 52-29. The court held that the amendment of the statute did not violate the prisoner's right to equal protection of the law, nor his right to due process. The court reasoned that the legislature had wide latitude with regard to tax classifications and that the prisoner had failed to demonstrate a lack of a rational basis to support it. The court noted that there was a rational basis for the distinction made in the amendment between inmates and patients of other state institutions. Also the court found that the correction department's rules concerning access and possession of cigarettes did not suggest an inmate had entitlement to any specific amount or price. The court granted the commissioners' motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

The corporation objected to the attempted attachment and challenged the constitutionality of the statute because it did not require the posting of a bond by the builder and the statute was vague. The court ruled that the statute was constitutional. The court held that the failure of the statute to provide for the posting of a bond or other security did not render the act unconstitutional and that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner applied to the commission to cross a wetland to construct a road in connection with a residential subdivision. The commission granted the application with the condition that there had to remain a 75-foot setback or buffer zone along the length of the wetland in which construction was prohibited. The owner appealed asserting that he should have been allowed to impose those restrictions by means of a declaration applicable to the lots filed in the land records because one of the commission's advisors indicated such would have been acceptable. The court held that the decision concerning what constituted an acceptable means of providing the buffer zone rested with the commission, not the advisor. Further, as it was a matter of public regulation of a wetland, not a private matter, as provided for in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-38 et seq., the commission acted fully within its powers and did not abuse its discretion. The court then would not substitute its judgment for the commission's which had before it substantial reasons for establishing the setback buffer zone. The owner's appeal was dismissed and judgment in the commission's favor was entered.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from the decision, plaintiff argued three points of error. The court dismissed the appeal. Specifically, the court held that the Commission did not violate its own regulations and enabling legislation because its decision clearly stated the factor upon which it relied in rendering its decision denying plaintiff's application. Furthermore, the court found that the record contained substantial evidence to support the Commission's denial where there was testimony of abutting owners concerning the possibility of flooding, potential pollution of local wells, recommended alternatives by the town conservation commission, and testimony concerning the impact on local flora and fauna. Finally, the court found that the denial of plaintiff's application was not an unlawful taking of its property because there was no showing that the Commission would not allow any or all reasonable alternative uses of its property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A motorist was arrested for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The arresting officer, acting on behalf of the Commissioner, revoked and took possession of the motorist's driver's license and issued him a temporary license, because he refused to submit to a chemical test to measure his blood alcohol level. An administrative hearing was conducted and the hearing officer upheld the suspension of the motorist's license for six months. The court dismissed the motorist's appeal. The court held that the Commissioner's decision adversely affected a specific personal and legal interest of the motorist, his right to operate a motor vehicle, and therefore, he was aggrieved by that decision. However, the suspension was upheld because there was sufficient evidence before the hearing officer to support his affirmative findings under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b(f). The officer's observation of the motorist trying to conceal something fell short of establishing probable cause to arrest him for anything, they did provide a reasonable basis for suspecting the motorist of criminal activity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time the parties were divorced, the father was working but the mother was unemployed. The father remarried and had two other children. He left his job to concentrate on establishing his businesses and to take care of his children from his second marriage. The mother filed a motion for modification of child support relying, at least in part, on Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-215b(b), which made the Child Support Guidelines an item for consideration in any modification of a support order. The father challenged the constitutionality of the guidelines. The court found the guidelines did not apply because the father's present spouse was not responsible for the child of his former marriage and because the support order had to be predicated upon earning capacity as distinguished from actual earnings. The court held that the father's voluntary termination of employment was a substantial change of circumstances warranting a modification of the child support order. The court found that a revised support order whereby the father was charged with the mother's unreimbursed medical expenses for the minor child was well within the father's earning capacity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the child support order to increase the amount the father was to pay the mother for child support. The court granted the mother's request for attorney's fees related to the prosecution of her motion for increased support. The court denied the mother's request for the imposition of a real estate lien.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Connecticut judicial review council, filed an administrative appeal from a decision of defendant, agency pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1-21i(d) and 4-183. The council sought to vacate, set aside, or modify a decision of the agency that concluded that the council was a public agency and, as such, was required to make its records available to the general public in conformity to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-18a(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal concerned information that was requested by a newspaper reporter who wanted access to the statistics on judicial discipline. The reporter was denied access by the judicial review council, and the reporter then successfully brought an administrative action. The council appealed from the administrative decision. The court found that about 80 percent of all complaints against judges were dismissed through a probable cause hearing, which was private and confidential unless the judge chose otherwise. When probable cause was found for judicial misconduct, the commission was required to conduct a public hearing. If judicial misconduct was found at the public hearing stage, the commission could sanction the judge as prescribed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-51n. The court determined that the reporter's request did not violate the policy of the commission. Rather, it sought information that was compiled and distributed to the public. Sufficient practices were in place to protect the judiciary from wholesale, frivolous, and ungrounded complaints.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal and ordered the council to make its records available to the public in a manner that was consistent with the requirements of the opinion of the court.</SPAN></P>

The JRC sought to vacate, to set aside, or to modify the FOIC's decision, which ordered the JRC to act in compliance with the provisions of &sect; 1-19 (a), Connecticut's right-to-know statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A reporter orally requested access to the JRC's statistics on judicial discipline for 1988 and 1989. The JRC denied access on grounds that the 1989 statistics had not been compiled and that the compiled 1988 statistics were available at the Center for Judicial Conduct Organization, in Chicago, where they had been transmitted earlier. The FOIC ordered the JRC to provide the 1989 statistics. The issue was whether the public had access to JRC statistical data prior to its compilation and distribution to the public. The court held that the compilation of data did not change otherwise inaccessible data into accessible data. When information was recognized as part of the public record, it was so nascently and not because of some maturation process. Once data was conceded as &quot;non-confidential&quot; and eventually accessible to the public, then &sect; 1-19 (a) did not reserve to the keeper of that data the power to decide when the data could be released to the public.</SPAN></P>

The board sustained the zoning enforcement officer's denial of their request for a certificate of compliance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The waste authority and city sought from the township a certificate of zoning compliance concerning their operation of a landfill as a non-conforming use. The waste authority on land owned by the city and located within the township operated the landfill. The board upheld the zoning enforcement officer's denial of the certificate. The denial was predicated on the premise that the non-conforming use had been unlawfully expanded. Additionally, the commission refused to amend the zoning regulations, which would have allowed solid waste disposal facilities as permitted uses in an aquifer protection district. The waste authority and the city sought judicial review and the cases were consolidated. The court held: (1) that the waste authority and the city were aggrieved parties and had standing to appeal; (2) that the illegal expansion claim was moot because the area had been used for solid waste disposal since 1984; (3) that the evidence supported that entire area could be utilized for the non-conforming use of a waste facility; and (4) that there was no evidence to support the commission's finding that a total ban of solid waste facilities within the district was justified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the board, which had upheld the denial of a certificate of compliance, and remanded the matter to the board with an order that it proceed according to law. The court also sustained the appeal from the denial of the application to amend the aquifer protection district regulations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners alleged that they were aggrieved by the illegal action, in that the application complied with the requirements of the regulations and that the zoning commission based the decision on reasons that were not lawful, the reasons were not supported by the record or substantial evidence, and that the zoning commission exceeded its authority, all of which deprived the owners of the lawful use of its property. The court found that to demonstrate the requisite finality, the owners, asserting a regulatory taking claim, bore the burden of proving that the zoning commission would not allow any reasonable alternative use of his property. The owners did not present this matter to the agency and, therefore, not to the court that the owners' interest in developing the property merits constitutional protection against uncompensated regulatory takings. Also, the court did not find that the denial of this one application demonstrated that the zoning commission would not allow any reasonable residential development, particularly when the denial appeared based on the footprint of the proposed buildings and the volume of fill to be placed on the intermittent watercourse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were members of the bargaining unit represented by the union. Changes in mayors caused the employees to worry about their positions. The union filed a complaint of unfair labor practices against the town and asserted that the town notified the employees of their termination in violation of a collective bargaining agreement. The town had notified the employees of termination of their employment pending resolution of certain complaints to the State Labor Relations Board and the State Board of Mediation and Arbitration. The employees then filed an application for a preliminary injunction in opposition to the proposed action. The town claimed that its actions were authorized by the town charter and that injunctive relief was unwarranted. On review, the court found that the town gave notice of imposition of a unilateral change in terms and conditions of employment without negotiating with the union, and that this violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-470(a)(4) and therefore the town threatened an &quot;unlawful act&quot; pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13-115.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The investment company brought four foreclosure actions against the property owner. After strict foreclosure judgments were entered the owner brought an action in the federal court, which was dismissed. He then brought the present action. All his counts had been struck except the one for abuse of process. The court granted the investment company's motion for summary judgment. The court stated that it was clear that pursuant to his pleadings, the conduct complained of ended in June, 1986 and, therefore, he had to assert his claim for abuse of process by June of 1989. Since it was filed for the first time in 1990, it was time barred by the three-year limitation period of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-577. The court held that his amendment did not relate back to the original filing date. The court noted that when an amendment to a complaint set up a new and different cause of action, for statute of limitations issues the court looked at the date the amendment was filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a local union and town employees, sought a preliminary injunction to restrain defendants, a town and a mayor, from giving effect to notices terminating the employees pending resolution of certain complaints to the Connecticut Labor Relations Board and the Connecticut Board of Mediation and Arbitration. Defendants argued that their actions were authorized by the town's charter and that injunctive relief was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed that the notices constituted unlawful violations of the parties' bargaining agreement, which required just cause for terminations. After a hearing, the court agreed. First, the court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-113 did not bar injunctive relief, in light of caselaw interpreting its federal counterpart, the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 104, so as not to bar an order requiring an employer to reinstate an employee discharged in violation of a collective bargaining agreement. Further, the notice of the town's imposition of a unilateral change in the conditions of the employees' employment without union negotiation constituted the threat of an unlawful act within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-115. Further, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-474 was a constitutional exercise of legislative power that overrode the town charter provision permitting the discharge of mayoral appointees upon term expirations. Because the prohibited practice in question was an unlawful repudiation of a crucial contract provision, the court held that the harm to the union would be substantial and irreparable and without adequate remedy at law. Thus, injunctive relief was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlords rented commercial premises to the tenant, which was a limited partnership. When the tenant could not pay the rent, the landlords suggested that the tenant borrow money from the landlords' corporation to help defray some of the rent due. As a condition of the loan, the partners signed the promissory note as guarantors. When both the rent and note went into default, the landlords brought an action for the balance due and also sought prejudgment attachment of the guarantors' real estate interest. The guarantors objected, arguing that the United States Supreme Court had held that ex parte attachment of real estate under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278e(a)(1) violated due process. The court disagreed and granted the motion after conducting a hearing. The court noted that the U.S. Supreme Court refused to comment on the probable cause standard used to determine prejudgment attachment motions and that the full evidentiary hearing conducted by the court did not violate due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee contended that the police lacked sufficient cause or reason to stop the licensee prior to arresting him and, therefore, the Commissioner's findings and conclusions on the issues of probable cause and arrest were erroneous. The court determined that the nature of the alleged crime, zigzagging on the road, did not require an investigative stop to confirm the anonymous source tip. Indeed, a more effective investigative procedure, and a less intrusive one, would have been to observe the operation of the vehicle for a longer period of time to see if the essence of the tip could be corroborated. The court held that the requirement in Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-227b(f) that the person to be &quot;placed under arrest&quot; meant that the arrest was required to be valid and lawful. Thus, at a license suspension hearing, the hearing officer was required to find that the arrest was valid and lawful in determining whether the person was &quot;placed under arrest.&quot; Because the court found that the evidence in the record revealed that the investigatory stop by the police was unlawful, it followed that the Commissioner's finding that the licensee was &quot;placed under arrest&quot; was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b following the motorist's arrest for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The motorist was arrested. Chemical tests indicated that his blood alcohol level exceeded .10 per cent. The police, acting on behalf of the Commissioner, suspended his license pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b(c). The motorist requested a hearing. The hearing officer found, among other things, that the arresting officer had probable cause to arrest the motorist. The motorist challenged the hearing officer's probable cause determination. The court held that the probable cause requirement of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b(f) encompassed the requirement that an initial investigative stop of the driver of a vehicle be lawful and that the requirement of &sect; 14-227b(f) that the person be found to have been placed under arrest had to be interpreted to mean lawful arrest. The investigatory stop of the motorist was unlawful. The whole picture that the police had consisted of an informant's tip of erratic driving combined with the police officers' brief observation of the motorist's vehicle being operated normally. The information did not even provide a particularized and objective basis for suspecting the motorist of driving the vehicle erratically at some point prior to their observation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner owned and operated a commercial landscaping business. He purchased a lot that was initially zoned for local business and the commission later re-zoned the lot as residential. The landowner appealed and asserted that the commission's decision was arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable and illegal. The landowner further alleged that the commission's decision to alter the classification of the lot constituted a taking of the property. It was finally urged that the decision had been reached in violation of the landowner's due process rights. On review, the court found that the proposed changes were in harmony with the town's regulations and the comprehensive plans and the decision was not arbitrary. The court also ruled that there had been no unconstitutional taking of the landowner's property. This was because the restriction only stopped the landowner from expanding the current use of his land and there was no showing that the property's value had been diminished. The court finally ruled that the landowner's claim that he was deprived of his due process rights was without merit as the public hearings were held in accordance with Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insured brought an action against defendant insurer, alleging that the insurer had not paid compensation under her underinsured motorist coverage, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-336. The insurer of the other driver paid the policy limits, which was insufficient to compensate plaintiff for her severe injuries sustained from a motor vehicle accident. The insurer brought a motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer alleged that the insured had not filed a claim within two years of the accident, as required under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-290(d). The insured contended that the provision only applied to uninsured motorist claims and that her claim did not accrue until the underlying carrier had paid its policy limits. The court held that the policy was ambiguous, that the policy was to be construed in favor of the insured, that the statute of limitations had not run, and that summary judgment was, thus, inappropriate. The insurer's policy was ambiguous by its requirement that an insured bring a claim within two years of an accident and that coverage would only be made after limits of liability under any applicable liability policy was exhausted. Where the statute of limitations for an underinsured case ran from the date of exhaustion of a tortfeasor's liability coverage, any construction of &sect; 38a-290 that would permit an insurer to enforce a two-year statute of limitations for bringing claims under an underinsured policy could amount to an unconstitutional violation of due process rights. The six-year limitation, set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-576, was applicable to the claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff contractor agreed to construct a building for defendant owner and started work prior to the owner's execution of a mortgage to defendant bank. When the owner failed to pay invoices, the contractor filed a mechanic's lien and brought suit against the bank and the owner to foreclose on its lien, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-33 et. seq. The contractor and the bank asserted priority of their encumbrances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank asserted that the mechanic's lien statute was unconstitutional. Utilizing a three-fold inquiry to determine whether the bank was denied due process, the court held that the contractor's lien was secondary in priority to the bank's mortgage. First, the lien's restriction on the bank's opportunity for, and the possibility of, property alienation was a significant taking. Second, the bank was not entitled to notice of the filing of the lien under &sect; 49-34, and to a prompt hearing to reduce or discharge the lien under &sect; 49-35a, because the bank was not an owner of the property within the meaning of the statute. Thus, the statute could not constitutionally operate to give the lien priority over the mortgage unless the contractor's heightened property interest tipped the constitutional scale in its favor. Third, the high interest in protecting the lien could not have superseded the constitutional right to a meaningful hearing by those affected by the lien. Thus, to the extent that the law operated to give priority of the contractor's lien over the bank's mortgage, it would have violated the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.</SPAN></P>

Without his assent, several police officers were posted to the nightclub on the night of the concert. The Commission billed the individual for the officers' services pursuant to Conn. Gen.

The Commission filed a motion to strike, claiming that the individual did not have standing to seek the relief requested. The court denied the motion to strike, finding that because the individual alleged he was no longer willing to book controversial performers, he alleged facts that demonstrated the existence of a legally cognizable injury sufficient to support his standing. The court held that the rights asserted were sufficiently important, and the danger of their infringement sufficiently great, to confer upon the individual third-party standing. The court noted that declaratory judgments presenting challenges to the applicability and constitutionality of a statute were proper although they affected parties other than those before the court.</SPAN></P>

Despite the plaintiff's failure to file a response in opposition to the Commissioner's motion to dismiss his complaint, the court decided the motion on the merits. The court held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the claim against the Commissioner, an agent of the State, because the State was the real party to the action and was entitled to sovereign immunity. The court held that the statutory consent and constitutional claim exceptions to immunity did not apply. The court found that the plaintiff alleged that the Commissioner breached a statutory duty but did not identify any specific statutory duty that would waive immunity on the facts. The court held that the claim did not allege a constitutional violation or that a State official was acting in excess of his authority. The court held that the plaintiff failed to obtain the consent of the claims commissioner to file an action against the State, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-141 et seq., specifically Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners brought an action for declaratory relief after defendant Court of Common Council of the City of Hartford (Connecticut), while acting as the zoning commission, changed the zone classification affecting the owners' property.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The council changed the zoning classification from B-3 to R-3 and the owners failed to appeal the decision. Instead, the owners brought their action which alleged the ordinance was invalid and the council engaged in actions that were in excess of its authority. The council moved to dismiss on the basis that the owners failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, specifically the appeal procedure afforded by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8. In the alternative, the council argued that if the action was construed as an appeal, it was jurisdictionally defective because it was not brought within the time limitations of &sect; 8-8(b). The court agreed. The substance of the owners' claims were that the council acted incorrectly in changing the zone classification of their properties. Although the owners might have had grounds for appealing the council's decision in changing the zones, they did not have grounds for bringing an independent action for a declaratory judgment. Additionally, the action was brought after the appeal period had expired, therefore, the court could not consider the action even if it could be construed as an appeal of the council's decision.</SPAN></P>

The court sustained the adjoining landowners' appeal and held that the Board had granted the variance without a showing of sufficient hardship by the applicants and that the granting of the variance was not harmonious with the town's comprehensive zoning plan and constituted a substantial change in the uses permitted in a flood plain zone. The court found that the required notice given to the surrounding communities was sufficient to give the Board jurisdiction over the applicant's request for the variance. The court found that the Board had insufficient evidence of the applicant's hardship that would arise from the denial of the variance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicants brought an administrative appeal from the decision of respondent Canton Zoning Commission (Connecticut), which denied the applicants' request for a special exception to permit the enlargement of a nonconforming use of property that was the site of a manufacturing facility. The Commission stated that the proposed expansion of the nonconforming use was contrary to the provisions of Canton, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 52.6.4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants operated the manufacturing facility on approximately seven acres of land located in a residential zone. The business was legally operated as a nonconforming use. The court pointed out that the decision of the commission had to be sustained if the record supported any of the reasons given. The court reviewed the record as to each of the five standards contained within &sect; 52.6.4. It was found that: 1) the commission did not apply any measurable or objective criteria in denying the application on the grounds of compatibility, and the record did not contain sufficient evidence to justify a denial on that ground, 2) the record did not support a finding that there would be a significant increase in traffic, and 3) there was insufficient evidence to support the claim that concern over the discharge of storm water and sewerage justified denial of the application. However, the court also found: 1) there was substantial evidence for the commission to have concluded that a substantial expansion of the facility would be inconsistent with the existing and future character of the neighborhood, and 2) there was substantial evidence to support concerns about destruction of wetlands.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the State of Connecticut Commission on Hospitals and Health Care, alleged in a three-count complaint that defendant, a health care facility that provided diagnostic services, failed to obtain approval from the Commission before introducing Magnetic Resonance Imaging Services (MRI).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission alleged that the facility violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 19a-154, 19a-155(a), and 19a-155(b) when it introduced MRI services before obtaining approval from the Commission to provide such services and to acquire major medical equipment. In its motion for summary judgment under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 19a-154, the Commission argued that MRI services were an &quot;additional function or service&quot; that the facility had introduced into its health care program for which the facility needed prior approval. The facility argued that MRI services, rather than being an &quot;additional function or service,&quot; were an enhancement to the facility's existing diagnostic imaging services that the facility had supplied since its inception. The court denied the Commission's motion for summary judgment. A genuine issue of material fact remained whether the introduction of MRI services constituted an &quot;additional function or service&quot; under &sect; 19a-154. That determination was a question of fact for the trier of fact to resolve, and summary judgment was thus improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff had been defendant's accountant, and defendant had been a real estate developer but became a fire chief. They formed a partnership to develop real estate and borrowed money from a bank, and when plaintiff withdrew from the partnership, the bank took funds from plaintiff's account to reduce the debt. Plaintiff filed an action and a motion for a prejudgment remedy of attachment. Defendant opposed the motion, contending that because plaintiff was more sophisticated financially, there was a relationship with plaintiff as a fiduciary, giving rise to a presumption of fraud. The court held that defendant was required to show that plaintiff had superior knowledge and skill in real estate development and that because defendant had been a real estate developer and plaintiff was merely an accountant, defendant had failed to make such a showing. The court then addressed defendant's claim that the attachment violated due process because the question of probable cause was obscure and could give rise to confusion. The court held that defendant had not shown that the attachment was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the motion for an attachment was granted.</SPAN></P>

A hearing officer affirmed the suspension of the driver's license for six months. On appeal, the driver challenged the constitutionality of Connecticut's implied consent law on two grounds: (1) it violated one's right to due process pursuant to U.S. Const. Amend. IV and XIV and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 and 8 by ignoring the established and well founded judicial mandate that the fruits of an illegal automobile stop were to be suppressed and are inadmissible against a person charged with a crime; and (2) it violated the separation of powers provision of Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the recipient of public assistance from defendant, the State of Connecticut, Department of Income Maintenance, sought review of an administrative hearing decision upholding the Department's imposition, pursuant to Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department, pursuant to &sect;&sect; 17-83e and 17-83f, claimed an interest in the proceeds of the settlement and imposed a statutory lien thereon in order to secure the reimbursement of prior welfare assistance paid to the recipient. The recipient contended that &sect;&sect; 17-83e and 17-83f were unconstitutional, arguing that the State may not seek reimbursement out of proceeds that were intended to compensate her for physical injuries, pain and suffering, and physical disability, without violating her Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. The court held that the recipient had failed to meet her burden to prove that the law was unconstitutional on its face, as the law had a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state purpose. The court further held that the recipient could not equate the Department's claim to the settlement proceeds with a claim on what the proceeds were intended to compensate, and that exactions from personal injury recoveries designed to make people &quot;whole&quot; did not violate due process. The court concluded that, under the standards of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183(j), it must affirm the administrative decision.</SPAN></P>

The licensee requested a hearing and the officer ordered the suspension of his license for 90 days. The licensee appealed to the commissioner of the department of motor vehicles. The court held that the findings of the hearing officer relating to whether an operator's license was to be suspended for elevated blood alcohol content were not flawed by his reliance upon a particular form. The court determined that the licensee's counsel's general &quot;hearsay&quot; exception at the hearing was too vague to qualify as an objection under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b(c). The court further determined that the licensee's counsel had ample opportunity to examine the officer as to a misplaced signature. The court noted that this was not a test refusal case; the licensee's argument concerning the absence from the form of the endorsement of a third person was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

Defendants argued that the mortgage foreclosure action barred any other remedy to collect the mortgage debt and that the attachments were unnecessary until a deficiency was established. The court found that the prejudgment remedy of attachment was available as to all complaints containing a money demand under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-279. Conn. Gen. Stat.&nbsp;&sect; 49-1, which defined the effect of a foreclosure on a mortgage debt, did not proscribe prejudgment attachment by the foreclosing mortgagee in anticipation of a deficiency. Defendants also claimed that the mortgagee had not complied with new procedures that applied to the prejudgment attachments under &sect; 52-278f (amended by 1991 Conn. Pub. Acts 315).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city planned to rebuild a dilapidated railroad station and create affordable housing by implementing a long-range city plan. The lot owner claimed that the zoning commission had acted arbitrarily or illegally in modifying the zoning regulations. The court dismissed his appeal. The court held that amendments to zoning regulations to allow the developer to develop a project that was intended to be the cornerstone of a major, long-range city plan was not spot zoning because the regulations were in harmony with the comprehensive city plan. The court concluded that although the developer could receive incidental benefits, the amendments were not made primarily for the developer's benefit. The lot owner also contended that the parking regulations were contrary to the uniformity criteria of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2. The court disagreed and noted that such regulations were required to be made in accordance with a general plan. The regulations should also have been made with reasonable consideration as to the character of the district.

In response to the issues raised by the OCC in support of its appeal, the court found, among other things, that the DPUC's approval of the inclusion of a contract expense in CNG's rate structure was not clearly erroneous or an abuse of discretion because there was substantial evidence to support the CNG's decision that the subject contract was necessary to meet customer demand. The court also found that the DPUC's decision approving the CNG's depreciation expense was not clearly erroneous or an abuse of discretion. The court found that DPUC's adoption of the CNG's employment vacancy adjustment payroll expenses did not constitute reversible error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner owned three lots located in an approved residential subdivision. The property owner filed an application to conduct regulated activities on the lots and sought specifically approval to construct a house, accessory apartment, septic system, and a well on each lot. The conservation commission denied the application. The conservation commission denied the application because the proposed projects would cause significant permanent loss to the wetlands inventory and negative impacts on the remaining wetlands due to pollution. The property owner alleged that the conservation commission by denying it application acted illegally, arbitrarily and in abuse of its discretion. The property owner's major assertion on appeal was that the record did not support the conservation commission's decision. The court dismissed the property owner's appeal. The court stated that because the conservation commission considered the six factors under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-41 and the opinion of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection the conservation commission's decision was based upon it regulations and was reasonably supported by the record.</SPAN></P>

The realty corporation transferred all of its rights and interests in the subject property to the company. The company in a summary process action sought to recover possession of the premises. In the company's complaint it alleged that in 1991 the owner and lessor of the premises transferred all of its rights and interests in the premises to the company. The lessee's right to possession had terminated because of a lapse of time, and the company notified the lessee of its intentions to take possession upon the expiration of the lease. The company caused a notice to quit to be served upon the lessee. The lessee filed four special defenses and a counterclaim. The lessee's major special defense was that the sole and exclusive reason for the action taken was to wrongfully discriminated against the lessee, who operated a adult book store on the premises, by infringing on its rights to free speech. The court granted a judgment of possession in favor of the company. The court held that the lessee failed to establish the evidentiary predicate to support its claims made in the four special defenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicant appealed a decision of defendant, the Zoning Board of Appeals of the Town of Norwich (Connecticut), which denied its request for a special exception to permit construction of a new convalescent home and to conversion of an existing multi-family structure to administrative offices and day care for children of its employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Board member, who had disqualified himself from hearing the application, appeared at the hearing in his personal capacity and voiced his opposition to the application. The application was denied, and the applicant contended that the recused member's appearance at the hearing compromised the decision. In sustaining the appeal, the court held that the member's appearance violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-11. The court noted that &sect; 8-11 in part enjoined a board member not to participate in the hearing or decision of the board or commission of which he was a member upon any matter in which he was directly or indirectly interested in a personal or financial sense. The court held that this precluded the participation of the member at the hearing, even in his personal capacity. Given the acknowledged personal interest the member had in the matter, which after all had caused him to disqualify himself officially, the court held that the decision was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his motion to dissolve the prejudgment attachment, the guarantor contended that he signed the promissory note as general partner and was therefore not bound in his capacity as a guarantor by the commercial waiver provision which he signed in his personal capacity, and that Conn. Gen.

The promissory note contained a waiver provision; the guaranty signed by the guarantor personally did not, but a copy of the promissory note was attached to the guaranty as an exhibit. The court found that the guarantor was bound by the waiver provision contained in the promissory note that he signed and that was attached to the guaranty agreement as an exhibit. The court also rejected the guarantor's contention that &sect; 52-278f was unconstitutional. The fact that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278g had been found unconstitutional did not apply to Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner wanted to build on a 2.9 acre lot in an area zoned for 3 acre lots. The Board had denied the owner's application for a variance, and the superior court had dismissed the owner's appeal. The court denied the motion to strike a defense that was based on the owner's knowledge of the nonconformity at the time of purchase, and on the fact that the taking, if any, had occurred prior to the owner's purchase. The court also sustained a defense based on the fact that the owner's predecessor in title had created the hardship by creating a nonconforming lot. The court also sustained a defense that asserted that because the owner purchased with knowledge of the nonconformity, and paid accordingly, he suffered no damages. The court held that because damages were not available in the zoning hearing or the prior appeal, that judgment was not res judicata. The court held that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 provided a right of recovery on the facts alleged by the owner. The court rejected procedural challenges under Conn. Gen.

The waiver provided that defendants waived all rights of notice, judicial hearing or prior court order in connection the creditor's obtaining of any pre-judgment remedy in connection with the loan. The court denied defendant' motion to dissolve the attachments and garnishments of defendants' property by the creditor. The court found that defendants, as sophisticated and knowledgeable borrowers, waived their right to due process and an opportunity to be heard.

The court found that defendants failed to establish that Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner applied for a writ of habeas corpus based on claims that the retroactive application of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-100(b), as amended by 1989 Conn. Acts 383, &sect; 13, violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws and argued that the retroactive application of respondent Connecticut Commissioner of Corrections' regulation on supervised home release violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted on three counts of violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(b). The Commissioner's regulation, which disqualified inmates from supervised home release if they had been convicted of sales of drugs by non-drug dependent persons, was implemented prior to the enactment of 1989 Conn. Acts 383. Both the regulation and the statute were promulgated after the dates of petitioner's crimes. Due to the statute and the regulation, petitioner was informed that she could not apply for supervised home release. The court held that the regulation was the equivalent of a &quot;statute&quot; for the purpose of determining whether it violated the ex post facto prohibitions. A ruling as to the statute had equal application to the regulation. The amendment of the Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 18-100(b) was held to be retroactive, which satisfied the first prong of the test to determine whether a criminal law was ex post facto. Petitioner did not satisfy the second prong. The statute did not increase the punishment for which petitioner was eligible but merely affected her placement while serving those sentences. Therefore, &sect; 18-100(b) and the regulation did not violate the ex post facto prohibition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the husband's marriage was dissolved, he was ordered to pay plaintiff former wife the sum of $ 500 per week as unallocated alimony and support. The husband's subsequent motions seeking a modification were denied, and the magistrate found an arrearage in lump sum alimony. Ultimately, the magistrate ordered the husband incarcerated until he purged himself of contempt by paying the sum of $ 7,600. The court affirmed the decision. Specifically, the court held that the magistrate, having heard both the motion for contempt and the husband's motion for modification, knew the nature of the husband's business and whether the husband had the ability to purge himself of the arrearage. Furthermore, the court found that there was no constitutional prohibition to imprisoning the husband for failure to meet certain obligations arising from his marital relationship. Finally, the court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46b-231(m)(7) was not unconstitutional because the appeal procedure to the superior court, as provided by Conn. Gen. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46b-231(n), resulted in no loss of jurisdiction of the superior court to a &quot;lower court.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution relied on two expert witnesses and three friends of the petitioner to show that the petitioner shot a victim while the two were sitting in an a car. The petitioner's defense was that he was too intoxicated to form the intent to commit the crime, and the victim committed suicide. The petition alleged that trial counsel did not preserve a record of the trial court's ruling allowing a defense witness to invoke a privilege to remain silent. The court found that a complete record was made outside the presence of the jury, and that the petitioner was counseled by his attorney and had input into the decision whether or not to call the witness. With regard to petitioner's complaint that the trial counsel took no exception to the trial court's instruction on intoxication, the court found that the instruction was complete and fairly stated the law. On the petitioner's claim that he was denied his right to testify, the court found that he did not show that the result would have been different if he had testified, and the claim was not credible. Finally, the petitioner's claim that counsel did not investigate or produce evidence of the victim's mental state were meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff communications companies appealed a final decision of defendant, the Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) (Connecticut), which ruled that the communications companies violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-47 by not obtaining prior approval of a transaction transferring ownership and control of one of the companies to the other three. The DPUC imposed a fine upon the companies for this violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DPUC was the state regulatory agency charged with the regulation and supervision of community antenna television companies. The companies filed an application for the approval of the DPUC for three of the companies to acquire control over another company. Several months later, the companies informed the DPUC that the transaction had taken place and ownership had been transferred, but that control was not transferred, pending approval of the transaction by the DPUC. The DPUC found that the transaction was beneficial and approved it; however, it fined the companies for willfully violating &sect; 16-47(a) by not obtaining its approval prior to the transaction. The court found substantial evidence in the record to support the DPUC's conclusion that control of the company had passed with the ownership prior to approval by the DPUC. As such, the DPUC's finding that the companies violated &sect; 16-47 was supported by substantial evidence and had to be upheld. However, as to the company who transferred its control, because it had taken no action to become a holding company without the permission of the DPUC, the DPUC's finding that it had violated &sect; 16-47 was clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the DPUC's decision as to the company whose ownership and control was transferred to the other companies and affirmed the DPUC's decision finding that the other companies had violated the applicable statute. The matter was remanded for a recalculation of the fine imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought a special exception pursuant to Bridgeport, Conn., Zoning Regs. ch. 8. The owner sought to build a three-story woodframe apartment house containing 12 units that was to be combined with an existing three-unit structure on the adjoining lot for purposes of management and parking facilities. The Commission denied the owner's application, claiming overintensification of use. The owner appealed the Commission's decision on several grounds, and the court sustained the appeal. Specifically, the court held that where the owner had complied with all the ascertainable regulations and standards applicable to his application, and the record failed to show that his application violated any zoning regulations, the Commission erred in making a finding of overintensification. Finally, the court found that the Bridgeport, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 8(2)(c), when applied as standards for the granting of a special permit, did not pass the constitutional test necessitating ascertainable standards. As such, &sect; 8(2)(c) was not a basis for denying the application for a special exception.</SPAN></P>

The owners filed an application with the Zoning Board requesting a variance from the minimum rear yard setback, the minimum floor area ratio, and the non-infringement buffer requirements. After conducting a public hearing, the Zoning Board voted unanimously to reject the owners' request for a variance. The court sustained the owners' subsequent appeal. Specifically, the court held that the owners' request to vary the floor area ratio imposed no greater threat to the public health, safety, and welfare than the substantially smaller home would have done. Furthermore, the court found that such a variance would permit a home the size of which would be in harmony with the neighboring homes; as such, the court found that the Zoning Board acted arbitrarily in denying the variance. In addition, the court found that the non-infringement area completely covered the owners' lot and that the Zoning Board's failure to vary its application to the subject lot amounted to &quot;practical confiscation.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Although the father filed his petition within three years of filing the acknowledgment, he was not entitled to vacate the judgment pursuant to Conn. Gen.

Before signing the acknowledgment, the father signed a document clearly informing him of the ramifications of signing the acknowledgment and of rights to decline to sign, to have a trial, and to be represented by an attorney before signing. The father appeared in court with an attorney within two months of signing the acknowledgment for a hearing on support. Thus the father's due process rights were not violated.

A bond was substituted for the lien. Defendant mortgagor stipulated to the amount owing for services performed by the lienholder and ceased defending the action. Defendants, a mortgagee and a surety, argued in part that the lien was invalid and that the lienholder's agreement to discharge the mortgagee on the bond released the surety as well.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagor failed to pay the lienholder the full amount it owed to the lienholder for building condominiums on its property. The lienholder filed a mechanic's lien and gave notice to the mortgagor, but not the mortgagee. Even though the lienholder sought to foreclose on his lien more than one year after his mechanic's lien was perfected, the lienholder never recorded a notice of lis pendens. Upon review, the court concluded that the lien was invalid because: (1) the mechanic's lien certificate was not executed under oath pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-34(1)(C); (2) the mortgagee held legal title to the property and was never served with a true and attested copy of the mechanic's lien certificate as required by &sect; 49-34; and (3) the lienholder failed to meet the requirements of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 49-39, 49-40a by filing a lis pendens within one year after his lien was perfected. The court found the remaining arguments as to waiver and quantum meruit by defendants unavailing. The court concluded that the lienholder's agreement to release the mortgagee on the bond if it were successful did not release the surety from liability.</SPAN></P>

The court held the measure of damages as contended for by the plaintiffs should have been the measure utilized, and the measure was not at all unreasonable or inequitable or unjust.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Paternity had been established for a child when the father acknowledged paternity of the child. The father returned to the court and filed a petition to request that the prior adjudication of paternity be set aside based on new evidence that he was not the father. The state income maintenance department (department) filed special defenses to the petition including the special defense of statute of limitations. The department filed motion for summary judgment based on the special defense of statute of limitations. The court noted that summary judgment could be granted based on the statute of limitations if the pleadings, affidavits, and other proof submitted with the motion showed no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court held that the department was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because the petition for a new trial was not commenced by the father within 3 years after the paternity judgment as required by both Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-172(b) and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-582. The motion for summary judgment was granted.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties stipulated that a police officer had probable cause to arrest the driver for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, but disagreed as to whether the driver had a blood alcohol count of .10 percent or more. The driver was wobbling and did not cooperate in the police officer's effort to conduct field sobriety tests. Later breathalyzer tests indicated readings of .165 and .142. The motor vehicle department's hearing officer found sufficient evidence that at the time of the offense the driver had a blood alcohol count of .10 or more and ordered a suspension of the driver's motor vehicle operator's license for a period of 90 days pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b. The driver appealed, contending that the hearing officer's decision was clearly erroneous and was illegal, arbitrary, and an abuse of discretion. The court dismissed the appeal, noting that the hearing officer considered expert testimony about the unreliability of the test results as to the tests given to the driver, but did not accept the expert's opinion. The court dismissed the driver's claim that the per se operator's license revocation statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the citizen failed to state a claim for inadequate protection because there were insufficient facts showing that the police had a policy or custom of affording inadequate police protection. Second, the court held that the citizen failed to allege sufficient facts to hold the police chief personally liable. The citizen failed to allege that the police chief was grossly negligent in managing the police officers. In addition, the court held that the citizen failed to state a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1985(3) because the citizen did not allege a conspiracy. Third, the court held that the police officers and the police chief enjoyed immunity because the allegations that the police officers ignored his complaints did not give rise to malice, wantonness, or intent to injure.</SPAN></P>

In his appeal, the driver alleged that the police officer's report was not properly sworn to as required by Conn. Gen.

The court found no error and dismissed the appeal. The court held that the police officer's report met the requirements of &sect; 14-227b(c) because there was no requirement in Conn. Gen.

The court dismissed defendants' counterclaims and granted the Commissioner's motion to strike. The court held that defendants' allegations of a conspiracy and a property deprivation did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation, that defendants did not present their monetary claims to the claims commissioner, that defendants did not allege an exception to the State's sovereign immunity, and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over defendants' counterclaims. The court also held that defendants failed to allege sufficient facts to state a defense of res judicata, that defendants failed to contest a prior order requiring a permit for the site, that defendants did not rely on statements prior to the order, and that the Commissioner was entitled to strike defendants' special defense.</SPAN></P>

Even if the police officer did not submit the driver's license with his report as required by &sect; 14-228b(c) and Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 14-227b-19, that did not render the suspension void. The driver had a reasonable opportunity to contact an attorney. Further, giving an accused the opportunity to contact an attorney was not a prerequisite to a license suspension.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' application for a building permit was denied by a zoning enforcement officer. Specifically, the application was denied because of Wallingford, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 6.3B, which mandated that building permits were not issued unless a street giving access to the lot in question had been accepted by the town. The road giving access to the owners' land was unpaved in part. The decision was then submitted to the Board, which determined that only the paved portion of the road had been accepted. After the officer's decision was sustained by the Board, the owners sought review. The owners contended that &sect; 6.3B was confiscatory. In dismissing the appeal, the court determined that there was no dedication or acceptance of the road in question. The mere fact that the road was included on a map was not determinative of dedication. Moreover, the fact that some of the road had been accepted did not necessarily mean that the entire road had been accepted. Because there was substantial evidence in the record to sustain the Board's findings concerning the acceptance of the road, its decision was not arbitrary, illegal, or an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The collision occurred after the prior version of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295 was declared unconstitutional, but before enactment of the later version in 1988 Conn. Acts 229. 1988 Conn. Acts 229 was silent as to whether it was prospective or retrospective. The court held there were substantial and significant differences between the new statute and its predecessor. 1988 Conn. Acts 229 gave the factfinder the authority to assess multiple damages. Moreover, the act eliminated three, and added eight new, trigger statutes. The act also required the injured party to allege that the alleged tortfeasor defendant &quot;deliberately&quot; or &quot;with reckless disregard&quot; violated the particular trigger statute and that the violation was a &quot;substantial factor&quot; causing the injury. Those were substantive changes. The statute under which the injured party made the claim was substantive and could not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners applied to the Commission to build a house and a septic system entirely within the regulated area beyond the wetland boundary. The Commission held two public hearings. At some time between the two hearings, some members of the Commission visited the site and gathered evidence for themselves. The landowners' application was denied on the basis of the closeness of the abutting neighbors' well to the proposed septic location and the proximity of the stream. The landowners appealed. The court dismissed the appeal finding that, in light of the opportunity the landowners had to learn of and counter the question of the location of the neighbors' well, there was no deprivation of due process in what otherwise might have been an inappropriate procedure by the Commission in visiting the site. The court concluded there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the reasons for the Commission's decision and its decision was sufficiently related to it's appropriate functions under the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-37. The court found there was no taking because the statute did not restrict the use of the property for any reasonable purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developers sought review of a decision by defendant town planning and zoning commission (PZC) (Connecticut). Both developers had filed applications with the PZC: one was for a subdivision, and the other for a resubdivision. The developers contended that denial of their applications were not supported by the record, that the PZC's actions were confiscatory, and that the denials were based on evidence received outside the public hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One developer filed an application for the approval of a 41-lot subdivision. The other developer filed an application for a resubdivision of an existing abutting lot into three parcels. The court noted that the developers were related companies and that the applications were inseparable and interdependent; therefore, the court dealt with them as such. The court denied both appeals and held that the developers had failed to establish that the PZC had acted improperly. The court held that there was substantial evidence in the record that reasonably supported the PZC's denial of the requested waiver to extend the roadway because the waiver would have a significant adverse impact on public safety. The court held that a letter received by the PZC from an attorney explaining the reasons that a block length waiver regulation was included in the regulations was, at most, harmless error because the PZC's actions were supported by evidence adduced at the public hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' property was partially located on wetlands. The owners filed an application to excavate and remove material for a house and a driveway, to construct the house and driveway, and to fill and grade for the house and driveway. The commission denied the application, finding that the plan would significantly impact the wetlands. The owners appealed, alleging that the denial of application constituted an unconstitutional taking of their property. The court dismissed the appeal. The court found that the owners were aggrieved for purposes of taking an appeal. The court held that the owners were not entitled to a permit because there was no finding by the commission that no feasible of prudent alternatives existed as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-41(b). The court found that there were alternatives to the issuance of a permit. Because the property adjoined another lot belonging to the owners, the two lots could be combined for development purposes and the proposed house location could be shifted to the other lot. The court held that the burden of proving potential alternatives rested on the owners and not the commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff developer, a limited partnership, appealed a decision by defendant Cheshire Planning and Zoning Commission (Connecticut), which, based on an amendment to Cheshire, Conn., Interchange Zone Regulations &sect; 48.2, denied the developer's application for a special permit to construct a regional shopping center at the interchange of two major highways. The areas of law included whether the amendment exceeded the Commission's authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer argued, inter alia, that the amendment exceeded the Commission's authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-3 in that it violated the uniformity requirement of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2. The developer also argued that the amendment was unsupported by the record, was inconsistent with the comprehensive plan of the Town of Cheshire, Connecticut, constituted spot zoning, and violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court held that, given the Commission's consideration of the potential traffic congestion, the environmental impact, the protection from individuals bent on a criminal purpose, the Commission's original intent to allow only one shopping center in the interchange, the size of regional shopping centers, the town's comprehensive plan, and the uniformity requirement of &sect; 8-2, the Commission did not exceed its authority under &sect; 8-3 in approving the amendment. The amendment did not constitute spot zoning. The court held that the amendment was reasonably related to the police power purposes enumerated in &sect; 8-2.

The executrix, who was also an estate beneficiary, appealed and stated she was aggrieved by the Probate Court order. The beneficiaries moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Book &sect; 194 reasons of appeal on October 10, 1990, and the beneficiaries appeared on September 7, 1990, and moved to dismiss on January 16, 1991. The trial court stated that, under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 142, as the beneficiaries did not file their motion to dismiss within 30 days of the appearance, they waived any claim of lack of jurisdiction due to insufficiency of process. But, a claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction could be raised any time and could not be waived. The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction, in part, because the executrix complied with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-186 (former Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45-288); the executrix's motion for appeal contained her interest in the Probate Court's order or the estate, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45a-191 (former Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 45-293) and her adverse effect; the executrix alleged the possibility of her aggrievement--her standing. The trial court had subject matter jurisdiction, even if the executrix's notice of appeal did not name an adverse party. The trial court could proceed with the appeal after all adverse parties were noticed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 7-147i. The court determined that the lack of a filing date on the application itself did not mean that the record was incomplete under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8(k)(1), which would have prevented the court from hearing the appeal. The court held that an evaluation of the record determined that time between the date of the application and the date the commission rendered its decision was more than 65 days, and under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-147e(b), the application was approved by operation of law because of that failure.</SPAN></P>

The inmate, who was a black male, argued his race was substantially underrepresented. The inmate further asserted that his right to the effective assistance of counsel was violated in that his trial counsel failed to investigate adequately and inform him of the viability of a constitutional challenge to the racial composition of the grand jury array or to the selection method used to compile his grand jury. After a hearing, the court dismissed the inmate's petition. The court held that the inmate's plea of guilty had foreclosed independent inquiry into his grand jury selection claim. The court ruled that the guilty plea represented a break in the chain of events, which had preceded it in the criminal process. The court further stated that when a criminal defendant has solemnly admitted in open court that he was in fact guilty of the offense with which he was charged, he could not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning commission stated that the special permit application was denied because it did not comply with the applicable sections of the zoning regulations. The zoning commission stated that the granting the special permit would have had adverse impacts on the nearby local roads and intersection, would cause additional increase in noise, artificial lighting and fumes from the parking lots located in close proximity to the existing residential dwelling, and the proposed screening and buffering of the project was inadequate to provide the desired separation. The court stated that the matters did not contain technically complex issues that would require the zoning commission to rely on experts. Because the matters were within the zoning commission's own knowledge, the zoning commission was not bound to adopt the opinions of the developer's experts. The developer was also unable to show that the zoning commission had already predetermination the denial of the special permit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner, a black male who pled guilty to an indictment charging him with murder, petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus claiming that his federal and state constitutional rights had been violated because (1) members of his race were substantially underrepresented on the grand jury that indicted him, and (2) his counsel's failure to challenge the racial composition of the array constituted ineffective representation of counsel. The court dismissed the petition. The prisoner's claim that the court lacked jurisdiction to try him because the disproportionate racial balance of the array invalidated the indictment lacked merit because the defect, if any, could have been corrected by a new indictment by a properly selected grand jury. Accordingly, the prisoner's claim arising out of the grand jury selection procedure was a nonjurisdictional defect and was waived by his plea. Considering that prior challenges the method of grand jury selection had been unsuccessful, and presuming that counsel rendered adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment, counsel's failure to raise a grand jury selection claim was reasonable under prevailing professional norms.</SPAN></P>

He further claimed that he was denied his right to the effective assistance of counsel. After a hearing, the court dismissed the petition. The court held that the inmate failed to prove a substantial degree underrepresentation. The court found that the inmate did not present any evidence as to the actual number of observed blacks on any grand jury over any period of time. The court further concluded that the inmate did not present any statistical evidence of two or three standard deviations regarding either the expected number of blacks in the array under the town quota system or under a tolerable range of expected blacks. The court ruled, therefore, that the inmate failed to prove an equal protection violation under the federal or state constitutions. The court further held that the inmate failed to prove prejudice from any failure by his trial counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate, a black male, convicted and sentenced for murder, in volition of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54a, petitioned for habeas relief, claiming that he was illegally confined, that his rights to effective assistance of counsel and equal protection under the federal and state constitutions were violated, when he was indicted by a grand jury in which members of his race were substantially underrepresented due to the selection procedure used.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State argued that petitioner's claim was unpreserved and that the &quot;cause and prejudice&quot; standard, rather than the &quot;bypass standard,&quot; should be used to justify petitioner's failure to pursue a timely challenge to the grand jury array. The court, stating that the deliberate bypass test was the appropriate standard, concluded that there had not been a deliberate bypass of the orderly procedure of direct appeal by petitioner of his grand jury claim because there was no evidence that petitioner knew that he could raise a grand jury claim or that he had consented to the decision not to raise such a claim. With respect to the equal protection claim, petitioner claimed that the jury array selection procedure mandated by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-220 was not racially neutral and resulted in substantial under-representation of members of his race. The court stated that petitioner had failed to prove a substantial degree of underrepresentation and, therefore, failed to show an equal protection violation. With respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the court stated that petitioner failed to prove that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance under the Strickland standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town authorized construction of a sewage system in certain areas of the town, including the vicinity of the subject property. A sewer easement was obtained by condemnation along the southern boundary of the partnership's property. In accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-257, the subject property was connected with the sewer. The WPCA then levied sewer benefit assessments under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-249 on properties having access to the sewer. The partnership challenged the amount of its assessment. The court found that there was no merit to the partnership's claim that the WPCA unfairly assessed undeveloped properties at too high a rate and developed properties at too low a rate. The partnership only had standing to challenge whether its property received too high an assessment, not whether someone else's assessment was too low. The court found that the value of the partnership's parcel after installation of the sewers was $ 3 million. There was sufficient data to value the subject property using the market sales approach. However, the court found that the assessment of the property should have been $ 336,000 rather than $ 488,700.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sellers voluntarily agreed to the court's reference of the case to a referee. The report found the sellers had breached the contract and recommended that the purchaser be granted specific performance.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-183b. The court held that the sellers were afforded due process where they were given an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and manner to present their claims and defenses. The sellers' equal protection rights were not violated by the procedures in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-434(a)(4) because they bore a reasonable relationship to the legitimate governmental purpose of alleviating court congestion and because the sellers failed to allege any specific injury attributable to the length of time required for submission of the referee's report.

Furthermore, the court found that the Commission's decision was not so unreasonable as to constitute an arbitrary exercise of police power because the Commission's desire to have zone boundaries readily ascertainable was a rational objective. Finally, the court concluded that the owners failed to prove that the economic utilization of their property had been destroyed by the rezoning, thus, their claim of unconstitutional taking was rejected.</SPAN></P>

The application was denied because the open land proposal was inadequate due to an insufficiency of dry land. The developer appealed. On review, the court sustained the appeal. The court held that the planning commission, acting in its administrative capacity, had no discretion or choice but to approve a subdivision if it conformed to the regulations adopted for its guidance. If it did not conform as required, the plan might be disapproved. Under Lebanon, Conn., Subdivision Regs. &sect; 6.8A, the planning commission could require the dedication of open space land in any subdivision when it felt that the dedication of the land would protect natural, scenic, historical and/or recreational values. However, there was no requirement that the open space consists of only dry land nor that the land to be dedicated be contained within a residentially zoned area. The court determined that denial of the developer's application pursuant to &sect; 6.8A was arbitrary. The court further determined that the developer's application should have been approved because the developer complied with the open space requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, an abutting landowner and two other individuals, appealed pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8 from a decision of defendant, the Planning and Zoning Board of Milford (Connecticut), which granted a zone change from general industrial (GI) to general business (GB) use sought by defendant applicants. The use had been allowed under a previously approved site plan, based on a mistaken assumption as to the property's zone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicants had previously obtained site plan approval to construct a building consisting of mixed residential and retail uses, but the applicants and the board at the time incorrectly assumed that the property was zoned GB rather than GI. The zone change was done to validate the existing use. There was a public notice of the site plan approval, but no hearing. The abutting landowners appeared at a hearing in opposition to the zone change. At a subsequent meeting, for which the abutting owners did not receive notice, the applicant's attorney addressed the board's concern regarding compliance with the site plan, after which the zone change was approved. On review, the court sustained the appeal. While only one abutting owner was aggrieved under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8, the court found that fact sufficient to establish jurisdiction. The court held that the board had not been required to hold a public hearing on the site plan and had authority to correct a prior mistake. However, the court found that the compliance with that plan was material to approval; thus, post-hearing statements by the applicant's attorney should not have been received without an opportunity for rebuttal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff driver filed an appeal pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183 of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-166 et seq., from a decision of defendant, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles (Connecticut) ordering the suspension of his motor vehicle operator's license pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b, as amended by 1989 Conn. Acts 89-314, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the suspension hearing, a report by the arresting officer was admitted over the driver's objection. The report stated that the officer made an investigatory stop after he observed the driver's vehicle weaving, admitted to drinking three beers, and failed field sobriety tests. The report then stated the driver was arrested and administered a test indicating a blood alcohol count (BAC) above .10 percent. Based on the report, the commissioner found probable cause for arrest, arrest, a BAC over .10, and operation of a vehicle, thus suspended pursuant to &sect; 14-227(f). On appeal, the court upheld the suspension, finding no abuse of discretion. The court noted that the commissioner was not strictly bound by the rules of evidence, and held that the officer's report met the requirements of &sect; 14-227b(c), thus was admissible under Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 14-227b-19. The court held that the suspension procedure under &sect; 14-227 did not deprive the driver of his constitutional right to confront witnesses, because the driver was entitled to secure the officer's appearance, but failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner appealed the judgment by a referee, requesting a reassessment of the damages awarded for the taking of his property for highway purposes by defendant, the Commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Transportation (Commissioner).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner challenged the judgment entered, claiming that the damages assessed were inadequate. The instant court agreed. The court had the benefit of appraisal reports and testimony from two expert appraisers, both of whom reached their conclusions as to values in large measure by resort to comparable sales. The evidence revealed that the taking denied the rights of access to some degree; that two slope easements were taken; and that the property was now divided into three segments rendering residential development somewhat more difficult. Despite the assertion by the Commissioner, that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 13a-77 was unconstitutional, in that it provided an award of costs, if an appellant obtained an award from the court greater than that awarded by the Commissioner, a judgment could be awarded in favor of the landowner according to his request. Thus, the statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner was allowed an additional sum in damages, interest, and an allowance toward an appraiser's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claiming sovereign immunity and that the counterclaim did not arise from the same cause of action as the Commissioner's suit, the Commissioner sought to dismiss the counterclaim. The operators contended that the Commissioner's actions and inactions estopped her from enforcing Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-208a, and that she was guilty of selective enforcement. The court granted the Commissioner's motion to dismiss, finding that waiver was a special defense that had to be specially pleaded and that was not a proper subject for a counterclaim. The court also noted that the operators did not allege that the Commissioner made any affirmative statements that rose to the level of a valid waiver or estoppel defense, and that the counterclaim for a finding of no damages did not arise from the enforcement action. The court further held that there was no basis for an exception to sovereign immunity because the operators did not allege that the Commissioner violated a constitutional right or exceeded her statutory authority, noting that precedent showed that the conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement was not in itself a federal constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the administrator of a prisoner's estate, filed a wrongful death action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1983, 1988 against defendants, the State of Connecticut, various state officials as John Does, the prison warden, and the past and current Commissioners of Correction. The state attorney general answered and filed motions to dismiss on behalf of all defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner died because his asthmatic condition was untreated by the prison. The administrator filed suit. The State answered and filed motions to dismiss. The court dismissed the complaint in part. The attorney general had authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-141d to represent defendants in their official and individual capacities, but the court lacked jurisdiction over the John Doe defendants because naming John Doe defendants was improper practice and there was no fictitious name statute. Therefore, all claims against the John Doe defendants were dismissed. The warden and commissioners waived their right to claim a lack of personal jurisdiction by failure to file the claim within 30 days as required by Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 142 and by filing an answer. Because the Claims Commissioner had not authorized the suit, sovereign immunity barred the action for monetary relief against the State and against the warden and commissioners in their official capacities. However, there was no bar to the action against the warden and commissioners in their individual capacities under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because the complaint alleged deliberate indifference.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the administrator's actions against the John Doe defendants, the State, and the remaining defendants in their official capacities.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicants appealed from a decision of the planning and zoning commission (Connecticut), which denied their application for permission to construct a single-family residence on two lots, which they purchased after a denial of a prior site plan application by the previous owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two lots adjoined the applicants' residential lot and were pre-existing non-conforming lots, which were located on a sound and were, consequently, regulated by the Coastal Area Management Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22a-90 et seq. The reasons for denial focused on pollution created by the proposed septic system. On appeal, the applicants alleged that the commission's denial was illegal, arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of its discretion, as its reasons were overly broad and general. They also contended that the denial resulted in a taking of their property without just compensation. The court found that the commission's reasons were supported by the record and that the denial did not result in a taking, where it did not deprive all reasonable and proper use of the lots or so diminish their value as to constitute its confiscation. The court noted that the applicants purchased the lots knowing that they were not deemed buildable and that they continued to enjoy use of the lots as a private beach and as a view enhancer. Furthermore, the court concluded that the public benefit derived from protecting the coastal waters outweighed any claimed diminution in value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant, a black man, was denied admission to the Connecticut Bar.

Chapter 814c of Conn. Gen.

The applicant failed to exhaust the administrative procedure and obtain his remedies under the statute before petitioning the court. In order to comply with the exhaustion rule, the applicant was required to obtain an order from the CHRO and, if he was aggrieved, appeal from the order to the court pursuant to Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner filed a motion to strike a special defense by defendant zoning board that a portion of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-8, which allowed this administrative appeal, was unconstitutional. The board claimed that the portion of &sect; 8-8 conferring automatic standing to take an appeal on any person owning land that abutted land involved in a decision of the board was unconstitutional because it infringed on the power of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board contended that statutory aggrievement was an unconstitutional interference by the legislature with the judicial power vested in the courts under the separation of powers doctrine. It also contended that the legislature could not confer standing by statute and create justiciability for a person otherwise not aggrieved. The court found that, in order to decide the property owners' motion to strike, it must decide the legal sufficiency of the special defense, which in turn required the court to decide a constitutional question. In such a case, it would usually be appropriate for the court to deny or postpone a ruling on the motion to strike if, for example, the co-defendant had filed the motion to strike. Here, however, the motion was filed by the board, a municipal agency which had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of statutes passed by the state legislature. No matter what the evidence would have been at trial, the board could not assert the special defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A coordinate judge of the court had granted defendants' previous motion to strike plaintiffs' request for multiple damages in their original complaint. In plaintiffs' amended complaint, they again sought multiple damages pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295, alleging that defendant driver recklessly operated his vehicle in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-240a. The court granted defendants' motion to strike the claim for multiple damages. Former Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295, the statute in effect at the time of the accident, was later declared unconstitutional and was thus unenforceable. 1988 Conn. Acts 229, the current Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295, went into effect after plaintiffs' cause of action arose. Because 1988 Conn. Acts 229 affected the substantive rights of litigants, it could not be retrospectively applied. Even though plaintiffs were praying for multiple damages in reference to a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-240a, the actual basis for the claim of relief remained, as before, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295. Finally, denying the motion to strike would amount to an inappropriate modification of the prior ruling of the coordinate judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve a record of the unconstitutional restriction of the voir dire by not allowing counsel to inquire of prospective jurors whether they would attach more credibility to the testimony of a police officer than any other witness. Even assuming that trial counsel acquiesced to an admonishment not to question venire persons as to whether they would attach more credibility to an officer's testimony, the court observed that there was no per se error standard for the disallowance of a particular question during voir dire. In denying the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, the court stated that it heard no evidence that but for the counsel's unprofessional errors the result would have been different. Moreover, the court added, the case was not decided on the testimony of police officers but on the testimony of the victim. The record revealed no restriction on the voir dire, a conclusion supported by counsel's inability to recall any direct admonition by the judge. Finally, the jury was properly instructed that no special weight should be given testimony of an officer just because of his status.</SPAN></P>

The Board filed a motion to dismiss the purchaser's action, claiming that because the contractor had filed a second application for a building permit, the action was moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contract purchaser bought 1.04 acres of land and filed an application for a building permit so he could construct a single-family residence on the land. The land was located in a floodplain, and the purchaser proposed to deposit fill in a river and to build the house in a wetlands area. The staff of the Environmental Protection Board of the City of Stamford (Connecticut) asked the purchaser to provide more information to support his application; while that information was being gathered, the legislature amended Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-40 to revoke a property owner's right to build a home in a wetland area unless the owner had a building permit issued on or before July 1, 1987. Following hearings, the Board denied the purchaser's application. The trial court held that (1) the purchaser had standing to appeal the Board's decision and his action was not moot; (2) the amended version of &sect; 22a-40 controlled resolution of the case and under that version, the purchaser's lot lost its as-of-right status for construction of a home on July 1, 1987; and (3) the Board's action did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of property for public use without compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the Board's motion to dismiss the contract purchaser's action as moot, but dismissed the purchaser's action because it found that the Board had not acted illegally, arbitrarily, or in abuse of its discretion.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 47a-42.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Eight tenants who had been evicted from property located in the City of Stamford (Connecticut) sued the city and city officials, alleging that city officials failed to provide adequate notice, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 47a-42, of what would happen to tenants' property after it was removed from rented premises, with the result that on many occasions a tenant's property was destroyed before the tenant had an opportunity to reclaim it, and that &sect; 47a-42 violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The trial court held that (1) Conn. Gen.

The court held, however, that state law did not require the city to base sewer charges on actual water usage, but only to consider such usage as one of several factors in determining sewer use charges. Further, the board was permitted to charge the same rate even though different properties discharged different volumes of water into the sewerage system, since there was no available data on the amount of water actually discharged into the system. Finally, while the city sewer charge ordinances were not models of clarity or precision, the board complied with its obligation under the ordinances to make proportional distribution of the costs of operating the sewer system among its users, but allowing for a minimum charge for each user of the system.</SPAN></P>

The superior court noted first that it found no evidence from which it could conclude that the first selectman was not an acting member of the Commission without a vote. Thus, the landowners' claim that the Commission was without authority to act was without merit. The court next examined the question of aggrievement of the landowners. As for the land association, the court found that it had no specific, personal, or legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest; therefore, it was not aggrieved. As for the two named individual landowners, the superior court found that the first individual was not aggrieved, as his property was no affected by the amendment in any injurious manner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff restaurant brought suit in the trial court (Connecticut) against the Town of Westport, the Representative Town Meeting of the Town of Westport (RTM), and the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Westport (PZC) seeking declaratory judgments and a writ of mandamus to the PZC to execute the &quot;Certificate of Zoning Authority&quot; required by the state liquor control commission for the issuance of a liquor license for the restaurant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant claimed that the RTM's action in voiding the amendment to the 1,500 foot restriction passed by the PZC precluded his ability to obtain a liquor license. The appellate court rejected the claim that the RTM's action violated Town of Westport, Conn., Charter &sect; C26-4.A. The request to review the PZC action was filed the day the action was taken, and was not premature. The claim that the RTM action was ineffective for failure of the town clerk to publish the action of the RTM in accordance with Town of Westport, Conn., Charter &sect; C5-9.A was also rejected. The Westport Charter contained no publication requirement when the RTM acted on a regulation of the PZC. The statement in Town of Westport, Conn., Charter &sect; C4-6 that the rejected regulation was void indicated an intent to have an immediate effect, without a resort to a municipal referendum. The claim that the restaurant's due process rights were violated was rejected as there was no constitutional right to obtain a liquor license. The delegation of the power of review to the RTM was in general terms, which was permissible, and was not constitutionally invalid. The appellate court refused to grant a writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The request for declaratory relief was denied. The request for a writ of mandamus was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the Wallingford Planning and Zoning Commission (Connecticut) and others, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6(3), amended its zoning regulations to restrict the power of plaintiffs, the Wallingford Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) and others, in granting use variances within the town. Thereafter, the ZBA filed an appeal from the adoption of the amended Wallingford, Conn., Zoning Reg. &sect; 9.1.H.2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that plaintiffs had no standing to take the appeal and alternatively that the zoning regulation in question was a valid exercise of their power under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6(3). Plaintiffs claimed that the new regulation was a complete and wholesale destruction of their power to grant variances for unusual hardship or exceptional difficulty. The issue, therefore, was whether the amendment in question, because it permitted the grant of a variance only in cases where the refusal to grant it would result in an unconstitutional taking, was a wholesale destruction of the ZBA's right to grant variances. The court found that plaintiffs were aggrieved parties who had the right to appeal the adoption of the regulation. In addition, the court concluded that the present regulation completely eviscerated the power of the ZBA from granting variances under the commonly understood criteria set forth within Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6 and substituted the concept of unconstitutional taking for exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship. This defendants could not do. In enacting the instant amendment to Wallingford, Conn., Zoning Reg. &sect; 9.1.H.2, defendants acted beyond their power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was sustained and the amendment was declared invalid and unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff abutting landowner appealed a decision of defendant City Planning Commission of the City of Waterbury (Connecticut), which approved a subdivision application that included a dead end road 1,295 feet in length although the City of Waterbury, Ct., Land Subdivision Regulation &sect; 5.6 set the maximum length for dead end roads at 750 feet.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City of Waterbury, Ct., Land Subdivision Regulation &sect; 5.6 provided that dead end streets would be approved by the Commission only when, among other things, the street did not exceed 750 feet in length. The regulation also allowed the Commission to approve longer dead end streets. In sustaining the appeal, the court held that the simultaneous approval of the subdivision and the over-long street was improper, as a waiver of the length restriction should have preceded the approval of the subdivision. Moreover, however, the court held that the length restriction could not be waived under the regulation, because there was no guidance provided for the circumstances in which the waiver could be made. The court held that this gave the Commission unbridled discretion, which was contrary to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-26, which required that the regulations had to specify the circumstances in which a waiver could be granted. The court observed that subdivision regulations had to contain known and fixed standards applying to all cases of a like nature, and had to conform to the principle that a regulation, like a statute, could not be too general in its terms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court sustained the abutting landowner's appeal and ordered the Commission to reverse its decision and deny approval to the subdivision application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the owner and operator of a food processing and distribution facility, appealed from a decision of defendant Zoning Board of Appeals of the Town of East Granby (Connecticut), which denied the owner's appeal from an order of a zoning enforcement officer which required the owner to comply with the noise control provisions of a town zoning regulation. The Board filed a motion in limine to deny any evidence outside the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board in its decision found that there were incidents of noise levels from the owner's facility that exceeded the standards of the zoning regulation and the owner therefore failed to comply with the regulation. The owner appealed on the grounds including that the zoning regulation was not filed in the office of the town clerk for public inspection at least 10 days before the public hearing as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-3. In granting the Board's motion in limine and dismissing the appeal, the court held that a declaratory judgment was the appropriate remedy for the owner's challenge to the validity of the zoning regulation under &sect; 8-3. The court stated that where a party contested the very validity of the regulation, relief under it would be inadequate or futile. Declaratory judgment was also the remedy for the owner's contention that the zoning regulation conflicted with existing state regulations. Further, the owner could not appeal to the Board on the ground that the zoning enforcement officer did not have sufficient evidence under the regulation to order the owner to cease and desist and at the same time attack the constitutionality of his power to act thereunder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A developer cited bias as to the denials of his applications. The court dismissed each of the appeals, reasoning that the record supported the reasons for denying the applications. The court found that the IWC stated that not all of the required information was provided and expressed concern as to the environmental impact and the high risk of significant damage from moving the wetlands and from building the proposed townhouses. The court also rejected the claim of bias by the IWC chairman because an alleged bet as to the outcome of the developer's application was shown to be a mere joke and there was no evidence of corruption. It was further determined that the area's ecology could not have supported the desired zone change, which would have constituted spot zoning. The court also concluded that the record and the law supported the following reasons for rejecting the special exception, which included: an increased traffic and safety risk, the project's high unit density, and the incomplete data as to the project-related activity. Further, a biased PZC member's participation in the matter did not invalidate the result because the required majority existed without his vote.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The opponents raised the defense of illegality, arbitrariness, and abuse of discretion. The court dismissed the opponents' appeal, concluding that the record supported the Board's action. The court concluded that the Board thoroughly considered the impact on traffic from the subject property's proposed use as a school, noting that a traffic impact study showed that that use would have had a negligible impact on the existing roadway network and would not have aggravated the existing traffic problems. The court also held that subjecting the special permit's grant on conditions that related to traffic and safety concerns was a valid use of the Board's statutory and regulatory power and that the finding that the condition that the school's buses remain on the subject property for the entire school day violated a regulation did not invalidate the grant because that condition was not integral to the approval's validity. The court further determined that requiring that some of the school-related traffic use a private road network was not a taking because an existing easement allowed for such use and there was no evidence that it diminished the affected property's value or usability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed suit against defendant seeking to recover damages for injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident. In her complaint, plaintiff sought double and treble damages under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295. Defendant moved to strike the prayer for relief for damages under &sect; 14-295, arguing that the statute had been declared unconstitutional because it allowed trial courts to interfere with and invade the fact finding function of juries by permitting trial courts to award multiple damages that the parties had a constitutional right to have determined by the trier of fact. Plaintiff contested the motion to strike, asserting that the new version of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295, which took effect in the form of Public Act 88-229, was retroactive in application. In granting the motion to strike, the court concluded that, because the new statute affected the substantive rights of the parties, it could not have retroactive application in the absence of clear intent. Because the statute contained no express language indicating its retrospective application, the act was prospective in application and precluded plaintiff's requested damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff muffler shops brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment based on a ruling of defendant labor commissioner that their employees were not exempt under Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the phrase &quot;commissions on goods and services&quot; was not so plain and unambiguous as to exclude from entitlement for overtime pay &quot;any employee&quot; who was paid on a commission basis and that it was therefore necessary and appropriate for the court to resort to principles of statutory construction to determine the legislative intent. The court held that the labor commissioner's ruling had to be interpreted as limited to compensation for sales, and that because more than half of the earnings of the muffler shops' employees were derived from the performance of services rather than sales the finding that the requirement had not been met, was correct. The employees were not exempt under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-76i(g) from the statutory requirements that the employer compensate its employees for overtime work. Further, &sect; 31-76i(g), as construed and applied by the labor department, was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The inmate did not tell his public defender that he might be unable to participate competently in consideration of plea bargains. The attorney advised the inmate to invoke the Alford doctrine rather than acknowledge a factual foundation of the offense to which the plea was to be entered because the inmate maintained that he had not had intent to sell the vials found on his person. The inmate was convicted and then sought a writ of habeas corpus on the grounds that he had been denied effective assistance in that he was not informed that there were other statutes applicable to drug dependent persons and that the attorney knew that the inmate was emotionally unstable yet failed to request psychiatric evaluation in connection with the plea. The court dismissed the petition, holding that the inmate failed to prove his claims of ineffective assistance because the inmate had been sufficiently advised of his options and exposure and knew the charge to which he had entered his plea at the time he entered it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer sought to purchase a lot from the property owner near wetlands and build a residence.

The agency denied the application, providing five reasons for denial, and plaintiffs sought review. The court ruled that the record supported the five reasons given by the agency for denial of the permit. The court held that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that no alternatives existed that had a less detrimental impact upon the wetland area. The court also held that the evidence including the testimony of neighboring property owners supported the agency's conclusion that the proposed activity would lead to permanent damage resulting in increased flooding and other irretrievable adverse effects. The court also held plaintiffs failed to provide adequate soil and erosion control measures, and that their engineer failed to present a biological evaluation and hydrological study.</SPAN></P>

The distributor filed an answer asserting counterclaims including abuse of process, slander of title, and unconstitutional deprivation. The court granted the redeemer's motion to strike all of the counterclaims. The court found that an action for abuse of process lay against any person using a legal process against another in an improper manner to accomplish a purpose for which it was not designed and that the distributor had failed to allege overt acts for a collateral purpose. The court found that the allegations in the distributor's counterclaim alleging slander of title were insufficient to support such a claim. Finally, the court found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278e, which allowed prejudgment remedy without a hearing, met the due process standards of both the Connecticut and federal constitutions. Although case law had determined that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-278(a)(1) was unconstitutional, that declaration had prospective effect and did not apply to the distributor's counterclaim; therefore, the court granted the redeemer's motion to strike that count of the distributor's counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1978, the putative father, without legal representation, signed an acknowledgement of paternity pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46b-172 on a form provided by a clerk, without being advised of the legal consequences. Subsequently, in Stone v. Mahar, 527 F. Supp. 10 (D.Conn.1980), it was held that such acknowledgments were ineffective waivers and &sect; 46b-172&nbsp;unconstitutionally deprived putative fathers of due process by allowing imposition of child support based on the acknowledgments without an opportunity to litigate paternity. Subsequent amendments to &sect; 46b-172 allowed such putative fathers to challenge paternity within three years of acknowledgement or until October 1, 1982, whichever was later. The State did not seek child support from the putative father until 1989, and asserted that a challenge to paternity was time-barred under &sect; 46b-172(b). The court held that the putative father fell within the class represented in Stone v. Mahar, and ruled that the time limitation in &sect; 46b-172(b) was ineffective to deprive a member of that class an opportunity to litigate paternity.

The memorandum referred to motions passed by the board; it said the Board of Selectmen recommended that a moratorium on single house subdivision and multiple unit housing be enacted by the Town. The court found that while the consideration of ex parte material after the hearing to change the zoning of the property was improper, the mere fact that matters were considered ex parte by a zoning authority did not require automatic reversal. The communication merrily made a recommendation, which was not binding, and it was not a detailed ex parte communications, which thoroughly went into the very merits of the dispute. Further, there was nothing in the record to indicate the commission considered the memorandum in their deliberations or final decision. The court found that the record supported a denial of the zone change on the basis of traffic congestion.</SPAN></P>

Acts 229, which made the awarding of enhanced damages within the discretion of the trier of fact. The court rejected plaintiff's argument that 229 applied retroactively because 229 made not only procedural changes but substantive changes in the law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1988 a motorist sued a lawn company for injuries she allegedly sustained in an accident and claimed multiple damages. Defendant asserted the special defense of contributory negligence. The motorist then filed an amended complaint in 1989 and no objection was registered. In April 1990, defendant filed a motion under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 152 to strike the motorist's claim for multiple damages in her amended complaint, given that the multiple damages statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295, had been found unconstitutional. Citing Conn. Prac. Book &sect; 177, which provided a party that previously filed a responsive pleading 10 days to file a responsive pleading to an amended complaint, but which made the previous pleading operative if no pleading was filed to the amended complaint, the court denied the motion. Because defendant's motion to strike was filed nearly a year after the amended complaint, its previously filed answer was applicable and, thus, its motion needed to be denied. Even though the constitutional defect in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295 was remedied after the instant action was brought, the court refused to change its ruling without an appellate decision on retroactivity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner applied for a subdivision permit from the Wetlands Commission. No activity was planned to take place within the wetlands. Because of soil conditions, curtain drains were constructed on all lots and all four lots were capable of supporting septic systems and on-site private wells. The Wetlands Commission denied the application due to unresolved violations, unclear and contradictory statements in the on-site soils investigation report, and an inadequate soil erosion and sediment control plan. The Planning Commission received a copy of the legal notice of the Wetlands Commission's decision that stated the reasons for the denial. The Planning Commission denied the application on the basis that the Wetlands Commission had denied the wetlands permit and it was unable to monitor the project if approved. The court dismissed the appeals finding that the Wetlands Commission decision had to be sustained because it had substantial evidence properly before it to support at least one of the reasons given for its denial.

The court dismissed the appeal, reasoning that the record did not support the claim that the existing zoning regulations as applied to the parcel that the developer allegedly owned were unconstitutionally confiscatory. The court also held that the developer was not aggrieved because the Commission did not amend the zoning map, because the Commission's decision did not affect a particular piece of land, because the developer's interests were indistinguishable from those of all similarly situated community members, and because merely denying an application did not establish aggrievement. It was further determined that the Commission cited the inconsistency with the comprehensive plan and the potential environmental harm in support of its denial. The court further found that there was no taking because no application to develop any land that the developer allegedly owned in the Borough was filed and that challenging the zoning regulations' constitutionality required a declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In support of their motion to strike plaintiffs' claim for double and treble damages, defendants cited the rule of Bishop v.

Kelly decision and authorized the &quot;trier of fact&quot;, i.e. the jury in a jury trial, to award double or treble damages where appropriate, could not be applied retroactively. The court found that there was a conflict of authority on the issue of whether the amended statute was to be applied retroactively. The court had consistently taken the position that it would not grant motions to strike claims for multiple damages in the absence of an appellate determination of the retroactivity of the new statute. Although the accident occurred before the new legislation, the suit was commenced after its enactment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner filed a four-count complaint against defendants alleging inverse condemnation, malicious erection of a structure, private nuisance, and misrepresentation. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, stating that they were immune from suit. The court dismissed the action, stating that it found that the conclusory allegations contained in count one alleging that the state's construction activities on state land near or adjacent to the property owner's property resulted in a taking of the property did not support a finding of a taking in a constitutional sense. Count one did not allege sufficient facts that would have demonstrated the value of property had been destroyed of its use for proper purpose. Thus, lacking the necessary factual underpinnings for a finding of a taking of land, the claims against the state in count one were barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Further, a review of the language of Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Agents of the Division performed surveillance in a bar and observed the sale of alcohol while nude dancing was being performed. After a hearing, the Division suspended the bar's liquor license for 15 days. The bar owners appealed, contending that the statute under which the suspension was handed out, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 30-6, was unconstitutionally vague; the Division regulation in question established a gender-based classification without justification; the dancers' right to free speech was violated; along with other arguments. The court upheld the penalty, indicating that it probably would have imposed a greater sanction, holding that the regulations were required to ensure proper, safe, and orderly conduct of licensed premises, thus were not impermissibly vague. Despite constitutional freedom of expression implications, dancing actions were not completely shielded from control by the state liquor licensing agency. The equal protection argument failed, as well, because of the obvious difference between men and women. All in each distinct class of sex were treated the same.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the 15-day suspension of the bar owners' liquor license.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the record supported the Commission's conclusions; therefore the decision to approve the subdivision application was not illegal, arbitrary, or an abuse of discretion. The court noted that the property owners did not point to any error in the town engineer's advice, nor did they demonstrate how they were prejudiced by the Commission's use of any information supplied by him. The court found the town engineer was serving under color of a known and valid appointment even though he was not licensed. Therefore, he was a defacto officer. His role was advisory and not binding on the Commission, which had other professional information on which to rely. The court concluded that the property owners had failed to sustain their challenge to the validity of the Commission's decision. The court ruled that that the record demonstrated that the method of calculation used by the Commission was the usual practice. It acted within the scope of its authority in approving the subdivision applications.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the bank failed to carry its burden of proof in with the higher standard of proof in fraud, such that the officer's property was to be release. The court found that (1) where an agent or officer committed or participates in the commission of a tort, whether or not he acted on behalf of his principal or corporation, he was liable to third persons injured thereby; (2) in wanting to vacate a prejudgment remedy, the officer had the burden of demonstrating that there was probable cause to sustain the validity of the claim; and (3)where it was rather vague as to exactly what the officer claimed to have said with respect to a merger, or even how important it was to the bank in inducing it to make the loan, the officer's committing of fraud was not adequately proven.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were involved in a motor vehicle accident which occurred on January 27, 1987.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 14-218, 14-222, 14-240(a) and punitive damages. The court granted defendants' motion to strike the request for double and trebles damages but denied the motion to strike with respect to the request for punitive damages. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295 had been declared unconstitutional, which made the statute unenforceable. The statute was amended on October 1, 1988; however, the amended statute could not be applied retroactively, as it applied only to claims arising on or after its effective date, October 1, 1988. The request for punitive damages was proper because such damages were allowed in tort actions when the evidence showed a reckless indifference to the rights of others or intentional and wanton violation of those rights. Plaintiff asserted punitive damages based upon defendants' conduct, which plaintiff claimed evidenced wanton and reckless indifference to the rights and safety of plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When two agents of the Department entered the cafe to inspect the premises, they saw two nude female dancers.

The court held that the authority given the states by the Twenty-First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to ban alcoholic beverages included the power to ban the sale of liquor on premises where nude dancing occurred. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 30-6 granted to the Department the broad power to make all necessary regulations for insuring proper, safe, and orderly conduct of licensed premises.; and Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 30-6-A24(d) and (e) did not exceed the permissible limits of the Department's rulemaking authority. The prohibited conduct was not expression protected by Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff passenger filed an action against defendants, the owner and operator of the vehicle in which plaintiff was a passenger, in connection with a motor vehicle accident that allegedly occurred on or about September 4, 1988.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On March 22, 1988, the Connecticut Supreme Court declared the former Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295&nbsp;unconstitutional. 1988 Conn. Acts 229 (also Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295) replaced the former multiple damages statute, effective October 1, 1988. Thus, the court noted that the motor vehicle accident occurred after the former version of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295 had been ruled unconstitutional, but before the effective date of 1988 Conn. Acts 229. The passenger's cause of action, and the attendant rights of the parties, arose on September 4, 1988, prior to the effective date of the public act (the new Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-295). The court opined that the changes to &sect; 14-295 affected and involved substantive rights of litigants. Thus, it ruled that 1988 Conn. Acts 229 was not subject to retroactive application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant power company sought review of the decision by respondent, the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC), which concluded that the company required an increase in its electric and gas rates in amounts less than the rate increases sought by the company. The company claimed that the DPUC violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183(g) by rejecting the company's proposed allocation of capacity sales revenues to the shareholders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company also claimed that the DPUC violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183(g)(5), (6) by denying the company's request for an inclusion in its rate base of its electric deferred fuel balance (EDFB). On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal after finding that the company failed to show substantial prejudice under &sect; 4-183(g), failed in its non-utility property claim, and failed to show that the exclusion of EDFB from rate bases had the effect of resulting in rates not in accordance with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 16-19e. The court found that the DPUC was correct in determining that the property, in its entirety, was utility property. Because the DPUC's finding was reasonably supported by the evidence, the court would not disturb the conclusion. Furthermore, the court found that the property was a public utility as a matter of law because the company held itself out to serve the public. Applying case law, the court searched the record for the DPUC's reasons for its decision, which reasons were not sufficiently articulated. In doing so, the court found that there was public utility property because the company set the rate base valuation and the customers paid all operation costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the company's appeal of the DPUC's decision.</SPAN></P>

On two separate occasions he kidnapped his victims and brutally sexually assaulted them. He was later identified by the victims, arrested, and convicted. He was subsequently sentenced. He later brought habeas corpus petitions claiming illegal confinement on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he alleged his counsel did not use in either trial evidence of his mental health, although psychological evaluation performed prior to both trials showed he was suffering from a major depression, anxiety, and a dysthymic disorder, and that he had a schizotypal personality with prominent avoidance traits. After a hearing, the court denied both petitions. The court held that the inmate failed to meet either the performance prong or the prejudice prong regarding his claim. The court ruled that the inmate failed to prove that the failure to present evidence regarding his psychological condition in any way prejudiced his defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants solicited contributions to assist cancer patients, to provide public and professional information, and to support research. Counts V through XVII alleged deceptive practices in solicitations, in the value of the prizes and in the operation of an illegal lottery, in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes &sect; 42-110a et seq. (Connecticut). Defendants argued that CUTPA only applied to commercial activities and speech and that charitable solicitation was not commercial. The court held that CUTPA applied to charitable solicitation organizations. Plaintiffs alleged facts which, if proven, would state causes of action under CUTPA. Defendants also filed motions to strike certain prayers for relief on the grounds that injunctions constituted prior restraint on future solicitation campaigns in violation of the First Amendment. The court held that issues of constitutionality were not appropriate on a motion to strike. Finally, the court held that Count XVIII stated a sufficient cause of action under General Statutes &sect; 45-79 (Connecticut), which required donations to a charitable trust to be used exclusively for a grantor's intentions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motions to strike Counts V through XVIII because there were legally sufficient allegations against each defendant.

Stat. &sect; 53a-179a by way of a motion to dismiss. Defendant had been arrested pursuant to a warrant that charged him with inciting injury to persons or property in violation of &sect; 53a-179a and conspiracy to commit arson in the third degree in violation of &sect; 53a-113.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The affidavit accompanying the warrant contained a verbatim transcript of a telephone conversation between defendant and the accomplice. The accomplice had initiated the call to inquire whether defendant was interested in having him make a pipe bomb or bombs that he proposed to use to damage a certain officer's police car. The officer had been involved in defendant's prior arrest for sexual assault. Two days earlier, during a casual meeting, defendant had stated to the accomplice's brother that he wanted to get back at the officer and wanted to put a bomb in his car. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information. The court denied the motion. Section 53a-179a was neither overbroad nor vague, nor did it, though precise, penalize constitutionally protected conduct. The state could punish advocacy that was directed to inciting or to producing imminent lawless action and that was likely to incite or to produce such action. Persuasion of another by means of overt acts that fell within the penumbra of advocacy and that related to the acquisition of weapons, gunpowder, and the like, had no First Amendment protection.</SPAN></P>

The court granted a motion for preliminary injunction and ordered the agency to refrain from evicting plaintiffs and to continue its rental payments. In articulating its decision on defendant's renewed motion to dismiss, the trial court found that the action was not barred by sovereign immunity and that injunctive relief was appropriate. The court found that Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenant resided in a one-bedroom apartment with her son. Their combined income was less than $ 15,000 per year. The landlord notified all tenants that the apartment complex was being converted to condominiums. The landlord proposed to increase the rent of all one-bedroom units to $ 570 per month. The landlord made roof repairs, waterproofed the basement, made improvements to the heating and air-conditioning system, and installed a new intercom. The tenants complained about the age and condition of the property. The Commission determined the proposed rent increase was harsh and unconscionable and allowed an increase to $ 550 per month. The court affirmed the Commission's decision finding that the Commission's decision was not arbitrary or illegal because it properly considered the statutory factors set forth in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-148c. The court found there was a substantial factual basis to support the Commission's decision.

The court held that the statute did not specifically require an express finding of facts upon which the Commission should base its action.

The court rejected the owners' claims and dismissed the appeal. The court found that Conn. Gen.

There was no predetermination, The owners did not establish nonconforming use status. Approval of the application was not required because the commission had the right to exercise reasonable regulatory power over it.

The defendant reoccupied the apartment in a rooming unit manner without proper approvals. A fire started in the unit and spread throughout the building killing five people. The defendant was charged criminally with violating the state fire code. He moved to dismiss alleging he could not be held criminally liable unless the building had been inspected pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-305 and was further given a period of time to abate the violations pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-306. The court denied the motion to dismiss finding that the investigation and abatement sections of the statutes were not conditions precedent to the penalty sections but were in addition to the penalty sections. The court held that if it was proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant violated the fire safety code, then he was liable to the sanctions set forth in &sect; 29-295 even though the fire marshal may not have inspected the building or ordered an abatement of the violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state commissioner of transportation filed an action against defendant seeking an injunction ordering defendant to remove certain outdoor signs that defendant erected near public highways, or for an order allowing the commissioner to have the signs removed at defendant's expense. Defendant asserted special defenses and a counterclaim based on freedom of speech principals. The case was before the court for its decision on the merits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant operated a signage business. The commissioner filed his action against defendant when, after defendant's applications for placing three signs were denied, defendant went ahead and erected them anyway. He sought fines against defendant as well as an order allowing his department to remove the signs at defendant's expense. Defendant asserted special defenses attacking the constitutionality of the statutes and outdoor advertising regulations upon which the commissioner relied. He also filed a counterclaim. The court visited the site of one contested sign and determined that the sign did not violate the spacing regulations because it was the only sign visible in the area. The other signs violated the law, which served both public safety and aesthetic purposes. It was not unconstitutional to permit offsite commercial billboards while allowing onsite commercial billboards. Onsite billboards were merely part of the commercial premises. Even defendant's sign carrying a political rather than a commercial message could be properly regulated. The regulations that applied were limited, content-neutral, and narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted in part and denied in part the commissioner's request for an injunction. The court ordered the removal of defendant's &quot;off-premises&quot; commercial signs and a noncommercial sign and imposed fines because they had been erected after defendant was denied a permit to erect them. The court denied an injunction with respect to an &quot;on-premises&quot; commercial sign. The court denied defendant's counterclaim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tenants of an apartment building were notified that the building was being converted to condominiums by the end of the month and they were provided with information setting out the purchase price and terms under which they could acquire ownership of a one-bedroom unit.

The Commission first discussed in considerable detail the application of the statutory criteria in &sect; 7-148c to the two-bedroom units for which complaints had been heard. The Commission then discussed the application of the criteria to the one-bedroom units generally and to the individual tenant's complaint and determined that its summation in the two-bedroom cases applied to the one-bedroom cases.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord commenced an eviction action against defendants, the state government, the public works department, and the state product development corporation, seeking possession of two floors of an office building used by the development corporation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord brought an eviction action, claiming that the state development corporation had entered into the lease and that since it was created pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 32-35, and endowed under &sect;&sect; 32-39(4) and 32-39(9) with the power to lease real property, the state had consented to be sued. Further, the landlord argued that the development corporation's possession of the premises after the expiration of the lease constituted a taking of property by eminent domain in violation of the landlord's constitutional rights. Finding no express statute waiving sovereign immunity, the court ruled that the landlord's only remedy was to pursue the action before the claims commissioner. The court also found no express statute permitting the use of summary process against the state. The court further found no constitutional taking of property because there was no indication that the state had intended to permanently deprive the landlord of possession or that the state had effectively destroyed the intended use for private property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff lessor was the successor in interest to a lease executed by its predecessors with the State of Connecticut, Department of Motor Vehicles, for the use of certain premises for a 10-year period. When the lease expired for lapse of time, the lessor served a notice to quit. The instant summary process action was commenced by complaint based upon termination for lapse of time. The State sought to dismiss based on governmental immunity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor stated that the lease had lapsed and admitted in oral argument that it had been receiving use and occupancy payments in the original rental amount each month. Although not alleged in its complaint, the lessor in further claimed that the continued possession of the premises represented an unconstitutional taking, barring the court from granting the State's motion to dismiss on the basis of governmental immunity. The court held that unless a particular statute waived the State's sovereign immunity, the only recourse of the lessor was to file an action with the claims commissioner. The State was immune from suit unless it consented to be sued by appropriate legislation waiving sovereign immunity in certain prescribed cases. Sovereign immunity, in this case, was available as a defense to the State. The court found that the value, or the economic utilization of the premises, had neither been destroyed nor abridged to a substantial degree in the constitutional sense. No taking had occurred. The lessor has been receiving monthly rent payments and never claimed nor established what specific amounts of higher rentals would supposedly be available from a different tenant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor claimed that the State's lease had terminated and that the lessor had secured a lessee willing to pay more rent. The State claimed governmental immunity from the lessor's summary process action. The court found no statute expressly authorizing the use of summary process proceedings against the State, so sovereign immunity was available as a defense. The lessor claimed that its inability to obtain possession of the premises and lease it for a higher rental amount was an unconstitutional taking of property without compensation. However, the lessor continued to receive rent from the State and had not specified the amount of additional rental that it allegedly would receive from a different tenant. There was no taking in the constitutional sense unless the property could not be utilized for any reasonable and proper purpose. The court found that the property's value had not been destroyed nor abridged to a substantial degree in the constitutional sense. It further found no definitive indication that the State had formed a fixed and irreversible intent to continue the utilization of the premises. The lessor had failed to establish an unconstitutional taking of its property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the State's motion to dismiss the lessor's summary process action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was before the Superior Court of Connecticut, Judicial District of Waterbury, to decide plaintiff mobile home owners' action against defendant park owner, seeking an injunction and monetary damages, Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110g(a), (d). They alleged that a rule against the on-site sale of their mobile home violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 21-68a, 21-79. Defendant asserted unconstitutionality of the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mobile home owners filed an action against defendant park owner, asserting that its refusal to permit the on-site sale of their mobile home violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 21-68a, 21-79. They sought an injunction and damages under Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42-110g(a), (d). Defendant alleged that plaintiffs had not complied with a contractual resale standard and that the statutes were unconstitutional. The court rendered judgment for plaintiffs. It construed the statutes as a whole to reconcile their separate parts and held that &sect;&sect; 21-68a, 21-79 were not without adequate standards and were constitutional as written and applied. The court held that defendant's resale standard was not a measuring device to determine safety, but was a flat prohibition against on-site sales of older and usually less-expensive homes. As such, it was a direct contravention of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21-79(b). Plaintiffs, having shown no adequate remedy at law and irreparable injury, were entitled to an injunction against enforcement of the resale standard. The court awarded them compensatory and punitive damages, costs, and attorney's fees under &sect; 42-110g(a), (d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court rendered judgment for plaintiff mobile home owners in an action against defendant park owner to enjoin enforcement of a resale standard that contravened statutes providing for the sale of their mobile home. The statutes were constitutional. Plaintiffs satisfied the prerequisites for injunctive relief. They were also granted compensatory and punitive damages, costs, and attorney's fees for defendant's unfair trade practices.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner sought an order to enjoin the junk yard operator from maintaining a motor vehicle junk yard pursuant to authority granted the Commissioner under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-67v. The Commissioner argued that the operator conducted his junk yard outside the limits of the area approved by the department of motor vehicles and was in violation of several departmental regulations. The operator asserted several special defenses. The court found that the junkyard was being operated in violation of the department regulations, and had created a public nuisance. The court rejected the operator's argument that the regulations were being selectively enforced because the evidence failed to support such charge. The court further held that the fencing regulation was not wrongfully applied to the operator because the operator's junk yard was subject to the zoning permit issued by the city. The court further held that the operator failed to provide beyond a reasonable doubt that the departmental regulations were not vague and perforce unenforceable. The court rejected the operator's laches defense because such defense could not be invoked against a governmental agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment for the Commissioner and authorized him the to enter the junk yard and eliminate the nuisance at the operator's expense.</SPAN></P>

After the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the tortfeasor, the injured person filed a motion to set aside the verdict on the ground that the tortfeasor used his peremptory challenges in violation of the state and federal constitutions by striking from the jury panel every black person who was not excused for cause. The court issued its opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured person was a black female, and the tortfeasor was a white male. The tortfeasor exercised his peremptory challenges to exclude every black person from the jury. The court granted the injured person's motion to set aside the verdict. The court held that the injured person's state constitutional right to a trial by jury was violated because there was a substantial likelihood that the tortfeasor exercised his peremptory challenges solely on the basis of race. The court concluded that the use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors solely on the basis of membership in a cognizable group, within the meaning of the representative cross section rule, violated a party's state constitutional right to trial by jury in both civil and criminal cases. The court found that there was a strong likelihood that the tortfeasor used his peremptory challenges on those excused by him because they were black, rather than because of any specific bias. He failed to sustain his burden of justification, which required him to satisfy the trial court that he exercised the peremptories on grounds that were reasonably relevant to the particular case or its parties or witnesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, state employees appearing individually and as members of a union of management level employees, brought an action for declaratory judgment and an injunction against defendant State, alleging that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-720(g) was unconstitutional, and that &sect; 5-720(b) was unconstitutional to the extent it incorporated &sect; 5-720(g). Section 5-720(g) defined a &quot;managerial employee&quot; by his principal functions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-270(b), managerial employees as defined in &sect; 5-720(g) were not &quot;employees&quot; within the meaning of the Collective Bargaining for State Employees Act (CBSEA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-270 et seq., and thus were denied the rights afforded to &quot;employees&quot; by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-271 under that Act. The court found without merit the State's argument that the state employees had to first exhaust their administrative remedy. The court held that the proper standard for assessing the state employees' equal protection claim was the rational basis test. The classification of managerial employees under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 5-270(g) and the denial to them of collective bargaining rights under CBSEA bore a rational relationship to a legitimate State end and thus survived challenge on equal protection grounds. The statute under attack successfully repelled a vagueness challenge because it distinguished between supervisory and managerial employees with adequate clarity for the laws to be fairly administered. The state employees, having failed to prove denial of any constitutional rights, could not prevail on their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim.</SPAN></P>
