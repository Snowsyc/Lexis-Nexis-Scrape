</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Alaska, Third Judicial Department, Anchorage, that he had waived his constitutional challenges to Alaska Admin. Code tit. 7, &sect; 50.210(c)(5), because his brief, alleging due process and equal protection violations, was inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant argued that Alaska Admin. Code tit. 7, &sect; 50.210(c)(5), which denied foster care licenses to those who had been charged with or convicted of certain crimes, arbitrarily distinguished between applicants who had been charged with crimes but not convicted and those who had not been charged, in violation of Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court first noted that appellant's interest in the license was merely economic, so that it was only entitled to minimal protection. The court then found that the regulation's distinction bore a substantial relationship to the state's compelling interest in protecting foster children, because it provided an efficient means of protecting the children from the risk of being placed with someone who had actually committed a crime but had not been convicted. For the same reasons, the court also found that the regulation did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, holding that appellant's brief was adequate, but that the regulation was constitutional, because it efficiently furthered the state's compelling interest in the welfare of its children by efficiently eliminating foster care applicants who posed a potential risk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee had sanctioned appellant under Alaska Stat. &sect; 08.64.326(a)(8)(A) for violating standards of professional competence. The basis of appellee's decision was that appellant's failure to adequately chart prescriptions for controlled substances amounted to professional incompetence. Appellant contended that Alaska Stat. &sect; 08.64.326(a)(8)(A) was vague as applied to him because there were no specific regulations about record-keeping standards to provide notice of what was required. On appeal, the court held that the statute was not vague as applied to appellant since the term &quot;incompetence or unskillfulness&quot; was not so uncertain as to require further rulemaking. Since testimony was presented which indicated that appellant's record-keeping was inadequate, there was substantial evidence on the record to support appellee's finding that appellant was professionally incompetent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff governor and defendants legislative council and legislators cross appealed Superior Court, First Judicial District, Juneau (Alaska), rulings dismissing defendants' dismissal motion made pursuant to Alaska Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff governor sued defendants, legislative council and legislators, claiming that defendants' override of a bill vetoed by the plaintiff was untimely and did not affect his veto. The trial court agreed, declaring the override vote invalid and the veto effective. Although a substantially identical law passed in the subsequent legislative session, the court found that the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine applied and reversed, holding that, although formally filed in plaintiff governor's name against the defendants, the suit was in substance brought in the name of the state against the legislature. Because Alaska Const. art. III, &sect; 16 expressly forbade such actions, and because the substance of the suit infringed upon the legislature's constitutional domain in precisely the manner that the Constitution's drafters intended to prohibit, the court vacated the plaintiff's summary judgment and directed dismissal of the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment in favor of plaintiff vacated and case remanded for dismissal because the action, although filed by plaintiff governor, was an unconstitutional suit against defendants, legislative council and legislators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which granted him relief from prospective liability for child support of a child of which he acknowledged paternity but later proved he did not father, but it found him liable for child support arrearages from the time of the child's birth through disestablishment of paternity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant acknowledged paternity of a child that he did not father. He did not live with the mother or child, and the mother began to receive public assistance. The Child Support Enforcement Division filed a motion requesting entry of judgment against appellant for child support arrearages. Appellant filed a motion to disestablish paternity, which the court granted prospectively. Appellant claimed that he did not understand that by acknowledging paternity he could be liable for child support and would not have acknowledged it had he known. The court found that he was nevertheless liable for the arrearages. The supreme court reversed the judgment holding that the trial court erred in not holding a hearing on appellant's equitable defense to the entry of the judgment for arrearages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment finding appellant liable for child support arrearages and remanded the case for hearing on appellant's equitable defense to the claimed arrearages because the statute entitled him to a hearing on any defense raised in his response to the Child Support Enforcement Division request for entry of judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee filed a claim for unpaid overtime and liquidated damages against appellant former employer, pursuant to the Alaska Wage and Hour Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.10.110, alleging that her position was improperly classified as exempt from overtime. Appellant counterclaimed, alleging that appellee had breached her fiduciary duty to appellant during her prior tenure as president. The trial court held that appellee's position was not exempt from overtime and that she had not breached her fiduciary duty. The trial court awarded unpaid overtime and an equal amount in liquidated damages. On cross-appeals, appellant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 23.10.110, and appellee challenged the amount of the award. The court affirmed judgment for appellee, but reversed the damages award. The court held that the mandatory award of liquidated damages under &sect; 23.10.110 did not violate substantive due process, procedural due process, or equal protection. The court vacated the damages award and remanded for the trial court to re-calculate appellee's overtime compensation rate and to determine the applicability of Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.30.070(b), limiting the award of prejudgment interest.</SPAN></P>

A decision dismissing appellant's suit under Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 51-60, and awarding attorney's fees to appellee was reversed and remanded. Federal law applied in deciding questions as to the tolling of the limitation provision. Appellant, by exercising reasonable diligence, could not have discovered essential information bearing on her claim until the adjuster's letter arrived. Appellant's workers' compensation injury report gave notice of her injury and claims. The suspension approach and the reasonable time approach gave appellant the entire three-year limitations period in which to file her complaint for her traditional maritime remedies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant admitted he was the father of a child, and the trial court accordingly entered a paternity judgment against him. Six years later, genetic testing excluded appellant as the father. Seeking relief under Alaska R. Civ. P. 60(b)(5), appellant filed a motion to vacate the judgment of paternity, arguing that the judgment should no longer have prospective application. The trial court vacated the paternity judgment, but refused to extinguish accrued child support arrearages. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that appellant was not entitled to retroactive relief under Rule 60(b)(5). The court concluded that Rule 60(b)(5) differentiated between prospective assessment for child support payment in the future and prospective collection of arrearages that resulted from a failure to pay past-due support. The court noted that an alternative distinction would give child support obligors incentive not to pay child support and not to resolve paternity disputes promptly. The court further concluded that the state would not be unjustly enriched by collecting arrearages which had accrued before appellant's paternity was disestablished.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, which held Alaska's 1996 campaign finance reform statute, Senate Bill 191, to be unconstitutional after finding it to have violated rights of free speech and association by restricting campaign contributions and expenditures for state and local elections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alaska legislature reformed Alaska's campaign financing statutes in 1996 by enacting Senate Bill 191 (Act). Appellee, the Alaska Civil Liberties Union, sued the state, seeking a judgment that would declare that parts of the Act violated rights of free speech and association by restricting campaign contributions and expenditures for state and local elections. The court below accepted appellee's arguments and held the Act unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that appellant had a legitimate interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption in state election campaigns. The court also found that most of the challenged provisions were narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. The judgment of the lower court was reversed as to several of the Act's provisions, including the ban on independent expenditures by non-group entities; the ban on contributions by corporations; the limits on individual contributions; and the restriction on contributions by nonresidents. However, the judgment of the lower court was affirmed to the extent that it related to the invalidity of the Act's pre-election year and legislative session contribution bans.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment finding the state's finance reform statute unconstitutional was reversed as to a majority of the statute's provisions because appellant was found to have had a legitimate interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption in state elections. The lower court's judgment was affirmed as it related to the invalidity of pre-election year and legislative session contribution bans.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Kenai, which modified a child custody order after a show cause hearing. Appellant alleged that the modification violated his right to due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father and appellee mother were divorced and the trial court granted joint legal custody but gave primary physical custody to appellee. The parties thereafter agreed to transfer the children's primary physical custody to appellant. The trial court approved the change. Thereafter, appellee moved to enforce the visitation order, claiming that appellant failed to make the children available for visitation. The trial court issued a show cause order and scheduled a contempt hearing, at which it awarded sole legal and primary physical custody to appellee. Appellant sought review. The court vacated the custody modification order and remanded, finding that appellant's due process rights were violated because neither party had been put on notice that a change in custody was at issue at the show cause hearing. The court found that the Alaska Constitution required that parties in a custody proceeding receive adequate notice and a hearing that granted them the opportunity to present the quantum of evidence needed to make an informed and principled determination. The court also found that the trial court failed to consider the statutory factors for modification of custody.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The modification of custody order was vacated and the matter remanded, on the grounds that appellant's rights of due process were violated by the lack of notice that his custody rights were at issue at the show cause hearing that preceded entry of the modification order. The trial court did not address the statutory factors that were potentially relevant to the children's best interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant held mining claims located on lands held by a public trust but was unable to mine its claims due to a preliminary injunction entered in litigation over appellee State's handling of trust lands. Appellant sought judicial review after the lower court dismissed its suit for economic losses and argued that the State unconstitutionally took its rights to mine the land, depriving it of private property without just compensation. The court disagreed and held that the takings doctrine was not implicated because the State did not deprive appellant of any property right. The court reasoned that appellant had no right to mine the land because its rights were prospective and contingent on the existing claims of the public trust. The court also held there was no per se taking because there was no physical invasion of appellant's property nor was there any denial of all economically feasible use of the property since the injunction only delayed appellant's ability to obtain permission to mine the property. In addition, the court found there was no contract between appellant and the State and therefore no breach of contract. The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was absent from the state for more than 180 days in one year to care for his infirm mother. Holding that Alaska Admin. Code tit. 15, &sect; 23.163(c) (1997) was not arbitrary or capricious, and that its application to appellant was not unconstitutional, the court affirmed the judgment. Reviewing the agency's determination independently, the court held that &sect; 23.163 did not circumvent the intent of Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.23.015(a). The court noted that the regulation was authorized by &sect; 43.23.015(a), and was consistent with the purpose of Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.23.095(8), which was to limit payment of dividends to permanent residents, and to ease the administrative burden of attempting to determine what treatment level was sufficient to merit eligibility for a permanent fund dividend (PFD). The court held that &sect; 23.163(c) as applied to appellant did not violate procedural due process. Noting the absence of a fact dispute, the court held that appellant was not entitled to an agency hearing. The court also held that &sect; 43.23.095(8) and &sect; 23.163(c) did not violate appellant's rights to substantive due process, equal protection of the laws, or his right to travel.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the regulation was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee was injured on the job and sought workers' compensation benefits from appellee employer. She had been a full-time employee, but became a part-time employee working double shifts shortly before her accident because her former employer declared bankruptcy and terminated her. After her accident, she double-shifted only occasionally. The workers' compensation board deviated from Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.220 because it believed it would be unfair to appellee to classify appellant as full-time. The superior court affirmed the board's decision, but the court reversed the superior court and the board. The board was correct to apply the version of &sect; 23.30.220(a) in effect at the time of appellant's injury. The board erred, however, when it refused to consider appellant's double-shifting to determine her earning potential. Thus, the board lacked substantial evidence for its decision to deviate from the formula contained in &sect; 23.30.220. The court remanded so that the board could award appellant compensation calculated by the statutory formula, attorney fees, and costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the superior court's judgment because appellee did not meet its burden of showing that the statutory formula for determining appellant's temporary total disability benefits inadequately predicted appellant's probable wages had she not been hurt on the job, and the court remanded with instructions for the board to award appellant compensation under the statutory formula and to award her attorney fees and costs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, the court first affirmed the termination of appellant mother's parental rights pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.10.010(a)(2)(A). The court found that the trial court's ruling that appellant mother was unwilling to care for her child was not clearly erroneous. The court noted that appellant mother's mental illness, and her refusal to obtain treatment for it, was the principal evidence to support this finding, on the rationale that a parent objectively willing to provide care would have been willing to address the condition which precluded the provision of care. The court next affirmed the termination of appellant father's parental rights. The court found evidence of appellant father's unwillingness, including absenteeism, emotional neglect, and a refusal to accept physical custody of his child after a foster placement, so that the trial court's finding was not clearly erroneous. The court also held that appellant father's &quot;willingness by declaration only&quot; to be inadequate in light of his deeds. The court held that the trial court did not err in declining to hear new evidence on a prior remand, and held that &sect; 47.10.010(a)(2)(A) was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A ballot initiative was certified that would, if passed, criminalize both the use of snares to trap wolves and the possession, sale, or purchase of wolf pelts known to have been taken by snare. Appellees, concerned citizens and community organizations, filed suit in the trial court and sought to remove the initiative prohibiting use of snares to trap wolves from the general election ballot contending that it was not constitutional. The trial court granted the appellees' motion for summary judgment and enjoinment of the ballot measure and decertified the wolf snare ballot initiative. The state filed an appeal which was expedited. The court, applying a de novo standard of review, examined the constitutionality of using the ballot initiative process to prohibit wolf snare traps. The court reversed the trial court's order of summary judgment against the state and its injunction, and placed the initiative back on the general election ballot because the prohibition of wolf snare traps was an appropriate subject for a ballot initiative given the Alaska Constitution's mandate for the state to manage its natural resources.</SPAN></P>

Prof. Conduct 1.8e.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney represented client in a wrongful death action. In connection with this litigation, appellant advanced his client money for living expenses. When the action settled, appellant requested reimbursement of the loans from the settlement fund. The lower court denied the request, holding that Alaska R. Prof. Conduct 1.8e prohibited counsel from financially assisting a client except for advancement of court fees and litigation expenses. Appellant challenged this ruling, contending that Alaska R. Prof. Conduct 1.8e permitted loans for living expenses, or that it unconstitutionally impeded court access and should be changed, that Alaska R. Civ. P. 90.2 required clarification, and that he deserved attorney's fees. The court affirmed the lower court's order, concluding that the rule prohibited counsel's loan to his client and that it did not impede court access because it allowed assistance with court costs and litigation expenses. Appeal was an improper procedure for changing the rule. Appellant waived his challenge to Alaska R. Civ. P. 90.2 by inadequate briefing. Appellant was not a prevailing party entitled to attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's denial of appellant attorney's request because a rule of professional conduct prohibited counsel from loaning his client money for living expenses and this rule did not unconstitutionally infringe upon court access. Moreover, appellant waived his challenge to settlement procedures by failing to brief the issue, and appellant was not entitled to attorney's fees because he was not a prevailing party.</SPAN></P>

Appellants had hoped to show that harvesting could help stanch a beetle epidemic that was decimating forests. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees. The court held that there was no legally enforceable contract because when appellee state promised to entertain applications, it promised at most to negotiate. Appellee state never objectively manifested an intent to be bound. Moreover, appellee officials' various comments and silences could not, as a matter of law, have manifested unequivocal acceptance. Because there was no promise to sell, and appellee state negotiated in good faith, the court held that the rule of promissory estoppel did not apply. Appellants' quantum meruit claim was rejected because appellants' offered to help prepare a site-specific forest land-use plan, and never said, until submitting an invoice, that payment was expected. The court found that appellants volunteered to do the work in order to gain a business advantage.</SPAN></P>

The superior court applied Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.55.548(b) to subtract appellant's medical expenses paid by his insurer from the jury's medical expenses award.

Appellant contended that &sect; 09.55.548(b) violated his substantive due process and equal protection rights. Appellant also argued that he should have been awarded enhanced attorney fees. The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court and held that &sect; 09.55.548(b) did not violate appellant's substantive due process rights or his equal protection rights because the statute was reasonably related to the stated purpose of reducing the cost of medical malpractice insurance.

The court reversed and remanded and held that the statute clearly articulated a legitimate public policy for targeting the driver's licenses of delinquent obligors because appellant needed to collect child support from all obligors. The sanction of losing a license was rational, and as soon as appellee began to comply with a payment agreement, then appellant was to release his license. Appellee was not denied due process or equal protection of the laws because appellant could not have required payments beyond his best efforts.

At the hearing, members of his jury testified that they had discussed matters not presented at trial, including the fact that petitioner might have been drinking the night of the alleged rape. The superior court granted petitioner a new trial, but the court of appeals reversed. It ruled that Alaska R.

The court reversed the court of appeals and concluded that pre-existing juror knowledge about the facts of petitioner's alleged crime did constitute extraneous prejudicial information within the meaning of Rule 606(b).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxing authority sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Kenai, which reversed the district court's entry of summary judgment, holding respondent tax obligor liable for taxes accrued on a ship after he sold it, and holding that the due process and commerce clauses required reduction of the tax to reflect the vessel's post-assessment sale and its departure from borough waters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner taxing authority sought to collect a full year's tax, which respondent tax obligor refused to pay, on his locally-harbored ship, which he owned on the first day of the tax year, the assessment date, but sold a few months later. The superior court, relying on U.S. Const. amend. XIV, cl. 1 and art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, ordered apportionment of the tax to reflect the portion of the year during which respondent owned the ship. The court held that personal property tax did not &quot;accrue&quot; day by day. The system of property taxation determined the principal attributes of tax status, value, situs, and ownership, as of January 1 each year; once tax status was determined, the property tax itself became fixed each year as of that date. The tax &quot;accrued&quot; in full each year on January 1. Apportionment of respondent's tax for the ship was not necessary to avoid an unconstitutional taking of his property or to prevent the possibility of multiple taxation because post-assessment changes were taken into account the next tax year, and the retrospective property tax approach was applied uniformly throughout the state and nationwide.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the district court to reenter judgment for petitioner taxing authority and holding respondent tax obligor liable for a full year's taxes on a ship after he had sold it. The court held that the ship's tax status became fixed for the full tax year on the assessment date. Apportionment of respondent's tax was not necessary to avoid an unconstitutional taking or to prevent multiple taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After two years of marriage, appellant father separated from his wife. His wife moved in with another man and more than a year later gave birth to a child. Because appellant was still married to his wife, appellant's name appeared on the child's birth certificate. Appellee, the Department of Revenue, Child Support Enforcement Division, issued an order that appellant was to pay support for the child and six years later upon review of the order, appellee modified its order and again ordered appellant to pay support for the child. Upon hearing, appellee affirmed its support determination and held that it had no jurisdiction to disestablish paternity and that support was required unless a court disestablished appellant as the child's father. That decision was affirmed by the lower court and the court affirmed. The court held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.27.166 did not change the legal consequences of actions taken by appellant before it was passed because he was not in the class of fathers who could have taken advantage of the new authority authorized by it. Further, the court held that appellee lacked statutory authority to disestablish paternity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged denial of his motion to dismiss paternity action brought by appellees, child support division and minor child, by the Superior Court, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks (Alaska), after the trial court stayed a standing order for blood tests under Alaska R. Civ. P. 35 and Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.20.050(e). Appellant argued that the standing order was unconstitutional and that the action was time barred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When her minor child began questioning about his father, mother of appellee, minor child, requested help from appellee, child support division, which instituted a paternity action against appellant father. Appellant requested a stay of the standing order for blood tests under Alaska R. Civ. P. 35 and Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.20.050(e), which was granted until the trial court denied his motion to dismiss. Appellant challenged. The court held that because appellee, minor child, was under the age of majority when the cause of action arose, the statute of limitations was tolled during his minority even though appellant, child support division, could have brought the action on his behalf. Appellant's due process rights were not violated by the standing order, because mother's affidavit alleging paternity was a showing of reasonable cause to order blood testing. The trial court did not err in its calculation of the probability of paternity based on the scientific evidence presented. Therefore, because appellant had not met his burden to rebut the presumption of paternity under &sect; 25.20.050(d) with clear and convincing evidence, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff brought suit against defendant city for damages, and, after a remand for a determination of whether the officer's conduct violated plaintiff's rights under U.S. Const. XIV, the trial court granted summary judgment on defendant's motion, finding that defendant was be held liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for failing to train its police officers in pursuit driving. Defendant cross-appealed that the trial court erred by using improper standards to judge liability. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that &sect; 1983 was inapplicable to plaintiff's complaint. The court held that absent a constitutional violation by the police officer of plaintiff's substantive due process rights, defendant was not liable under &sect; 1983. Even though the police officer's conduct was negligent, the record did not permit a conclusion that it shocked the conscience. Because the officer's conduct did not shock the conscience, plaintiff did not suffer a Fourteenth Amendment violation. The court held it unnecessary to rule on the cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated and reversed the superior court's orders striking the hiring hall provision and modifying the fringe benefit provision and affirmed its ruling upholding the rest of the agreement.

The trial court reversed appellant's decision.

The court remanded for a redetermination of whether appellee's income was operational or investment income. The court found that appellee's out-of-state investment income could be apportioned for state taxation only if either the investment itself constituted part of appellee's unitary business, where unitariness was indicated by functional integration, centralization of management, and economies of scale, or the investment was short term and the income was used to fund the unitary business, such that the investment was analogous to a bank account for the unitary business.</SPAN></P>

State courts had jurisdiction to decide cases involving the discharge of members of the National Guard who were state employees, and federal law did not pre-empt the state courts' rights. The court agreed that appellee was a state employee, but because no statute or regulation had been adopted that applied the Alaska Personnel Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 39.25.010 et seq., to the termination of a National guardsman, that statute did not apply. The court stated that appellee did have a property interest in full severance pay and a liberty interest in his reputation and was entitled to a full adversarial hearing before being terminated. Appellee's discharge from the Alaska National Guard noted that he was discharged for misconduct, and this sufficiently stigmatized him so that constitutional due process protection was triggered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought judicial review of an administrative decision that denied his request to reduce the period for which his driver's license had been revoked. Defendant was arrested for a third time in 10 years for driving while intoxicated (DWI), and his license was revoked for three years, pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030(o)(4)(A). On appeal, the court affirmed, and held that defendant was not entitled to a reduction in the revocation period. The court found that defendant's two prior convictions were final as the result of defendant's failure to timely appeal. Also, even though one of the prior convictions was vacated on procedural grounds after the date of the instant offense, defendant immediately pleaded no contest to the same charge. The change in the conviction date did not change the fact that two convictions for DWI had been entered against defendant prior to his most recent arrest. Moreover, enforcement of the original revocation period posed no threat of actual injustice as there was no question that defendant was guilty of the prior charges. Finally, the three-year revocation accurately reflected defendant's potential danger as a driver to the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant purchased drugs from an undercover officer. When defendant requested to make a phone call, the officer said he could do so at the jail. Defendant then provided his home address. The officer obtained a search warrant for the residence by telling the magistrate that defendant told her the location and that she confirmed the address from his driver's license, which actually had a different address. The officer later testified she meant to identify the vehicle license as the confirmation source. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress and defendant was convicted. The court held that the &quot;independent source&quot; exception did not apply because the officer did not actually use the available independent source in applying for the warrant. The court adopted the &quot;inevitable discovery&quot; exception, and remanded the case for consideration of that exception. If the state could show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the illegally obtained evidence would have been discovered through predictable investigative processes, such evidence need not be suppressed as long as the police did not knowingly or intentionally violate defendant's rights in obtaining that evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the appellate court, which affirmed the trial court's decision that the evidence was admissible under the independent source exception to the exclusionary rule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital association, a nonprofit corporation, enacted a policy whereby it prevented elective abortions from being performed at its hospital. The coalition challenged the policy. On appeal of the lower court's granting of a permanent injunction preventing enforcement of the policy, the court ruled that the hospital was &quot;quasi-public&quot; because it received funds from the state and participated in its certificate of need program. Therefore, the court ruled that under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 22, the hospital, as a state actor, could not interfere with a woman's right to an elective abortion in the absence of a compelling state interest that was narrowly tailored. The court found that the association had not met such a test since it advanced no medical, safety, or other public welfare interest for its policy. The court also ruled that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in awarding the coalition $ 110,000 in attorney fees because it found that the association was not a public interest litigant. The court also held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 18.16.010(b), which allowed hospitals to refuse abortions, was unconstitutional to the extent that it applied to quasi-public institutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Eleven million gallons of petroleum were discharged onto a reef after the captain ran his ship aground. The jury found that the captain had negligently discharged oil onto the land, and he was convicted under Alaska Stat. &sect; 46.03.740 of a class B misdemeanor. The trial court ruled that the conviction could be predicated upon a finding of ordinary negligence. On appeal of the court of appeals reversal of that decision, the court ruled that the conviction was proper. The court found the captain was not denied due process under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 7 because reasonable deterrence was the basic principle of the due process balance between individual and societal interests and society could reasonably expect the captain to conform his or her conduct to the law. The court held that the negligence standard was constitutionally permissible because it approximated what the due process guarantee aimed at: an assurance that criminal penalties would be imposed only when the conduct at issue was something society could reasonably expect to deter. The court also disagreed with the captain's contention that &sect; 46.03.740 itself incorporated a criminal negligence mens rea standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate did not dispute that he was ineligible for a PFD under the terms of Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.23.005(d), but he challenged the statute as unconstitutional. The inmate's argument that &sect; 43.23.005(d) was an ex post facto law had already been rejected by the Alaska Supreme Court in a previous action to which the inmate was a party, and because the Alaska Supreme Court had held that denial of a PFD under &sect; 43.23.005(d) was not a criminal punishment for purposes of the ex post facto clause, the inmate's argument that he was being subjected to increased punishment and, thus, double jeopardy was invalid. The inmate's claim that he was entitled to compensation for a taking of his interest in the wealth produced by state land was unavailing because at most, the inmate was entitled to procedural due process in the denial of his PFD and he could not contend that he had been denied such due process. The court also held that the superior court properly held that the inmate was not subject to fee awards because he had an economic interest in the form of dividend payments that he stood to collect if his action succeeded and, thus, he did not quality as a public interest litigant.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the members had a vested interest in the surpluses generated by their plans and that using the new actuarial tables for calculating benefits violated their constitutional rights. The court reasoned that the members were entitled to have the level of rights and benefits preserved in substance without any modification downwards.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen filed an action against the governor alleging that the governor was in concert with others to engage in a smear campaign against him. The citizen alleged that the campaign improperly used the criminal justice system records, and that the campaign was conducted in retaliation for the citizen's protected political activity seeking the removal of the governor. The superior court ruled that the governor was protected by the doctrine of public executive immunity. The citizen claimed that people had a constitutional right to be free from acts of retaliation by officials made in response to speech or other activities protected by the U.S. Const. amend. I. The court stated that making public officials civilly liable for retaliatory speech would, in essence, convert the U.S. Const. amend. I model of an interchange into a one-way street. This would be fundamentally inconsistent with the values protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. Therefore, the citizen did not have a valid claim of retaliation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A road that became public was illegally built on the landowner's allotment that was protected by 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 410. More than two decades later, the land on which the road was located was formally taken in condemnation proceedings and a money judgment in the landowner's favor was entered. Prior to his termination as counsel to the landowner in the condemnation action, the attorney filed an attorney's lien seeking security for payment of his fees from litigation proceeds. The municipality, fearing it would be unable to pay the condemnation award, filed an interpleader in the superior court. Subsequently, the superior court dismissed the action, reasoning that it was divested of subject matter jurisdiction by the application of 25 U.S.C.S.&sect; 410. In reversing and remanding, the court found that Alaska Bar R. 40(t) required the superior court to confirm an award and reduce it to judgment upon the application of a party unless either party timely sought to vacate, correct or modify it.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State prison officials promulgated a policy preventing inmates in state correctional facilities from possessing computer printers in their cells. The inmate filed a civil rights action against prison officials seeking damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. The superior court granted summary judgment to the prison officials.

However, the court reversed the superior court's judgment regarding the inmate's claims for declaratory and injunctive relief based upon denial of access to the courts. The court ruled that a genuine fact issue existed regarding the constitutionality of the policy because the record showed that the policy was specifically intended to interfere with inmates' access to the courts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant intervenors sought review of a judgment from the Fairbanks Superior Court (Alaska), which refused to award the intervenors attorney's fees pursuant to Alaska R. Civ. P. 82 after the intervenors successfully challenged the approval of appellee State's settlement proposal. The trial court held that the intervenors were not prevailing parties because the settlement would have been disapproved without intervention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the State removed lands from a public trust, plaintiffs filed an action, alleging a breached of duty. After the State was ordered to reconstitute the trust, plaintiffs enjoined the State from transferring trust lands and filed a notice of lis pendens. When the State proposed a settlement, plaintiffs moved to modify the injunction and to release the lis pendens. Thereafter, the intervenors moved to intervene, opposing the settlement and plaintiffs' motion. After plaintiffs' motion was denied and the settlement was disapproved, the intervenors sought attorney's fees under rule 82. In denying attorney's fees, the trial court held that the intervenors were not prevailing parties because the settlement would have been disapproved without intervention. Upon review, the court held that even though the trial court had not adopted all of the intervenors' arguments or vindicated all their claims, it had refused to approve the settlement. As such, the court held that the intervenors were prevailing parties because they had been successful on the action's &quot;main issue&quot; and because prevailing party status did not depend on whether an argument directly caused a favorable decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged a decision of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which affirmed the board's denial of the employee's claim for workers' compensation benefits for physical and mental injuries she allegedly sustained as a result of her employment with the State Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED), a division of appellee State of Alaska, Department of Revenue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, who suffered from work-related stress, worked for CSED for more than 10 years. She retired under the state's Retirement Incentive Program and then filed a report of occupational injury or illness with the board, claiming that numerous stress-related physical and mental injuries arose from her employment. The board denied the employee's claims, and the superior court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that: (1) the employee's claims were not time-barred under Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.100, because CSED had notice of the employee's illness and was not prejudiced by her failure to give timely notice; (2) the board did not err in denying the employee's mental injury claim, because substantial evidence supported the board's finding that the employee did not face extraordinary or unusual stress; and (3) the board erred in denying the employee's physical injury claim, because the employee made out a prima facie case of aggravation or acceleration of a pre-existing disease or condition sufficient to raise the statutory presumption of compensability, and the state did not offer substantial evidence rebutting that presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's decision that the employee's claims were not time-barred.

The court reversed the superior court's decision affirming the denial of the employee's physical injury claim and remanded, with instructions to remand to the board to determine the benefits due the employee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A law designating nonsubsistence hunting and fishing areas was challenged and found to be unconstitutional. Thus, the Boards of Fisheries and Game were required to adopt emergency subsistence regulations for those areas. Authority to adopt the necessary regulations was delegated to the Commissioner, who issued notice to adopt the emergency regulations as permanent regulations. After appellant commenced this action challenging the validity of the regulations, the court held that the creation of nonsubsistence areas pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.258(c) did not violate the constitution. The subsistence hunting and fishing regulations adopted by the Commissioner were then repealed, which rendered appellant's action moot. The court found that the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine should not be applied because the factual and legal issues were inextricably dependent upon the particular factual and procedural circumstances that existed at the time of the adoption of the subsistence regulations and therefore were not capable of repetition. The court also found that the Commissioner's actions did not come within the Open Meetings Act, Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 44.62.310 - .312.</SPAN></P>

The settlement agreement provided for creation of a trust authority, establishment of institutional mechanisms to protect the trust, management of trust land, budgeting advantages for the mental health program, and improvements in mental health programs. On appeal, the court concluded that the superior court did not err in determining that the agreement had many benefits for the subject class over the likely result of continued litigation, and that it represented a fair, adequate, and reasonable settlement of the litigation.

Defendant approached several jurors and attempted to inform them about jury nullification, whereby the juror's would ignore the judge's instructions and make an independent determination as to the validity of the law they were to apply. Defendant claimed that the jury tampering statute was void for vagueness and unconstitutionally overbroad and that he could not commit a criminal trespass on a public building during a time when the building was open to the public. The court rejected his contentions and affirmed his conviction. The court held that defendant's free speech rights could be curtailed to insure a fair trial, and that the jury tampering statute did not reach constitutionally protected speech. The court examined the statute's chilling effect, whether it gave adequate notice, and whether the language encouraged arbitrary enforcement in determining that it was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

Respondent employee cross appealed from the trial court's entry of summary judgment as to her allegations of slander, violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and the award of fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the employer terminated the employee without providing a hearing, the employee appealed to an administrative board that affirmed the termination after a hearing.

The employer appealed, although the trial court's ruling was not an appealable final judgment. The court treated the appeal as a petition for review, which was granted because it presented an important constitutional question. The court ruled that the post-hearing supplementation of the record with witness affidavits provided sufficient due process for a curative post-termination hearing because the employee was terminated solely for failure to maintain a required job clearance. The summary judgment in favor of the employer was affirmed as to the employee's claims of slander and violation of her federal civil rights.

The court affirmed the summary judgment for the employer on the claims of slander and civil rights violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant seller challenged an order of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which was entered in appellee State's action that charged the seller with making telephone sales without registering as a telephonic seller under &sect; 45.63.010 of the Telephonic Solicitation Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 45.63.010. The order forbade the seller from initiating calls to Alaska customers under Alaska Stat. &sect; 45.63.080(14).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The seller made numerous sales by calling customers on the telephone. Thereafter, the State charged that the seller had made such sales without registering as a telephonic seller under Alaska Stat. &sect; 45.63.010. The parties stipulated to a permanent injunction that precluded the seller from making telephone sales without first registering in accordance with the Act. The injunction also required the trial court's permission for the seller to operate through the &quot;mail order sales&quot; exemption in Alaska Stat. &sect; 45.63.080(14). The trial court denied the seller's motion for permission to operate through &sect; 45.63.080(14), and limited it to receiving calls from customers responding to the seller's catalog. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order and held that the exemption did not encompass sales that were initiated by a telephone call from a seller following the delivery of a mail order catalog to consumers. The court held that this interpretation comported with the Act's purpose, which was to prevent the unregistered telephone marketers from making unsolicited sales calls. The court concluded that the interpretation was consistent with the legislative history of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court, which forbade the seller from initiating calls to Alaska customers under the catalog exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Appeals of the State of Alaska, which affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and refusing to submit to a breath test under Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.032(f).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After his arrest for DWI, defendant requested a blood test of his alcohol level; the police officer refused. After several unsuccessful attempts to obtain a breath sample, the officer charged defendant with refusal to submit to a breath test, although he offered to keep trying and again requested a blood test. The intermediate appellate court affirmed his DWI conviction. Defendant claimed that the state violated his statutory and constitutional right to an independent chemical test and that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the defense of subsequent consent. The court reversed his conviction. The court held that the Due Process Clause, Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 7, entitled a DWI arrestee to an independent chemical test even if he refused to take the statutorily prescribed breath test as long as such a test was not impracticable. The remedy for the state's violation of defendant's due process right was a presumption on remand that an independent blood test would have been favorable to defendant. Some evidence supported defendant's request for an instruction on subsequent consent to a breath test to cure a prior refusal; the instruction should have been given.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the state should have provided defendant with the opportunity to obtain an independent test of his blood alcohol content. The court found that the trial court should have instructed the jury on the defense of subsequent consent. The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the taxpayers argued that in creating the new service area, the municipality violated its own charter and ordinances as well as the equal protection guarantees in the state and federal constitutions. The court affirmed the superior court's decision in favor of the municipality. In doing so, the court concluded from the legislative history of the Home Rule Charter for the Municipality of Anchorage (Charter) that the Charter Commission did not limit the term &quot;area affected&quot; to only the geographic area into which services would be extended, and thus, the Anchorage Assembly had the power to determine that all persons living in the Anchorage Police Service Area (APSA) and the Hillside were within the area affected by AO &sect; 96-30(S), even though that determination would mean that residents of the Hillside would not be permitted to approve the new APSA by a separate vote. Because the APSA was within the area affected, the assembly correctly permitted APSA residents to vote. Thus, every voter within the area affected by AO &sect; 96-30(S) was given an equally powerful vote, and no person's right to equal protection was violated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A couple engaged to be married brought suit against their employer for unlawful discrimination. The district court granted the employer's motion for summary judgment on all claims, except that of marital status discrimination in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 18.80.220, and certified questions concerning the scope of the statute's coverage pursuant to Alaska R. App. P. 407(a). The court held that &sect; 18.80.220(a)(1) was limited to preventing employers from discriminating against an employee based on the status of being married, and did not prohibit an employer from discriminating against an employee based on the identity of his or her spouse or future spouse. The court found that the legislature intended that the term &quot;marital status&quot; be interpreted in accordance with its plain meaning and rejected the couple's interpretation that the term embraced the identity of a spouse or intended spouse. The legislature was presumed to act with other statutes in mind and the absence of a legislative definition or provision for the impact of a more expansive definition on anti-nepotism laws indicated that the plain meaning was intended.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group challenged the lieutenant governor's certification of the proponent's initiative application for inclusion on the general election ballot claiming that the proposed bill was not a proper subject of an initiative because it would cause state property, being its salmon resources, to be appropriated in violation of anti-appropriation provisions in Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.45.010. When the superior court granted summary judgment to the proponent and the lieutenant governor, the group appealed. The court reversed. It ruled that the proposed initiative made an appropriation of state property in violation of Alaska Const. art. XI, &sect; 7, because even though the state did not &quot;own&quot; the salmon in the same fashion that it owned state land, salmon was a state asset to be managed by the state as a public trust. It also held that proscriptions against the making of appropriations by initiative in Alaska Const. art. XI, &sect; 7, and Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.45.010 were violated by the proposed measure because it appealed to self-interest and impinged on the legislature's power to allocate resources among competing users.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DNR claimed back royalties plus interest due on three non-competitive coal leases held by the coal mine. Before the initial royalty term on any of the leases had expired, the DNR promulgated regulations setting a standard royalty rate in Alaska Admin. Code tit. 11, &sect; 85.220 (1996). The coal mine was granted some measure of relief but was ultimately required to pay all back royalties. The superior court affirmed the DNR's decision and upon the coal mine's appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the DNR's regulations were valid because there had been a valid implied delegation of rule-making authority to the DNR to adjust royalty rates for coal leases. Further, there were sufficient standards and procedures to ensure the valid exercise of the DNR's authority and the regulations were consistent with Alaskan law. The DNR's interpretation of the regulations was reasonable. The coal mine did not have a contractual right to have the adjusted royalty rates on its leases established by negotiation, and the DNR was not equitably estopped from collecting the back royalties. Finally, the court declined to review the DNR's decision not to forgive royalties owed by the coal mine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed to the court after the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, affirmed an administrative determination of the Department of Public Safety to revoke the driver's license of defendant after he was arrested for driving while intoxicated. The scope of the administrative hearing was limited by Alaska Statute &sect; 28.15.166(g), and an issue was the constitutionality of that limitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When police found defendant, he was tied to a post as part of a citizen's arrest. He had walked into a lot and bickered with a woman. According to witnesses including that woman, he had previously been following her with a car and drove into the lot and left and came back on foot. At the revocation proceeding, defendant claimed that he had not been driving; thus, he denied an essential element of the offense of driving while intoxicated. Alaska Statute &sect; 28.15.166(g) said that the revocation hearing was limited to determining whether or not the police had a reasonable basis to believe that defendant had been operating while intoxicated a motor vehicle, commercial motor vehicle, or aircraft. The court ruled that as applied &sect; 28.15.166(g) was unconstitutional. That was because the statute foreclosed any opportunity to show that the police were mistaken about defendant driving while intoxicated even though they had a reasonable ground or grounds to believe that he had been driving while intoxicated. At the revocation hearing, defendant had to be granted the opportunity to contest fully issues of central importance to the revocation decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the superior court's decision, and the court remanded the case to the superior court with an instruction to remand it to the Department for a new hearing to include an inquiry about whether or not defendant was driving at the time of the alleged offense.</SPAN></P>

Because due process required only that a party have an adequate opportunity to represent his interests, the mandatory arbitration provisions were not proven not to offend that right. The attorney had the burden of demonstrating the unconstitutionality of the challenged provision and he failed to establish that the bar rules requiring arbitration so violated his due process rights as to overcome the beneficial effect it had on the legal system by providing clients with a recourse against unfair legal fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged the decision of the Fairbanks Superior Court, Fourth Judicial District (Alaska), which removed her children from her custody. The mother contended that the superior court made inadequate findings under Alaska CINA R. 15(g) (2000), erroneously concluded that the youngest child was a child in need of aid, and that Alaska Stat. &sect; 13.26.045, authorizing the superior court to appoint guardians, was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state was awarded temporary custody over the three older children and assumed emergency custody over the youngest child when it was born. The trial court found the youngest child to be a child in need of aid under Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.10.010(a)(2)(A) and appointed guardians for all of the children. The trial court ultimately concluded that the mother was currently unable to provide for the physical, emotional, and social needs of her children. On appeal, the court held that the trial court satisfied the requirements of Alaska CINA R. 15(g) (2000) when it made a finding that the treatment plan was reasonable. Alaska Stat. &sect; 13.26.045 did not satisfy any of the criteria used to determine vagueness and held the statute constitutional. However, because the youngest child was not a child with &quot;no parent, guardian, custodian, or relative caring or willing to care&quot; for her, the trial court's finding that she was a child in need of aid under Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.10.010(a)(2)(A) was erroneous. The court noted that on remand the trial court might find the child to be in need of aid under either Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.10.010(a)(2)(A) or (a)(2)(F).</SPAN></P>

On further review, the court affirmed judgment and held that the consecutive sentences for felony murder and the predicate felony of first-degree robbery did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Alaska Constitutions. The court reasoned that: (1) under an examination of the language and legislative history of the felony-murder statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.110(a)(3), the legislature intended to allow multiple punishments for felony murder and the predicate offense of robbery; (2) the offenses encompassed different constituent elements, in that murder had an element that someone was killed, and robbery had an element of taking or attempting to take another's property; and (3) felony murder was a distinct area of the criminal law not governed by traditional lesser-included offense analysis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged non-resident commercial fishermen higher fees that it charged residents pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.480 and Alaska Admin.

It remanded to the trial court for a determination of the constitutional reasonableness of the higher fees and whether the 3:1 ratio bore a sufficiently close relationship to that goal. The trial court adopted the states pro rata approach. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded because the correct analytical approach for privileges and immunities purposes was the per capita formula suggested by the fishermen, which computed the contribution made by each resident to the cost of maintaining the commercial fisheries and compared that with the fee differential. The court remanded for application of that formula with instructions to consider additional budget figures submitted by the state on appropriate procedural terms and to decide if the fisherman were entitled to recover interest pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 43.15.010, 43.10.210(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Alaska Election Code, Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.25.010 et seq., provided for a blanket primary in which a voter had the right to vote for any candidate regardless of party affiliation.

The government entered into stipulated regulations with the RP that provided a blanket primary ballot, and a party ballot under which only republicans, nonpartisan, and undeclared voters were available to nominate the RP's candidates. The court reversed the summary judgment that upheld the regulations because the blanket primary did not violate the RP's freedom of association rights given the government's legitimate reasons for a blanket primary. While the court agreed that a blanket primary allowed &quot;raid voting,&quot; the court noted that such voting was also possible under the party rule ballot. The court also held that the government's interest in ensuring that elected officials represented the broad cross-section of the population who were mostly nonpartisan or undeclared were compelling in comparison to the RP's assertion to need more control over party discipline to its principles.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the voter's claim for damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guest, a minor, had been drinking at a party at the hosts' home. The guest was paralyzed in a car accident after leaving the party, and he brought a tort action against the hosts. The hosts claimed statutory immunity from civil liability under Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.21.020. The court held that the trial court's grant of summary judgment for the hosts was proper because by its terms, &sect; 04.21.020 applied only to those licensed to sell alcohol. The court reviewed the legislative history of the statute and concluded that it was designed to protect both licensees and non-licensees from tort liability arising from serving alcohol. The fact that Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.16.051(a) criminally prohibited furnishing alcohol to minors did not imply that a minor had a private tort right of action against the alcohol provider. A cause of action implied from a criminal statute, &sect; 04.16.051(a), could not be harmonized with a later statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.21.020, that expressly abrogated civil liability. The statute's purpose was legitimate and there was a fair and substantial relationship between the purpose and the law, so the provision was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that the tax on lodge operators and guides did not deny them equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borough enacted an ordinance that imposed an annual permit fee on lodge operators and professional guides. When the taxpayers refused to pay the tax, the borough filed this declaratory judgment action. The taxpayers argued that the tax was impermissible because it violated the equal protection provisions of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1 because the tax was imposed only on a select group, i.e., lodge owners and guides. On appeal, the court first found that the tax did not affect a fundamental interest or utilize a suspect classification and that it therefore only needed to survive review under the rational basis test. The court then noted that the borough articulated a number of reasons in support of the tax: to encourage new business; to rectify perceived taxation inequities by spreading the charges to businesses which burden services provided by the borough; and to raise revenues. In affirming the trial court, the court determined that the taxpayers failed to present evidence that contradicted the factual basis for the borough's justification for the tax and failed to support their claim that the tax was enacted with no legitimate purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court that the guide and lodge tax did not violate either the United States Constitution or the Alaska State Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that Matanuska-Susitna, Alaska, Borough Code &sect; 17.60, the borough zoning ordinance requiring the permit, was not void for vagueness and therefore did not violate the land club's right to due process of law because there was no history of arbitrary or capricious enforcement of the ordinance. Further, the board rationally could have found that &sect; 17.60 applied to the land club's proposed use and therefore that a conditional use permit was required because there was no evidence of a conflicting contemporaneous construction of the statute by the planning commission.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that: (1) the equal protection guarantee of the state constitution was not violated because Rule 39's challenged provisions served a legitimate purpose and the means employed by Rule 39 were substantially related to the purpose of fair but efficient collection; and (2) Rule 39 did not violate the federal constitutional right to equal protection because the purpose of Rule 39's classification was legitimate and the means chosen were rationally related to that end.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state adopted new procedures for payment of workers' compensation benefits for continuing and multiple treatments of a similar nature through Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.095(c), requiring the physician or health care provider to submit a written treatment plan to the employer and employee within 14 days after treatment began. The statute and its regulations, Alaska Admin. Code tit 8, &sect; 045.082(f) and (g) excused the employer and employee from paying for treatments exceeding the frequency standards if the treatment plan was not furnished within 14 days. The chiropractors claimed that the statute and regulation violated their right to equal protection. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the state. On appeal, the summary judgment in favor of the state was affirmed, and the court determined that there was a logical connection between limiting the process by which physicians and health care providers received payment for repetitive, similar and frequent treatments and the legitimate governmental purposes of ensuring the quick, efficient, fair, and predictable delivery of indemnity and medical benefits to injured workers at a reasonable cost to the employers.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the superior court's decision and ruled that Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 23.30.120(c) and 23.30.265(17) were not unconstitutional. The statutes removed the presumption for compensability of mental injuries and enacted the &quot;extraordinary and unusual&quot; test to define a mental injury. The court ruled that a reasonable basis existed for the legislative action adopting an objective standard to determine whether mental injuries were compensable. Thus, the statutes did not violate the employee's substantive due process rights. The court further ruled that the distinctions under the statutes between physically injured workers and workers with mental injuries was substantially related to the state's legitimate goal of efficiently and fairly distributing benefits while cutting costs for employers.

The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District upheld the statute. The guides appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The guides argued that Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.255(d) violated the Equal Protection Clause and the Uniform Application Clause of the Alaska Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause, the Commerce Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution. The court determined that the trial court correctly found for the state on the guides' constitutional claims. The guides did not have standing, as an Alaska resident, to challenge Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.255(d) under the federal Privileges and Immunities Clause. The guides' Commerce Clause claim also failed, since unharvested game was not an article of interstate commerce and the restriction on his right to guide nonresident hunters was a permissible incidental effect of the regulation. The guides' equal protection claims also fail. Resident and nonresident hunters, and their guides, were not similarly situated with respect to access to the state's wildlife resources. Finally, although the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the guides were not public interest litigants, the court erred in finding that the state was not the prevailing party.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state and the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, sought review of a summary judgment in favor of appellees, Indian tribes and organizations, by the Superior Court of the State of Alaska Third Judicial District Anchorage (Anchorage), which ruled that Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.258(c), violated Alaska Const. art. VII, &sect; 3, 15, 17. The trial court severed Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.258(c), and declared the other claims moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Indian tribes and organizations filed suit against the state and the Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and sought a judicial declaration that the Indian tribes and organizations were entitled to operate a communal set net on a river and that the state was not managing salmon stock in accordance with the subsistence priority as required by law. Nonsubsistence areas were established in 1992 and the Indian tribes and organizations claimed that the nonsubsistence areas violated its members' state constitutional rights under the equal access clauses of Alaska Const. art. VII, &sect; 3,15,17. The trial court found that Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.258(c), was unconstitutional and declared the other claims moot. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded and held that: (1) Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.258(b)(4)(B)(ii), which used the proximity of the domicile of the Tier II subsistence permit applicant to the fish or game population which the applicant wished to harvest as a basis for the applicant's eligibility, violated Alaska Const. art. VII, &sect;&sect; 3, 15, 17, and (2) Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.258(c), without the domicile proximity requirement, was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statutory section that mandated the creation of nonsubsistence areas did not violate the Alaska Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant buyers filed a complaint alleging fraud and breach of contract against appellee sellers on the day that appellees attempted to foreclose on the land at issue. The trial court set aside the foreclosure and dismissed appellants' fraud and contract complaints on the ground that the statute of limitations for each cause of action had run. Appellants challenged the court's dismissal of their claims, and appellees challenged the setting aside of the foreclosure sale. The court concluded that the trial court had not erred in using its equitable powers to set aside the foreclosure sale. The court also held that appellants' fraud claim was subject to Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.10.070, the two-year statute of limitations that began to run when they stopped making payments. The 10-year statute of limitations in Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.10.230 was not applicable because the ownership interest of the property itself was not at issue. The court applied the discovery rule to common law contract causes of action that brought appellants' contract claims within the statute of limitations period. The trial court's judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part and reversed in part because the trial court had authority to use its equitable powers to set aside appellee sellers' nonjudicial foreclosure sale. Appellants' fraud claims were untimely because the discovery of the problem had taken place after the statute of limitations period, but the contract claims were timely due to the application of the discovery rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter challenged regulations that exempted the Republican Party from Alaska's blanket primary statute.

The voter then challenged the legality of next primary election and sought to enjoin the state from making the temporary regulations permanent. The trial court granted summary judgment to the state. The court held that the stipulation was invalid because it declared a law invalid. The court held that neither the stipulation nor the blanket primary statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.25.060, could have upheld the challenged regulations; therefore, the court needed to decide whether &sect; 15.25.060 was constitutional.

The trial court entered judgment in favor of the State and the Lieutenant Governor and dismissed the complaint. The citizens sought review. The court affirmed. The court held: (1) Alaska Const. art.

When a judgment for support arrearages was entered against him seven years later, he filed a motion for relief from judgment in which he sought to terminate the support obligation as to his stepdaughter. The trial court denied the motion, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the ex-husband had entered into an enforceable contractual obligation to support the stepdaughter, creating an exception to the general rule that no such duty existed. Any mistake as to his legal obligation made at the time of the agreement did not warrant modification. The court held that the ex-husband did not provide sufficient evidence of a substantial and material change in circumstances to justify modifying the child support obligation under &sect; 25.24.170 because he did not show how his income had decreased or of how his ex-wife's remarriage had altered her ability to support the stepdaughter.

But the worker was able to sue the third party without jeopardizing the payments the carrier had already made to him. The court concluded that the superior court's decision requiring reimbursement was consistent with the command of &sect; 23.30.015(g). The worker also asserted that &sect; 23.30.015(g) violated substantive and procedural due process. Although he maintained that &sect; 23.30.015(g) was irrational, he acknowledged the legitimacy of its underlying purpose. Thus, the worker could not meet his heavy burden of demonstrating that no rational basis for the challenged law existed. The worker attacked the legislative policy but did not allege that the statute was enforced arbitrarily. Thus, he has failed to state a valid procedural due process claim. The statute implicated no fundamental right. More importantly, there was a rational basis for &sect; 23.30.015 in general and subsection (g) in particular.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the children's guardian, filed the petition to obtain a temporary restraining order and injunction to prevent the mother from releasing certain confidential information. The mother's daughter left a foster home one night and went to a hospital for treatment, alleging that she was just raped by an acquaintance. She further stated that she had been molested twice in the past by her foster father. The mother learned of the incident and went to her legislator and allegedly released confidential information about the incident. The guardian contended that the daughter was upset about the release of the information. On appeal by the mother, the court vacated the trial court's decision. Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.10.092(a) (Michie) was a new section in 1994 that provided that a parent in a child-in-need-of-aid proceeding could disclose confidential information to certain public officials for use in their official capacity. Because the statutory amendment was directly pertinent to the case, the court ordered a vacation of the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the formula contained in Alaska Stat. &sect; 220(a) would result in substantially different compensation rates for workers who appeared to be in important respects similarly situated. The court concluded that the means chosen for determining an injured worker's gross weekly wage did not bear a substantial relationship to that goal of compensating injured workers based on their actual losses. Therefore, the court held that that the Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.220(a) formula violated the equal protection clause of the Alaska Constitution.

The attorney was convicted of criminal contempt and was required to serve a prison term followed by a period of probation. The court denied the attorney's motion to dismiss the bar association's petition and concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the attorney had violation the conditions of his probation. The evidence showed that the attorney appeared in court in his capacity as an officer of the corporation, which was permitted under the district court rules. But given the prohibition against a corporation appearing without counsel and the attorney's appearance and behavior in court and signature on an assignment, it was clearly demonstrated that he was acting in the capacity of an attorney. There was also evidence that the attorney wrote letters of the type an attorney would write on behalf of clients and evidence that he advise a litigant in the course of his divorce. As such, the court revoked the attorney's probation and scheduled a sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court held that even if Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.21.030 stated duties giving rise to tort liability, such liability was nonetheless subject to the rule of immunity expressed in &sect; 04.21.020.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Fourth Judicial District, Fairbanks, granted the motion for summary judgment filed by defendants, State, Governor, and Department of Revenue. Plaintiff residents filed an action that challenged the constitutionality of a 1992 amendment to the permanent fund dividend (PFD) statutes, 1992 Alaska Session Laws ch. 4, &sect; 4. The amendment changed the qualifying date set forth in Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.23.005(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents timed their move to Alaska so that they would qualify for a 1993 PFD. The family arrived on March 25, 1992. On March 31, 1992, the Governor signed the amendment, changed the eligibility requirements for a PFD. As a result, applicants had to show Alaska residency as of January 1, 1992 to be eligible for a 1993 PFD. The residents filed a lawsuit. The trial court granted defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed. Because the challenged amendment derived from a legitimate governmental objective, and the means bore a fair and substantial relation to that objective, the amendment survived minimal scrutiny under Alaska's Constitution. The residents had no property right in a 1993 PFD, thus, there was no due process violation. The amendment did not unfairly or unreasonably impinge upon any property rights or settled expectations. Therefore, the amendment did not violate the prohibition against retroactive legislation. The State had engaged in no conduct encouraging the residents to move or in any way guaranteeing that they would qualify for a 1993 PFD if they arrived in March. The State was not equitably estopped from denying the residents their 1993 PFDs.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the state filed an action in the superior court to recover the deficiency judgment, and the superior court granted the state's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the state was collaterally estopped from relying on the void default judgment. The court further held that the federal court's decision regarding the improper service on the debtor was entitled to preclusive effect as well as full faith and credit because the issue of service of process upon the debtor had been fully litigated by the parties in the federal suit. Finally, the court held that the federal court's interpretation of Alaska R. Civ. P. 4(h) was entitled to full faith and credit and precluded the state from relitigating the issue.</SPAN></P>

XII, &sect; 6 forbade state agencies from seeking to reduce spending by privatizing state jobs. The court affirmed the superior court's entry of summary judgment in favor of the state agency because the merit principle, expressed in art. XII, &sect; 6, allowed state agencies broad discretion to eliminate positions and order layoffs for reasons of efficiency and economy, provided that their decisions were not politically motivated. Although the State Personnel Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 39.25.010-.220, included state jobs as well as state workers within the ambit of the Alaska Constitution's merit system language, the court found that the drafters of the Alaska Constitution made it clear that the merit principle was not intended to impede the efficient management of state affairs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent former governor challenged the constitutionality of Alaska Stat. &sect; 37.10.420, which defined terms governing the legislature's ability to withdraw funds from the budget reserve fund by a simple majority vote. Petitioners, governor, commissioner of revenue, and state, also filed a motion for partial summary judgment, claiming the statute was constitutional. The trial court held that &sect; 37.10.420 was unconstitutional because it unduly limited the funds counted as available for appropriation. The court affirmed on different grounds, holding that the &quot;amount available for appropriation&quot; within the meaning of Alaska Const. art. IX, &sect; 17 included all monies over which the legislature retained power to appropriate and that required further appropriation before expenditure. All amounts actually appropriated, whether or not they would have been considered available prior to appropriation, were available within the meaning of art. IX, &sect; 17.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hunter, who had a valid hunting license, was accustomed to feed his family by bear hunting.

The state later voluntarily dismissed the criminal charges. The hunter brought an action against the State and the Trooper for declaratory relief and damages. The trial court found the regulations invalid and dismissed the hunter's tort claims, and both parties sought review. The court held that: (1) under the Alaska Tort Claims Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.50.250(1), there was no liability because the Trooper had exercised due care in the enforcement of the regulation, even though the regulation was invalid; (2) even if the state agency acted in excess of its authority or failed to comply with the requirements of the statute, it was immune from suit under the discretionary function exception to the statute; and (3) pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.255(b), the state agency had discretionary policymaking authority and not mere ministerial authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the board imposed supplemental conditions of parole on the parolee, he filed a suit against the board, challenging the regulations and procedures under which the conditions were imposed. When the superior court granted the state's motion for summary judgment, the parolee appealed. The court affirmed. The parolee was given an opportunity to be heard and to represent his interests. That was all that due process required. The parolee claimed that due process required 15 days to object, rather than the 10 days which he was given. However, he filed a opposition within four days, did not ask for more time, and did not show how he was prejudiced by the 10-day period. His claim that an unduly short response period violated his due process rights was correctly rejected. A board member who imposed the conditions gave reasons which were minimally sufficient. The board approved all search conditions imposed. The parolee had an opportunity to object to each condition. The purpose of the hearing was different from the hearing given those eligible for discretionary parole. Discretionary and mandatory parolees were not similarly situated. Thus, the parolee's equal protection argument failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate's petition to run for city council was rejected by the city clerk because the candidate had failed to attest that he had been a resident of the city for three years, as required by Kenia, Alaska, City Charter &sect; 2-1(b). After the candidate unsuccessfully filed an action challenging the legality of &sect; 2-1(b), he appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's finding that &sect; 2-1(b) was constitutional. The court held that although the issue was moot, because the election had been held, it would address the constitutional issue raised under the public interest exception to the mootness doctrine. It found that the city was not an indispensable party and that its interests had been represented through the city clerk. The court noted that although the candidate had challenged the residency requirement on federal equal protection grounds, it was more appropriate to analyze the issue based upon the more demanding state equal rights provision of Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1. It found that the right to seek public office was of extreme importance, required the use of a strict scrutiny analysis, and that three years was an unacceptably long time to burden voters' rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department revoked appellant's driver's license after receiving the results of his breath alcohol test, which indicated that his breath alcohol was .106. The hearing officer considered the margin of error inherent in appellant's test result, which meant that his actual breath alcohol content could have been as low as .096, but declined to apply it in appellant's favor. Instead, the hearing officer relied on the arresting officers' testimony that appellant appeared to be intoxicated, to find that appellant's breath alcohol content was .10 or higher at the time of the test. Consequently, the department revoked his license. The superior court affirmed the department's order, and appellant challenged the judgment. The court reversed, concluding that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.15.165(c) did not provide for consideration of other factors or circumstances, such as the appearance and behavior of the individual, in determining whether the person's breath did, in fact, contain the requisite level of alcohol.

The Department argued that the superior court had misallocated its burden of proving the constitutionality of the foreign conviction. The court agreed and reversed the superior court's decision. The court found that even though the superior court had the jurisdiction to consider the validity of the driver's conviction in the foreign jurisdiction it had misallocated the Department's burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state department of revenue (state) challenged a decision by the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which ruled that a regulation defining &quot;state resident&quot; to determine entitlement to the state's permanent fund dividend was invalid. Respondents, illegal aliens, were initially granted such dividends from the state but were later declared ineligible and asked to repay the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that Alaska Admin. Code tit. 15, &sect; 23.615(d), the regulation defining &quot;state resident,&quot; was authorized by statute. It explained that Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.23.015(a) delegated authority to the commissioner to regulate the eligibility of individuals for permanent fund dividends. The court also held that the enacted regulation was constitutional. It explained that the illegal aliens did not fall within any of the categories requiring heightened constitutional scrutiny under the federal Equal Protection Clause. Thus, the state's dividend eligibility requirement only warranted rational basis review. The court believed that the program's permanent residence requirement, as interpreted to require legal residence, was rationally related to the attainment of the legitimate purposes of the statute. In its analysis under the Alaska Equal Protection clause, the court found that limiting the distribution of dividends to those who were lawful permanent residents was rationally related to legitimate objectives of the dividend program and that the limitation was fairly and substantially related to these goals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's decision which invalidated the regulation defining &quot;state resident&quot; for purposes of distributing the state's permanent fund dividend and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

The borough demanded sales tax on gross receipts and assessed an estimated tax plus interest when the taxpayer did not comply. The taxpayer unsuccessfully appealed to the borough assembly and the superior court, and again appealed to the court. The taxpayer alternatively argued that the sales tax applied only to the net proceeds of pull-tab sales, was unconstitutional, and did not apply to pull-tab sales at all. The court reversed the superior court, holding that pull-tabs were intangible property not subject to the borough's sales tax. The court explained that a pull-tab was a contractual right to receive payment in the event the owner received a winning combination of numbers. As such, pull-tabs fit the definition of intangible property. The court noted that the borough's sales tax ordinance could have included pull-tab sales, as the State of Alaska had done in Alaska Stat. &sect; 05.15.184.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a murder trial, the State attempted to compel the testimony of a co-defendant under &sect; 12.50.101, which allowed the State to compel a witness to testify in exchange for immunity from use or derivative use of the compelled testimony. The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional as it violated the self-incrimination right of the co-defendant. Finding no error in the lower courts' judgments, the court affirmed. The scope of the protection against self-incrimination under Alaska Const. art I, &sect; 9 was that: (1) an individual could not be compelled to give testimony unless the State had taken measures to remove the hazard of incrimination; and (2) an individual faced a hazard of incrimination whenever the answers elicited could supported a conviction or could furnish a link in the chain of evidence leading to a conviction. Where the hazard of incrimination had been removed, the privilege against self-incrimination was no longer required. The court held that a grant of use and derivative use immunity did not remove the hazard of incrimination. The State could not meaningfully safeguard against nonevidentiary use of the compelled testimony.</SPAN></P>

However, a redistricting plan required contiguity, compactness, and relative socio-economic integration. The court found that the plan lacked socio-economic integration of the state's communities.

At the time the complaint was filed, associations were in the process of negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement. Municipality argued that the compulsory binding interest arbitration provisions constituted an impermissible delegation of the legislative authority to a politically unaccountable private third party and the provisions in question were unconstitutional as they provided no meaningful standards to guide the arbitrator and did not provide for meaningful judicial review. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of associations and awarded 100 percent of requested attorney's fees to one association and 70 percent of the attorney's fees to the other. Municipality challenged the results, and the court affirmed the judgment while vacating the award of fees. The questioned delegation of the legislative power to an arbitrator was not unconstitutional per se. The arbitrator's authority was limited.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Alaska Const. art. IX, &sect; 7 prohibited the dedication of any tax or license revenues for any special purpose. The issue presented was whether the act that created the Alaska Marine Highway System Fund, Alaska Stat. &sect; 19.65.050-100, violated that provision. The trial court held that it did not because it permitted, but did not require, the legislature to appropriate money from the Fund to the Marine Highway System. On appellate review, the court reversed in part, holding that Alaska Stat. &sect; 19.65.080(b) was unconstitutional, but that it was severable from the remainder of the statute. The offending provision prohibited the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities from seeking appropriations from the Fund except in limited circumstances. The court held that this was merely an indirect way of restricting or earmarking the Fund for the exclusive use of the Marine Highway System. The unconstitutional provision was found to be severable, however, because the remaining provisions were complete and it was presumed that the legislature would have intended them to stand.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and the wife were divorced and the decree of dissolution of marriage made no provision for child support. The wife brought a motion for child support pursuant to Alaska R. Civ.

The trial court ordered the husband to pay child support and the husband appealed, arguing that Alaska R. Civ. P. 90.3 was unconstitutional because it constituted a substantive change in the law. The court ruled that Alaska R. Civ. P. 90.3 did not modify or amend Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.24.160, which allowed courts to set child support awards as could be just and proper for the parties to contribute toward the nurture and education of their children. Further, the court held that Alaska R. Civ. P. 90.3 interpreted Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.24.160 and established guidelines to enable courts to determine what was a just and proper contribution. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that Alaska R. Civ. P. 90.3 did not change the existing case law, and that child support awards still must be fair and equitable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state and board of game, and appellees, hunter and citizen's council, both sought review of an order of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, which invalidated subsistence hunting regulations, Alaska Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect;&sect; 92.012(c) and 92.165, and an all Alaskans policy for first tier subsistence hunting eligibility. The hunter had filed an action for declaratory relief claiming that the regulations were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of game adopted regulations requiring subsistence hunters to purchase a tag prior to hunting for brown bears and to have parts of a killed animal sealed by a state official. These regulations were first adopted to regulate trophy hunting and made applicable to subsistence hunting without a public hearing. The board also adopted a policy that made all Alaskans eligible as first tier subsistence hunters. The trial court invalidated the regulations and the policy. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part, remanding the case with directions to remand it to the board. The court held that the regulations violated both the subsistence preference law, Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.258(c) and the Administrative Procedures Act, Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.255(a) because the board failed to conduct an analysis of the effect that the regulations had on subsistence uses and the board did not conduct a hearing or provide public notice before adopting the regulations. Since Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.05.258 did not provide a basis for distinguishing between beneficial users at the first tier, the court held that the board's All Alaskan policy for first tier eligibility was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the order that invalidated the brown bear tag fee and bear sealing requirements as subsistence regulations and reversed that part of the order invalidating the board of game's All Alaskan first tier eligibility for subsistence hunting. The court remanded the case to the trial court with directions to remand it to the board for the purpose of adopting appropriate subsistence hunting regulations.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought judicial review of the commission's order after appellee denied reconsideration of the order on several grounds. Among them, the court held that there was no error in the appellee's use of a hypothetical capital structure and that its rate of return determinations were adequately supported by facts and a reasonable basis in law. Appellant made no showing that commission's regulatory scheme threatened its financial integrity, so the court concluded that the commission's application of an original cost rate methodology without a transition rate base did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of appellant's property. The court determined that the commission's tariff order was not preempted by 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2 because &sect; 2 was not intended to apply to intrastate rates. Nor did the tariff violate 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 13(4) because appellant failed to establish any evidence that supported its claim that interstate shippers suffered unfair prejudice The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Nothing in the record showed a break in the nexus between the injured party's assault of the trooper and the troopers' instantaneous response thereto with deadly force.

The employee contended that the legislature violated substantive due process by changing the definition of medical stability from the AMA definition to its own definition. The court reversed the superior court's judgment for the employee and concluded that the employee's substantive due process attack on the definition of medical stability articulated by Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.265(21) should be rejected. The court held that the employee failed to meet his heavy burden of demonstrating that no rational basis existed for the definition adopted by the legislature. The court ruled that the legislature adopted a clear definition as to when medical stability was achieved for purposes of the Workers' Compensation Act in its quest to lower costs and facilitate the resolution of disputes.

The superior court dismissed appellants' complaint for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief, which requested invalidation of a ballot proposition that increased a sales tax on alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court denied appellants' motion for summary judgment, which had claimed that appellees' sales tax was illegal under Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.21.010(c). The court held that an ordinance that taxed the sales of alcoholic beverage at a four percent higher rate than the tax on the sale of other commodities violated &sect; 04.21.010(c). The court determined that the text of &sect; 04.21.010(c)(2) failed to clearly indicate if it prohibited the imposition of discriminatory rates of sales taxes on sales of alcoholic beverages. The court found that &sect; 04.21.010(c)(3) and the legislative history regarding a 1985 amendment to &sect; 04.21.010(c) indicated that the amendment prohibited the imposition of discriminatory sales taxes, whether in the form of sales tax rate differentials or a sales tax imposed solely on the sale of alcoholic beverages. Therefore, the court concluded that &sect;&sect; 04.21.010(c)(2) and 04.21.010(c)(3), when read together, barred a municipality from taxing only the sale of alcoholic beverages and also required that if sales taxes were imposed on other commodities, then the rate of taxation on the sale of alcoholic beverages could not exceed the rate on the sales of other commodities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner challenged both the summary judgment and the trial court's award of costs and attorney's fees to the city. The judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that summary judgment under Alaska R. App. P. 602(a)(2) was inappropriate on the owner's claims for damages, her archaeological site claims, and her statutory claims because her complaint was not an administrative appeal. The court determined that there was a material issue of fact as to how much damage to the owner's property was caused by the method by which the city had decided to remove the owner's encroachment. Remand was appropriate for the determination of whether any of the owner's alleged damages to her property were the result of the negligent removal of the fence. The court also held that the owner's non-damage claims failed on the merits. The owner had provided no evidence that demonstrated a discriminatory intent on the part of the city, the owner received all the process that was due, and there was no evidence regarding the finding of an archaeological site.

They sought post conviction relief on the grounds that their convictions under &sect;16.30.010(a) violated due process. The appeals court remanded the matter to the district court for a new trial limited to the issue of whether petitioners acted on a reasonable mistake of law. Upon review, the court held a claim alleging that the statute under which a defendant was convicted was void because it violated due process could be brought at any time because it involved a claim that the complaint did not charge a crime. The court held that the due process claim asserted by petitioners was jurisdictional in nature and rejected the state's contention that petitioners waived their right to challenge their convictions on due process grounds because they did not assert their claims at trial. The court held that Alaska Admin. Code tit. 5, &sect; 92.140, prohibiting a hunter from transporting, or merely possessing, killed game and Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.30.010(a), providing that it was a misdemeanor not to salvage killed game for human consumption, were ambiguous when read in conjunction with each other.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fairbanks, Alaska, Fairbanks Gen. Code Ordinance &sect; 5.401 (1979) provided up to 70 percent of the revenues generated by the bed tax to the bureau. A citizens' group proposed an initiative that removed almost all of the restrictions of the ordinance, which controlled the spending of the revenue. The superior court concluded that the proposed initiative repealed an existing appropriation and granted the bureau's motion for summary judgment. The court reversed the superior court's judgment and held that the initiative was constitutional because the initiative neither made an appropriation nor dedicated funds. Section 5.402 was not an appropriation under Alaska Sta. &sect; 29.35.100 because it did not reflect an action taken by the city after an annual approval of the budget, nor was the ordinance a supplemental or emergency act of the city. The initiative was not an appropriation because it specified no sums to be distributed, no purpose to be funded, and no mandatory process. The initiative did not infringe on flexibility in the budget process or restrict the power of the city council in distributing the bed tax revenues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police chief sought review of a decision from the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which issued an order ruling that the applications of all parties to hold Alaska R. Crim. P. 6.1 unconstitutional were denied. These appeals concerned an investigative grand jury report which was subject to judicial review under Alaska R. Crim. P. 6.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issues raised in these cases were whether Alaska R. Crim. P. 6.1 violated Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 8, and whether the superior court erred in ordering an entire grand jury report released. The court had previously ordered that only a certain section of the report be immediately released. On appeal, the court held that the requirement of rule 6.1 that recommendations be based on substantial evidence elicited in the course of the grand jury's investigation was based both on due process considerations and on the connection between the investigation and the recommendation made in article I, &sect; 8 of the Alaska constitution. The court held that rule 6.1 was constitutional. The court also held that much of the remainder of the grand jury report should have been released. However, the court held that the grand jury's discussion of allegations against certain teachers added little to the comprehensibility of the recommendations. The court held that publication of the discussion would harm the reputations of the teachers. The court, therefore, ordered expunged from the grand jury report all mention of the relevant investigation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered released part II of the relevant grand jury report, with certain deletions. The court also ordered that the final written responses of those interested parties who were still mentioned in the expunged report and who had preserved their right to file such responses be attached as an appendix. The court held that the state rule providing a procedure for judicial review of grand jury reports before release was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

A hearing was held by the commission, which stated that the contracts were special contracts, which were not valid until approved by the commission.

The court determined that under the contracts, the developers were insulated from the tariff changes and should have been compensated for harm suffered because they reasonably relied on the company's knowledge to comply with the commission's regulations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the university adopted a state-wide system, which eliminated the separate administration of the community college, the professors were combined with the university faculty. The professors had no rank or tenure provisions in a prior collective bargaining agreement. Based on years, none of the professors were offered a full professorship. A grievance was filed, but the APA did not govern the new interim procedures. The professors initiated an action, contending that the APA procedures were required and that the contemplated grievance procedures denied them due process. The court reversed the judgment, finding that Alaska Stat. &sect; 44.62.330 et seq. did apply to the university and that its grievance proceedings had to comply with the provisions of the Act. The court found no inconsistency's between the university president's power and the Act. The exclusion of other state personnel from the APA did not conclusively demonstrate that university personnel were similarly excluded. However, because the formal grievance complaint filed by the professors did not explicitly distinguish between legislative facts and administrative facts, remand was necessary.</SPAN></P>

The superior court held the statute violative of &quot;equal protection.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates alleged that &sect; 43.23.005(d) violated the equal protection clause, the due process clause, and the prohibitions against ex post facto laws, bills of attainder, and cruel and unusual punishment in the Alaska and United States Constitutions. The inmates prevailed on only the equal protection challenge. The sole issue before the court was whether the superior court erred in holding that &sect; 43.23.005(d) violated either of the equal protection clauses. Section 43.23.005(d) provided that persons convicted of a felony, who were incarcerated during any period of a fiscal year as a result of the conviction, were ineligible for a permanent fund dividend for that year. The court found that an individual's interest in a permanent fund dividend, like other economic interests, was entitled to minimum scrutiny. Therefore, the State had to show only that its purposes were legitimate and that the challenged statute bore a fair and substantial relationship to the purposes. Because &sect; 43.23.005(d) had a fair and substantial relationship to the legitimate goal of compensating crime victims, the statute did not violate the equal protection clause of either the Alaska or U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The borough's motion to set aside the decision was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation's property was exempt from local taxation pursuant to 43 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1620(d) and Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.45.030 as long as it remained undeveloped or became undeveloped after use. The corporation had previously leased the property to a third party; because the lessee had improved and developed it, the property had been taxed during the tenant's occupancy. The corporation successfully claimed that, after the lease expired, the property was unused and therefore had reverted to an undeveloped state. The trial court declared that the property was exempt so long as it remained unoccupied and idle. In reversing, the court held that the parcel had been so extensively improved that it was necessarily &quot;developed&quot; within the meaning of 43 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1620(d). Because it was developed property, the mere fact that it was not currently leased did not render it &quot;undeveloped&quot; or make it exempt from taxes under Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.45.030. Some additional, tangible change to the property had to occur, such as the destruction or decay of the improvements, for the property to revert to an exempt, undeveloped state. The property remained taxable because no such deterioration had occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, borough and borough assessor, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, which reversed the borough assessor's ruling and which ruled that the properties of appellees, village and corporation, were exempt and awarded actual attorney's fees and sanctions against appellants in appellees' actions for taxes paid by them under protest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the village's appeal as to certain tax years were time barred, but found that appellees' appeals as to other tax years were timely filed. As to the exempt status of the properties at issue, the court held that &quot;developed&quot; as used in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), 43 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1601-1628, included parcels which were not only legally but practically suitable for sale and that Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.45.030 was consistent with ANCSA with respect to the meaning of developed. The definition was broad enough to include appellees' subdivided land which was ready for sale. The court remanded the case for a determination of the status of certain parcels under the appropriate legal standard. The court affirmed the awards of sanctions, but held that under the doctrine of plain error the awards constituted an impermissible double recovery of attorney's fees if both the awards of sanctions and the awards of attorney's fees were allowed to stand. Therefore, the court vacated the awards of attorney's fees on the basis that the trial court's finding of bad faith was based upon an incorrect interpretation of the law.</SPAN></P>

On cross-appeal, the city challenged the denial of its request for attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city employee was terminated and reinstated after filing an appeal to the city personnel board (board). After his reinstatement, his position was eliminated, and his termination was upheld on appeal to the board. Fifteen months later, the employee brought his civil action. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of his action. However denominated, any claim which was functionally an administrative appeal had to be brought within the 30 day limit imposed by Alaska R. App. P. 602(a)(2). All of the employee's claims, except those under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 were functionally appeals from the board's decision, and therefore they were barred by the passage of time. Requiring public employees to bring a timely administrative appeal as a prerequisite to invoking the appellate jurisdiction of the superior court did not create a denial of equal protection. Because the employee's &sect; 1983 claims were essentially the same as those he presented to the board, then issue preclusion prevented re-litigation in state court. Although the city was not entitled to attorney fees under Alaska R. Civ. P. 82, the court remanded for consideration of fees under Alaska R. App. P. 508(e).</SPAN></P>

Code tit. 5, &sect; 27.987 by fishing in a superexclusive use fishery after having fished in another area. They challenged a judgment of the Court of Appeals (Alaska) denying the fishermen's federal constitutional challenges and state equal rights challenged to the regulation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the court of appeals' decision which held that the Board of Fisheries (Alaska) had authority to promulgate superexclusive use regulations, that the regulation did not discriminate on the basis of race in violation of Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and that the regulations violated neither the privileges and immunities clause nor the commerce clause of the federal constitution. With respect to the certified constitutional issues, the court observed that there was no discrimination between residents and nonresidents and that the limitations as to &quot;time and area&quot; and &quot;gear size&quot; were not violative of the Alaska Constitution as only persons, not nets or boats, were entitled to equal rights. Accordingly, the court concluded that the regulation did not violate any Alaska Const. art. VIII clauses. The court further observed that as such regulatory devices were in use when the Alaska Constitution was promulgated, it was impossible to conclude that the framers intended to prohibit this method of regulation upon drafting art. VIII. Further, the regulation, if anything, furthered the interests underlying the common use mandate of art. VIII, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fisherman filed a class action alleging that the state's practice of charging nonresidents three times more than it charged residents for commercial licenses and limited entry permits violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art.

The fisherman also claimed that the CFEC lacked statutory authority to charge differential fees under former Alaska Admin. Code tit. 20, &sect; 05.220(a). The trial court ruled in favor of the state and the CFEC. The court affirmed, in part, and reversed, in part, holding (1) the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to state and the CFEC on the fishermen's constitutional claims because the record was insufficient to permit a determination as to whether the higher fees charged to nonresidents were excessive for the purpose of equalizing the economic burden of fisheries management shouldered by residents and nonresidents, (2) Alaska Admin. Code tit. 20, &sect; 05.220(a) was a proper implementation of Alaska Stat. &sect; 16.43.110(a), which delegated regulatory authority to the CFEC, and (3) the fisherman could seek a refund of the excess payments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city asserted that its disparate tax on the oil and gas property was justified, under Alaska Stat. &sect; 29.45.080, by the higher level of city services provided to the property by the city. On appeal, the court affirmed. It found that the city had the authority to levy a property tax on all real and personal property within the city. The city could levy a tax on oil and gas property, but only at the rate of taxation that applied to other property taxed by the city. Since the language of the statutes relied upon by the parties could not be reconciled, the more specific statute that prohibited the city from taxing oil and gas properties at a higher rate than other city properties governed. Also, as well intentioned as the city might be in its attempt to provide services tailored to the needs of the oil and gas property, the potential for a spillover of benefits to those that did not own oil and gas property was great. In fact, the costs of the public dock for the residents of the city were being paid for by the oil and gas industry and the other residents of the State of Alaska.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The harvester claimed the troopers violated his rights to be free from unreasonable government seizures and to enjoy the rewards of his own industry when they confiscated logs to which both the harvester and a timber company claimed title. The trial court ruled that the relation back doctrine did not apply to the trooper whose identity was unknown when the harvester filed suit and that this trooper did not receive imputed notice under the facts of the case. The trial court also ordered joinder of the timber company as an indispensable party because an adjudication of the central issue of log ownership was required in the case. The court held that the unidentified trooper had imputed notice via the attorney general, which represented all defendants from the outset, and adopted the identity of interest theory as to service upon state law enforcement agencies. The court also held that the order directing joinder of the timber company was an abuse of discretion. The state could not assert any threat to the timber company's interests when it disavowed any interest in the case, and it was unnecessary to join the timber company to determine if it had a property interest in the logs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment for defendants in the harvester's action for constitutional violations because the claim against the state trooper whose identity was unknown at the time that the action commenced was not time-barred. The court also vacated the order that dismissed the complaint with prejudice for the harvester's failure to join the timber company as an indispensable party and remanded the case for further findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 1986 Act's only requirement to be met by a subsistence fisherman or hunter was residency in a rural area of the state. The rural preference was challenged under several provisions of the Alaska Constitution: the common use clause, the no exclusive right of fishery clause, the uniform application clause, the equal rights clause, and the due process clause (Alaska Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 3, 15, 17, respectively). In addition, violation of the equal protection and due process clauses of the United States Constitution was claimed. The court held that the rural preference violated Alaska Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 3, 15, 17. The court found that, although the ramifications of these clauses were varied, they shared the meaning that the exclusive or special privileges to take fish and wildlife were prohibited. The court noted that it did not hold that everyone could engage in subsistence hunting or fishing. The court articulated that only the residency criterion used in the 1986 Act, which conclusively excluded all urban residents from subsistence hunting and fishing regardless of their individual characteristics, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded finding that the residency criterion used in the 1986 Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The contractor cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A public works contractor filed suit against the state seeking a declaration that &sect; 36.10.160 was unconstitutional and damages for its increased costs in complying with the law. The superior court permitted intervention on both sides, and both sides filed motions for summary judgment. The superior court entered partial summary judgment for the contractor after concluding that the preference law violated the equal protection provision of the Alaska Constitution and that the state was not entitled to summary judgment on the issue whether the contractor waived its right to seek damages for the state's enforcement of the law. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the superior court that &sect; 36.10.160 violated the Alaska Constitution and stated that the disparate treatment of unemployed workers in one region in order to confer an economic benefit on similarly situated workers in another region was not a legitimate legislative goal. The court reversed the superior court's determination without deciding the waiver issue, because the contractor did not have the right to seek damages for the enforcement of an unconstitutional law.</SPAN></P>

The default judgment included a preliminary injunction, which enjoined the borough from pursuing foreclosure proceedings against the corporation for nonpayment of real property taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the borough's motion because it found no grounds of mistake, neglect, or fraud and the borough had waived its jurisdictional objection by its voluntary appearance. On appeal, the borough contended that the trial court erred in declining to set aside the default judgment. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that the trial court obtained jurisdiction over the borough under Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.05.010, even though service was defective, when it filed a motion without challenging jurisdiction. The court further held that the trial court did not plainly usurp its power by entering the default judgment. Application of the plain usurpation standard was limited to cases that involved an arrogation of authority that a court clearly lacked. While taking a default judgment without notice was a serious error, it did not render the judgment void. Because the default judgment was taken 30 days after the borough filed opposition to the motion for default judgment, it was not void. Also, where the borough filed opposition to the corporation's application for default judgment, there was a presumed valid application under Alaska R. Civ. P. 55.</SPAN></P>

The state sought review of the finding that the statute was unconstitutional under the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature imposed, under &sect; 21.09.210, a tax on foreign insurers on premiums for the insurance of property or risks within the state. After the statute was repealed, the insurer requested a refund, which was denied by the state. The insurer appealed to the trial court the state's denial of refund. The court affirmed the trial court's finding of unconstitutionality but reversed the denial of refund and remanded. The court held that: 1) &sect; 21.09.210 failed to meet the federal rational basis test and the state's stricter test because the tax was a discrimination lacking any legitimate state purpose; 2) the state failed to present any evidence to support its claim that the tax advanced any of its stated purposes; and 3) because the insurer did not make a formal protest, it was entitled to a refund only if the state waived the protest requirement of Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.15.010; thus remand was required to determine if a waiver occurred and if the insurer's claim was made timely. The court overruled State v. Wakefield Fisheries, Inc., 495 P.2d 166 (Alaska 1972), to the extent that it held that a formal protest was not required to maintain an action in assumpsit for a tax refund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the differential premium tax was unconstitutional.

The court so held, despite its recognition of efforts by the natural father and the natural father's family to discourage communication between the natural mother and the minor child.

An investigation and hearing resulted, and the Commissioner held the employer liable for premiums. On judicial review, the trial court affirmed, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The hearing was not procedurally inadequate due to inadequate notice of the scope of the hearing, and the hearing officer did not lack impartiality. The Commissioner did not abuse its discretion in finding that the employer's workers were employees rather than independent contractors, where the employer did not produce clear evidence that all three prongs of Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.20.525(a)(10) were met as to any of the workers. The court noted that the fact that several employees had business licenses was not sufficient to make them independent contractors.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer filed a complaint in the superior court seeking a declaration that the department lacked the authority to increase disputed tax assessments after three years had passed from the date the tax return was filed. The superior court dismissed the declaratory judgment action on the ground that the taxpayer would first have to exhaust available administrative grievance procedures before seeking a judicial remedy. The taxpayer appealed and the court affirmed, holding that the taxpayer did indeed fail to exhaust available administrative remedies before seeking judicial review of the department's actions. Further, it appeared highly possible that the department would find the 1985 assessment valid under Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.05.260. On the record before the court, a decision adverse to the taxpayer's interest did not appear to be a certainty. The court therefore held that the &quot;futility&quot; exception to the doctrine of administrative exhaustion did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual filed an action against the corporation seeking damages for an alleged breach of a lease. The corporation filed a motion to require the individual to post a cost bond, asserting that the individual was not a resident of the state. The trial court ordered a stay of the proceedings until the individual posted a bond to cover the corporation's anticipated costs and attorney fees. On petition for review, the court held that the bond, as required by Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.60.060, violated the individual's equal protection rights. The court determined that the individual's right to access to a court was an important right that was deserving of close scrutiny. The corporation claimed that the purpose of the statute was to provide security for attorney fees that might be awarded against the individual, from whom it might be difficult to collect because of his non-residence. The court stated that the means of effectuating this purpose were not sufficiently well tailored to its ends. The court found that the statute was overinclusive because it assumed that all non-residents would be uncooperative in paying cost and attorney fee awards entered against them.</SPAN></P>

The guide had spent considerable money on cabins and challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court held that the exclusive guide areas and joint use areas fell within the category of grants prohibited by the common use clause. These areas allowed one guide to exclude all other guides from leading hunts professionally in his area.

Overruling prior case law, the court held that the University's action should have been barred by the statute of limitation in Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.45.240. However, the suit was not barred because conditions did not favor retroactivity of its ruling. The inclusion of the third sentence caused the initiative to make an appropriation by designating the use of state assets in a manner that was executable, mandatory, and reasonably definite with no further legislative action. The court severed the impermissible portion because it found that, when standing alone, the remainder enacted law; deleting the impermissible portion did not substantially change the spirit of the measure; and that it was evident from the content of the measure and the circumstances surrounding its proposal that the sponsors and subscribers would prefer the measure to stand as altered.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the Department's petition and terminated the parents' rights. The parents appealed. The court found, based on the parties' stipulation, that there was clear and convincing evidence that the children were in need of aid under &sect; 47.10.080(c)(3) and Alaska Stat. &sect; 47.10.010(a)(2)(A) as a result of the conduct of the parents.

The CFEC classified her application at four verified points under its priority classification system and issued her a non-transferable entry permit, which cannot be sold, inherited, or even given away. She objected, claiming among other things that her 1971 and 1972 participation in the Bristol Bay fishery as a crew member entitled her to two additional points and therefore a freely transferable entry permit. The CFEC denied her points for crew participation in those years because she did not have a commercial fishing license. She appealed. The superior court affirmed the CFEC's denial of past crew participation points. She again appealed. The court held that the applicant's claims were not yet ripe for review, but it concluded that the CFEC's failure to consider the applicant's dependence on others has the potential to result in unjust discrimination. Accordingly, it remanded the action to the CFEC for explicit determination as to whether the factual circumstances relating to the application for crewing points warrant granting an exception to the licensure requirement.</SPAN></P>

The superior court granted summary judgment to the CFEC and the state. The court remanded the case with instructions to order the CFEC to begin the optimum number process. The court affirmed the superior court's judgment in all other respects. The CFEC erred in establishing a maximum number of permits that was lower than the highest number of units of gear fished in the four years prior to the limitation date because the CFEC was obligated to select the maximum number by reference to past participation at the fishery. Because the CFEC actually issued more permits through hardship exceptions than it should have set as a maximum, the error did not mandate reversal.

The husband contended that dividing his PERS account by use of a QDRO unconstitutionally diminished his retirement benefits. In affirming the decree, the court held that the use of the QDRO did not increase his liability to the wife or affect his other substantive rights; thus, it was proper for the trial court to have applied retroactively an amendment to Alaska Stat. &sect; 39.35.500, which permitted the assignment of retirement benefits pursuant to a QDRO.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior appeal in the citizen's class action, the court determined that Alaska's Longevity Bonus Program violated equal protection.

On appeal, the citizen argued that damages were available either under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, directly under the United States Constitution, or under the state constitution. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that: (1) damages against the state were not available under &sect; 1983 because a state was not a &quot;person&quot; subject to liability within the meaning of &sect; 1983; (2) damages were not available for the state's violation of the federal or state constitutions because in the absence of a statute allowing such damages, it was not appropriate for the judiciary to assess damages against a state on the ground that the legislature enacted a law later held unconstitutional; (3) damages were not available against the state official in her official capacity because in that capacity she was indistinguishable from the state; and (4) damages were not available against the state official personally because there was no wrongful individual action on her part.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electric utility filed a request for a rate increase with the Alaska Public Utilities Commission. The Commission concluded that 50 percent of the dues paid by the electric utility to a utility association were for lobbying, and excluded lobbying expenses from the electric utility's revenue requirement. The Commission allocated 100 percent of the cost to the electric utility and included attorney's fees of the attorney general as cost. The superior court affirmed the Commission on all substantive issues, but remanded the case for a determination of the specific proportion of the dues actually used for lobbing purposes. On appeal, the court held that: (1) under its general authority to establish just, fair, and reasonable rates, it was not unreasonable for the Commission to exclude lobbying expenses from the electric utility's revenue requirements; (2) under Alaska Stat. &sect; 42.05.651(a), it was not proper to permit the Commission to recovery for routine services rendered by the attorney general's office; and (3) the Commission abused it discretion when it awarded 100 percent of the cost to the electric utility without an individualized consideration of the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee hurt his back in an airplane crash. The employee was temporarily disabled, and subsequently returned to work. The employee continued to work and years later was forced to retire for medical reasons.

The Worker's Compensation Board held that the disability benefits must be computed based on his average weekly earnings at the time of his accident. The employee sought review. The trial court affirmed. The court reversed. The court held: (1) the limitation on earnings contained in Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.175(b) (1962), was one that the legislature intended to be applied unless its application lead to a grossly unfair result; (2) the Board unfairly applied a formula to the employee, which did not fairly achieve the legislature's goal of awarding injured employees an amount reasonably representing their future earnings capacity; (3) it was grossly unfair to apply the maximum limitation under Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.170(b); and (4)&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.170(b) was not to be applied when it negated the legislative intent of Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.220(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature passed 1987 Alaska Sess. Laws 9 with the express intention of validating the governor's impoundment orders that had been rendered void by an earlier judgment of the court. The court found that 1987 Alaska Sess. Laws 9 did not grant the governor sweeping power over the entire budget with no guidance or limitation, as did Alaska Stat. &sect; 37.07.080(g)(2), which was held unconstitutional in the earlier judgment. The court rejected the borough's argument that 1987 Alaska Sess. Laws 9 was unconstitutional for the same reasons that Alaska Stat. &sect; 37.07.080(g)(2) was unconstitutional. The court found that 1987 Alaska Sess. Laws 9 did not unconstitutionally impair any vested rights. The court rejected the borough's claimed violations of due process and equal protection. The court held that there was no bar to enforcement of 1987 Alaska Sess. Laws 9 as a valid curative act. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment because 1987 Alaska Sess.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States District Court for the District of Alaska certified two questions to the court: Should the rule of law recognizing a minor child's independent cause of action for loss of parental consortium resulting from injuries tortiously inflicted on her parent by a third person, be applied retroactively? If so, should the minor's tolling statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.10.140, be applied to such claims?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee sought to add his minor children as plaintiffs in a count for loss of parental consortium to his action to recover damages for injuries suffered at work. Defendant employer argued that the rule of law recognizing loss of parental consortium should not be applied retroactively and that, if it were, limitations barred the action. The court answered both questions in the affirmative. The court held that the new rule of law applied retroactively because special circumstances did not warrant a departure from the general rule of retroactivity, but the court limited its retroactive application due to concerns about the effects on the administration of justice and the fairness of requiring defendants to reopen files involving 20-year-old accidents. The court rejected in advance the argument that it was not feasible to join minors' claims with their parents' claims because the cause of action was not yet recognized. The court held that the language and logic of Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.10.140, read together with the general tort limitations statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.10.070, demanded that limitations be tolled until a child reached the age of majority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the new rule of law recognizing an independent cause of action for loss of parental consortium was to apply retroactively. The court held that minor children's actions for loss of parental consortium grounded in accidents occurring before the rule was announced were barred if one or both parents brought an action based on the accident and the action was concluded by settlement or judgment, unless joinder was not feasible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal in two factually similar criminal cases, the State sought review of decisions of the Court of Appeals (Alaska), which held that Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.10.020(c) was an unconstitutional ex post facto law insofar as it extended the statute of limitations for prosecutions under Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 11.41.410-11.41.460.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases, defendants were indicted for sexual abuse of a minor, in violation of the former Alaska Stat. &sect; 11.41.410(a). At the time of the offenses, the applicable statute of limitations was five years pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.10.010. The legislature subsequently enacted Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.10.020(c), which enlarged the limitations period. The legislature expressly provided for &sect; 12.10.020(c) to have a retroactive effect. Defendants sought to dismiss their indictments on grounds that they were untimely under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.10.010 and that Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.10.020(c) was an unconstitutional ex post facto law. The trial court and the court of appeals agreed. On appeal, the court held that the extension of a criminal statute of limitations before the original period of limitation had run was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law under the state or federal constitutions.The court reasoned that the extension of the statute of limitations was merely a procedural change that did not increase the punishment for the offense or alter the elements of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole bidder on a contract to lease office buildings to a state government challenged summary judgment in favor of the state in an action to enforce the contract. The state rescinded the contract after the state attorney general advised that the contract was void because of irregularities in the manner by which it was obtained. The undisputed facts established that the bidder and the state governor's staff circumvented the competitive bidding process by highly improper means. For instance, the bidder received a draft Request for Proposal that was never released to the public, and changes negotiated between the bidder and the governor's staff made the bidder the only potential bidder who met the requirements. The bidder argued that the contract was ultimately awarded on a &quot;sole source&quot; basis. The appellate court affirmed summary judgment in favor of the state because the use of private negotiations to award government contracts invited favoritism, extravagance, fraud, and corruption.The appellate court held that in order to promote honest competition on an equal basis, the state could not be allowed to use the sole-source process to circumvent competitive bidding requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment order in favor of the state was affirmed because the award of a public contract to a bidder was improper where the bidder received an unfair competitive advantage over other bidders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners contended that Alaska's six-year statute of repose for actions against design professionals, Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.10.055, violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Alaska Constitution. The lower court agreed with the property owners and the court affirmed. The court held that the property owners had standing because they were precluded from asserting their own rights against defendants who might otherwise be liable. The property owners claimed the statute violated equal protection because it failed to protect owners, tenants, and materialmen, while protecting others who were similarly situated, such as architects, planners, engineers, and construction contractors. The court agreed and noted that one effect of the statute of repose was to eliminate the statutory right of contribution among tortfeasors because a plaintiff could not recover against design professionals. The court concluded that there was no substantial relationship between exempting design professionals from liability, shifting liability for defective design and construction to owners and material suppliers, and the goal of encouraging construction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation encouraged its employees to authorize that money be withheld from their paychecks for the purpose of contributing to a political committee that was partially controlled by the corporation's chairman. The commission imposed a civil penalty against the corporation pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 15.13.125, for failing to report the campaign contributions that were made under the employee withholding plan. The trial court affirmed the commissions' decision. Upon review, the court remanded. The court held the payroll contribution plan constituted &quot;joint action&quot; under Alaska Stat. 15.13.130(4) where the corporation actively participated in determining which candidates would receive the pool of funds from the employees. The court found the corporation was not exempt from filing the reports due to an erroneous statement made by an official who was acting on behalf of the commission where the mistake was subsequently corrected. The court concluded new penalties were improperly assessed against the corporation because Alaska Admin. Code tit. 2, &sect; 50.390(g) prohibited the accrual of new penalties until 30 days after the corporation was notified that its appeal was denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, which affirmed the administrative decision of appellee state department of revenue (DOR) that the taxpayer failed to prove unfair taxation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a large corporation with worldwide income, first argued that it should have been allowed to deduct the income taxes levied on oil produced in KINEVA countries. The court held that when a state sought to tax a multi-state or multi-national business, it must determine the amount of income that was properly allocable to in-state activities according to a three-factor apportionment formula in the Multistate Tax Compact, Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.19.010 (1970). The court determined that the taxpayer had not established that no portion of the foreign levy was an income tax. Further, there was not clear and cogent evidence showing that the income attributed to the state was out of all appropriate proportions to the business transacted in the state. In Alaska, foreign income taxes were neither deductible, under Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.20.031(c), nor creditable, under Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.20.036(a). The taxpayer also argued that its non-producing oil leaseholds located in the state should be valued at zero for the purpose of computing the fraction of the taxpayer's income allocable to the state. However, the court held that there was no proof of due process or commerce clause violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that the DOR's failure to grant relief to the taxpayer was not unconstitutional. The DOR had the authority and discretion to determine the amount of state income, absent clear and cogent evidence that the income was generated by business transacted out of the state.</SPAN></P>

The state alleged that it had title due to a prior foreclosure pursuant to the Land Registration Law, Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 34.10.010-.240 (1978), which was designed, in part, to return abandoned land to that state. The first claimant asserted that he had title because he was the assign of the record owner at the time of foreclosure, and that the state wrongfully refused to allow him to repurchase the properties. The second claimant asserted title on the basis of adverse possession. At trial, the superior court entered judgment for the state. The court affirmed, holding that the superior court correctly affirmed the decision of the Department of Natural Resources that denied the first claimant's applications to repurchase the land because the claimant failed to clearly establish who the record owner was at the time of disclosure. The court also upheld the superior court's finding that the second claimant had no standing to challenge the state's prior foreclosure action, and that such challenged was barred by the doctrine of laches.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the injured claimed that the provision in Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.55.536, which permitted submitting her case to an expert advisory panel, impaired her right to a jury trial because introduction of the panel's report into evidence would undercut the jury's role as the trier of fact. However, the court held that admissibility of a panel report did not impinge upon the right to a jury trial because the evidence only established a rebuttable presumption, and therefore, did not cut off any defenses, interposed no obstacle to a full contestation of all of the issues, and took no question of fact from either the court or the jury. The injured further argued that Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.55.536, denied her right of due process. However, the court held that substantively, the statute had a reasonable relationship to the legitimate governmental purpose of alleviating the effects of the malpractice insurance crisis, and procedurally, she was given a full opportunity to litigate her position before a jury. The injured further argued that Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.55.536, denied her right to equal protection.

The individual thereafter filed suit alleging that the DOR knew or should have known of the discharge and that it acted maliciously and/or negligently in attempting to satisfy the judgment. The superior court dismissed the action. The court affirmed, holding that the DOR was immune from a claim of malicious prosecution under Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.50.250(3).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant challenged the trial court decision as it affirmed the Board's calculation of the applicant's permanent total disability benefits. The applicant argued that the Board erred in calculating his permanent total disability benefits under the statute in effect at the time of his injury and asserted that the statute in effect at the time of his disability should have been used to calculate his benefits. The court determined that the Board's calculation of the applicant's benefits was grossly unfair because of the great disparity between his average weekly wage at the time of his injury and the time of his disability. The Board improperly refused to apply Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.220(3), which required the Board to address the fairness and undue hardship posed by the calculation procedures set forth in Alaska Stat. &sect; 23.30.220(2). Since the calculation of the applicant's benefits under &sect; 23.30.220(2) caused an undue hardship on the applicant, the court directed the Board to recalculate the amount of benefits the applicant was entitled to receive by applying his average weekly wage at the time of his disability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reapportionment plan had the effect of creating a new state house district and a new state senate district. On appeal, the court partially affirmed and partially reversed the decision below. The realignment effectuated consistent and rational state policies by retaining a certain district in order to promote social and economic integration. Therefore, it did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of either the Federal or Alaska Constitution. The creation of the new house district satisfied the socio-economic integration requirement of Alaska Const. art. VI, &sect; 6 because the communities were relatively close geographically and were connected by a common hub. However, the new senate district violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Alaska Constitution, which imposed a stricter standard than its federal counterpart when no fundamental right was a stake, because the district was deliberately fashioned to dilute the voting power of Anchorage voters. Had truly proportionate representation been employed, Anchorage would have received an additional district. Therefore, that portion of the judgment was subject to reversal.</SPAN></P>

The jury found her guilty but mentally ill under Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.47.030(a). The court of appeals reversed the conviction on the ground that one of the jury instructions merged the insanity defense with the element of mens rea required for a robbery conviction, making it impossible to determine whether the jury actually found that defendant acted with the requisite mens rea. The court of appeals also ruled that Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.47.010(a) encompassed both prongs of the traditional M'Naghten insanity test. The court reversed the court of appeal's ruling on the insanity test and remanded for a new trial. The court held that when the legislature enacted &sect; 12.47.010(a), it intended to incorporate only the first prong of the M'Naghten test, which allowed defendant to be found not guilty by reason of insanity if she did not understand the basic nature and quality of her conduct. If the legislature had intended &sect; 12.47.010(a) to encompass the second prong, a defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her conduct, it would have had little reason to enact Alaska Stat. &sect; 12.47.030(a) defining &quot;guilty but mentally ill.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Petitioners suffered work-related injuries in Alaska, filed claims, were paid temporary total disability compensation, and resided outside of Alaska.

At a nonjury hearing, the trial court ordered the representation by a specified date or risk jail for contempt until such time as he undertook the representation. The attorney sought a reconsideration of the order. On reconsideration, the contempt was reaffirmed. The attorney appealed, arguing, inter alia, that requiring an attorney to represent an indigent defendant without reasonable compensation was a taking of private property for a public use under the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 18. The court, overruling its prior decisions, held that a court appointment compelling an attorney to represent an indigent criminal defendant was a taking of property for which just compensation was required.

The borough brought suit, contending that Alaska Stat. &sect; 37.07.080(g)(2), permitting the governor to withhold appropriations if there were insufficient receipts and surpluses, was unconstitutional because it improperly delegated a legislative function and it lacked standards to guide the exercise of administrative discretion. The trial court held that &sect; 37.07.080(g)(2) was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power because it authorized the exercise of sweeping power over the entire budget with no guidance or limitation and the governor's limited exercise of authority could not save the statute.

According to the court, the minimum contact requirement was satisfied because defendant solicited plaintiff's performance by giving plaintiff assurance of payment, the offer was accepted in Alaska and performance was rendered in Alaska.

The homeowner appealed the award of attorney's fees, and the court remanded the case to the superior court because it was unclear if the superior court had considered Alaska Stat. &sect; 34.35.005(b), the statute covering attorney's fees in lien actions, when making its award. The court also awarded the contractor $ 750 in attorney's fees for the cost of the appeal. The contractor filed a petition for a rehearing arguing that the attorney's fee award for the appeal was not reasonable. The court granted the petition for rehearing and found that the legislative purpose of &sect; 34.35.005(b) was better served if the statute was construed to include attorney's fees on appeal. The court concluded that it depended on the circumstances of the case as to which court should award the attorney's fees for appellate proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the former assistant attorney failed to establish that the state former employer terminated him in violation of his right to free speech because the speech at issue was not a matter of public concern, but instead was an essentially personal employment dispute. The court found that the dispute did not rise to the level of being a matter of public concern where the former assistant attorney's letter referring to &quot;problems&quot; with a supervisor did not specify details or seek to bring to light actual or potential wrongdoing or breach of public trust. The court concluded that the lower court properly found that the conflict between the supervisor and the former assistant attorney was about internal management.

The defendant claimed that the Board of Gaming failed to differentiate between subsistence hunting and other hunting, and the trial and appellate courts agreed, holding that &sect; 16.05.255(b) required separate subsistence regulations. The trial court allowed defendant to plead a subsistence defense because the board did not adopt any subsistence regulations. The court reversed, although there was legislative history showing an intent for separate regulations, there was no evidence of an intent to grant any personal right to take or possess game in the absence of such regulations. The court held that defendant could not act as though he were unregulated, simply because the agency had failed to promulgate regulations. The court remanded, however, to the trial court for a determination of whether defendant's conduct constituted a &quot;dire emergency&quot; pursuant to Alaska Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One defendant was convicted of two counts of manslaughter while the other defendant was convicted of three counts of third degree assault. The Court of Appeals (Alaska) allowed only one sentence to each defendant for the multiple counts. The state petitioned for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state requested that the court modify or overrule its prior holding that separate punishments for multiple deaths resulting from a single criminal act were impermissible. The court granted the state's requested relief and held that the state's double jeopardy clause was not violated by multiple sentences for multiple violations of a single statute. The court found that the legislature had defined manslaughter and third degree assault to include responsibility for reckless behavior, and had sought to hold people criminally responsible for the results of their behavior that were within the scope of the risk created by that behavior. It was within the legislature's authority to define and punish the crimes because their actions were within constitutional limits. The court ruled that its prior holding improperly focused on the accused's intent instead of on the consequences. When more than one person was victimized during a single incident, the statutes' prohibition against causing the death or injury of another person was violated several times over. The court affirmed the consecutive sentences imposed by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the consecutive five-year presumptive terms imposed on the defendant convicted of manslaughter counts. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the defendant convicted of third degree assault counts should serve consecutive sentences, but remanded his case to the appellate court for consideration of other points.</SPAN></P>

The state and the union appealed. The court ruled that the findings of the trial court were not clearly erroneous and were not to be disturbed on appeal, Alaska R. Civ. P. 52(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, in pertinent part, the court reversed the trial court's ruling that Alaska Stat. &sect; 25.23.130(a) was unconstitutional as applied to the case because it did not provide adopted children with equal protection of the laws. The court held that the trial court did not (1) indicate a discriminatory classification, (2) explain what protected right might be discriminatorily infringed, nor (3) present any analytical basis for the ruling. In addition, the court held that the trial court erred in excluding the grandparents from participating in the hearing regarding the foster parents' adoption petition. The court held that, had the grandparents been allowed to intervene, the court might not have found that the adoption by the foster parents was in the children's best interests. However, the court also held that in making the determination of what was in the children's best interest, the trial court could consider the length and quality of time spent by the children with their foster parents. As a result, the court vacated the trial court's ruling that &sect; 25.23.130(a) was unconstitutional, vacated the adoption decree, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' incriminating statements obtained during custodial interrogation were only partially recorded and they sought suppression because the police had violated the rule announced in an earlier decision requiring that statements be electronically recorded in full whenever feasible. Although no satisfactory explanations were given for the rule's violation, the statements were admitted and both defendants were convicted. The court held that defendants' due process rights under Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 7, were violated and suppression of the statements was required. Compliance with the recording rule was not unduly burdensome on the police, and the contention that the presence of operating recording equipment exerted a chilling effect on an accused's willingness to speak was entitled to little weight, given the constitutional right to silence. The integrity of the judicial system was promoted by determining the admissibility of confessions on the basis of objective evidence rather than the testimony of interested parties. Exclusion was warranted because defendants' ability to present their defenses was impaired by an arbitrary failure to record their statements in full.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife was admitted through the emergency room, complaining of pain to her mid-back and pelvis. The doctor who examined her had discharged her. She later died at home, in her husband's presence, due to a collapsed lung caused by the jagged edge of a fractured rib. The husband then sued the doctor, the emergency association, and the hospital. The defending parties then made a motion for appointment of an expert advisory panel pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 09.55.536. The husband had made a motion to dismiss the panel or for permission to commence discovery because the panel was not appointed within the term prescribed in &sect; 09.55.536.

On appeal, the court held that the prohibition on discovery had to be lifted at the end of 80 days, whether or not the expert advisory panel had issued a report, assuming that the party wishing to begin discovery was not responsible for any significant delay. The court noted that the inclusion of time limits in &sect; 09.55.536 indicated that the purpose was to encourage a prompt determination of the claims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant oil companies challenged the constitutionality of the Oil and Gas Corporate Income Tax (Oil Tax), Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.21 (repealed 1982), and sought a refund of taxes paid under the Oil Tax to appellee State. The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, rejected the oil companies' claims of unconstitutionality and granted the State's motion for summary judgment. The oil companies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Oil Tax, separate accounting was implemented to calculate how much of the oil companies' production and pipeline transportation income was subject to State taxation. The oil companies argued that the State, as a matter of constitutional law, had to use the formula apportionment method, and that the Oil Tax was not separate accounting. The court held that the Oil Tax operated as a separate accounting system for dividing income, distinct from both the specific allocation by situs and formula apportionment methods and that accurate and fair allocation was the legislature's goal in enacting the Oil Tax. The court held that separate accounting did not violate the due process, commerce, contract, or equal protection clauses of the federal Constitution or the equal protection clause of the State constitution. The court held that, because two-thirds of the legislature voted to make the Oil Tax Act immediately effective, as required by Alaska Const. art. II, &sect; 18, Alaska Stat. &sect; 01.10.070(a), a separate two-thirds vote was not required to make the Oil Tax retroactive. The approval of 11 senators was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

The representatives had challenged the state legislature's confirmation of the officials who had been appointed by the governor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representatives denied the confirmation of the officials by adjourning the legislature. The senate did not concur in the adjournment, and the governor issued a widely disseminated proclamation calling for a joint session at which the confirmations were to proceed. The confirmations were objected to for lack of a quorum. The confirmations were affirmed. The representatives filed suit and the trial court dismissed the case, finding nonjusticiability. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding first that the nonjusticiability doctrine did not apply to the issue of a quorum because that question was a question of constitutional law. The court then held that joint sessions of the legislature were intended to organize the legislature into a unicameral session, and the quorum required was only that of a majority of the members of the legislature. Conversely, whether the legislative rules had been violated at the joint session was a nonjusticiable question because it arose out of the legislature's rulemaking powers. Finally, the court held that there was reasonable notice given by the governor as required by the constitution, because the notice was immediately published and distributed.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the district declined to attend a scheduled hearing, arguing that the Department's jurisdiction had expired.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The transferees sold their business and included a liquor license. The buyers executed a security agreement on the property and gave the transferees power to retransfer the liquor license to themselves if the buyers defaulted. As a result of the buyers' accumulated debt, the transferees declared a default and applied to retransfer the license. The Board ultimately found that newly enacted Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.11.360(4)(B), which repealed and replaced Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.10.330(b), permitted such a transfer while the former statute did not. The trial court reversed. On appeal, the court held that: (1) application of Alaska Stat. &sect; 04.11.360(4)(B) would give pre-enactment conduct a different legal effect from that which it would have had absent enactment of the statute, (2) &sect; 04.11.360(4)(B) did not expressly declare its retrospective operation, and (3) the trial court properly refused to apply &sect; 04.11.360(4)(B) retrospectively because to do so would violate the prohibition of Alaska.

Pursuant to Alaska Admin. Code tit. 20, &sect; 05.630(b)(3)(C), the fisher's gear ownership claim depended upon his alleged ownership of a usable purse seine, including a usable net, on January 1, 1973. The income dependence claim depended on his assertion that he had been a de facto gear license holder during 1972, and that this entitled him to income dependence points under the Commission's regulations and interpretive decisions. Alaska Admin. Code tit. 20, &sect; 05.630(b)(1). On appeal, the court ruled that the hearing officer's findings on the gear ownership claim were not supported by substantial evidence. The court also ruled that the hearing officer's findings on income dependence were supported by substantial evidence.

The legislators commenced an action against the media company and state officials.

They sought to enjoin performance of the contract. The trial court dismissed the legislators' complaint for want of a justiciable question. The legislators appealed from that judgment, which was affirmed. The court noted that the 1983 Legislative Session had been completed. While the doctrine of mootness was, in general, inappropriate in cases that involved the Act, the court applied the mootness doctrine because the Council was subject to the sole direction and control of the legislature. Furthermore, the legislature possessed the direct authority to cure the alleged violation and to prevent future violations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fisherman was denied a salmon drift gillnet fishing limited entry permit because he failed to obtain the required 16 points under Alaska Admin.

The regulation was unconstitutional because the use of census districts did not bear a fair and substantial relation to the determination of the availability to an applicant of alternative occupations. The record provided no justification for the CFEC's decision to use census districts. Persons such as the fisherman were automatically allocated fewer points for availability of alternative occupations because they were located in one of the more populous census districts, in spite of their residence in a small isolated coastal town dependent upon fishing. The classification was in this respect impermissibly underinclusive. And because persons who were located within less populous census districts were automatically awarded the maximum point allotment, despite their proximity to a major urban center across the census district boundary, the classification was impermissibly overinclusive.</SPAN></P>

The employee brought an action against the state and her former managers for wrongful termination in violation of her right to free expression. The superior court ruled in favor of the employee but denied her attorney's fees. On review, the court affirmed the superior court judgment but remanded the case for a redetermination of attorney's fees because the court found that the employee was the prevailing party under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The state asserted that the employee was under a contract that required her remain non-partisan. However, the court found this contract to be a prior restraint and any system of prior restraint of expression came to the court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity. The court concluded that the mere possibility of a loss of legislative confidence for the employee's statements was insufficient to meet the material and substantial disruption requirement. Thus, to the extent that the employee's firing was based on her past statements, it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission authorized the air taxi to maintain two bases, but it never authorized one in Anchorage. The Commission argued that the reasonable basis test had to be used, while the air taxi argued that the independent judgment test applied because the issue was statutory construction. The court agreed with the air taxi, declining to defer to the agency, but it was persuaded by the Commission's argument that if the legislature only intended to regulate bases, there was no need to define supplemental bases; therefore, the air taxi's analysis made those superfluous. The court held that supplemental bases also required approval; however, it found that the Commission's proposition that they included any location other than an approved base, including where an air taxi flew to after leaving its base, violated commercial free speech. The court concluded that the air taxi had a valid operating certificate and was authorized for air commerce between its base and any in-state location, but the substantial interest test had not been met to limit the air taxi's right to solicit customers to return to its base, and restricting that right inhibited economical and efficient service.</SPAN></P>

The court determined the senator's conversations with the governor were acts in preparation for the performance his duties as a senator, thus they were privileged. The representative suggested there should be an exception to the rule of privilege for unconstitutional behavior in preparation for legislative acts, which did not involve criminal conduct. The court declined to adopt this suggestion. The representative contended that even if the conversations were privileged the senator who was not a party in the underlying action, could not assert privilege.

Moreover, the court held that the fact that the studies increased the value of the property was not reason to preclude the owners from the benefit of that enhanced value. The panel correctly assessed the value of the property leased from the city and the owners' obligation to the Army Corps of Engineers to restore the property to its condition before the owners had applied for permission to build a barge dock. The court also affirmed the finding that Alaska Stat. &sect; 09. 55.44(a) unconstitutionally fixed the pre- and post judgment interest rate in &quot;quick take&quot; condemnations at six percent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with tampering with physical evidence and the trial court dismissed the indictment. The State sought review of the trial court's order and the appellate court determined that the charges were properly dismissed because the State had violated Alaska R. Crim. P. 45, which provided that defendant had to be tried within a certain period of time. On further appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The State argued that Rule 45 was unconstitutional because it violated the doctrine of separation of powers. The court held that the additional protections conferred upon defendant by Rule 45 were justified because they were incidental to the efficient implementation of the constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court further held that Rule 45 furthered the &quot;social interest&quot; in ensuring that crimes were prosecuted expeditiously and was therefore within the rule-making authority of the judiciary. The court found that the appellate court did not consider the State's contention that the 94 of the 120 days provided for in Rule 45 had expired by the time defendant was indicted and therefore remanded the cause for an evaluation of the State's calculations.</SPAN></P>

The court found that jurisdiction over the trust was not necessary because the complaint alleged the husband's personal debt, not a debt owed by the trust. The court held that the superior court had subject matter jurisdiction and did not err by granting a dismissal for want of prosecution. The court found that there could have been reason to find that circumstances justified a modification of the husband's alimony obligation, but that the trial court did not make factual findings or articulate its reasoning with sufficient particularity to enable review of its holding.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to driving, defendant had consumed an alcoholic beverage, an antibiotic, and possibly, a prescription painkiller. Defendant asserted that Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.030(a)(3) was unconstitutionally vague in its use of the terms &quot;combined influence&quot; and &quot;another substance.&quot; On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that the term &quot;combined influence&quot; was not vague, as it was clear that whatever was combined with alcohol had to be a contributing factor in causing intoxication. Although the court of appeals deemed that &quot;substance&quot; was synonymous with &quot;drug,&quot; the court found that &quot;substance&quot; was a much broader term, and was unconstitutionally vague as it gave no notice as to what substances combined with alcohol were prohibited. While the State argued that &sect; 28.35.030(a)(3) was encompassed by &sect; 28.35.030(a)(1), the court held that such an argument would render &sect; 28.35.030(a)(3) superfluous, which would be against legislative intent. Because it could not be determined under which subsection defendant was convicted based on the jury instructions given, the court remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Disciplinary Board of the Alaska Bar Association (Board) suspended attorney from the practice of law for 18 months after the attorney allegedly &quot;created&quot; a document, a copy of which he later attached, as an exhibit, to an unverified complaint. On appeal, the court held that the Alaska Bar Rules clearly afforded the attorney an opportunity to be heard by the Board. Furthermore, since the attorney was on notice that the Board might depart from the Hearing Committee's findings and recommendations, whether or not there was an appeal, the attorney waived his right to be heard, by entering into the stipulation. The court could not conclude, as the attorney asked it to do, that his interest in practicing law and in his reputation was so much more substantial than the public's interest in a fairly and accurately functioning judicial system that it should adopt a standard of proof which put the risk of an incorrect factual determination on the public. The court rejected the attorney's position that proof by clear and convincing evidence was required as a matter of federal due process. The court concluded that the findings of the Board were supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1978 the Department assessed taxes under the Alaska Business License Act (ABLA) against the corporation and six of its subsidiaries for taxes on their gross receipts for the years 1971 through 1974. In May 1976 Alaska Stat. &sect; 43.05.260(a), established a three year statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes and was made retroactive to January 1, 1976. The corporation and it subsidiaries maintained that &sect; 43.05.260(a) applied retroactively to bar the assessments. The trial court held that &sect; 43.05.260(a) barred the assessments except as to three of the corporations. On appeal, the court held that: (1) section 43.05.260(a) was not applied retroactively and the three-year statute of limitations did not bar the assessments against the corporations and its subsidiaries; (2) the ABLA did not exempt affiliated corporations from the tax on gross receipts; (3) in the ABLA the term manufactured or processed did not include the cutting or sorting of logs; and (4) the commerce and import-export clauses of the federal constitution did not prohibit the Department's taxation of domestic international sales corporations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An injured person was operating a semi-trailer on the Dalton Highway in December. The Dalton Highway was closed to the public after September 1, and the semi-trailer was being operated by virtue of a permit under Alaska Stat. &sect; 42.10. Under &sect; 42.10, an injured person must indemnify and hold harmless the state for any incidents occurring on the highway. Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the injured person's complaint. On review, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment, but reversed as to attorneys fees. The court held: (1) the indemnification and hold harmless agreements were valid against the injured person, even though he did not sign the permit under Alaska Admin. Code tit. 17, &sect; 30.050; (2) whether deliberately or not, the injured person's employer purported to act as the injured person's agent when its dispatcher signed the permit, and the injured person was bound to the terms of the permit, including the hold harmless language; (4) the &quot;public duty&quot; exception did not apply to invalidate an otherwise valid law; and (5) the contract was not one of adhesion; and (5) the state was entitled to attorneys fees under the indemnity clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its ruling, the superior court held that the transferability provisions of the Limited Entry Act (Act), Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 16.43.010-16.43.380, violated Alaska Const. art. VIII, &sect; 15, prohibiting exclusive rights of fishery, and Alaska Const. art. I, &sect; 1, guaranteeing all persons equal rights and opportunities. Upon review the supreme court held that the Act did not violate those provisions of the Alaska Constitution, and reversed the judgment of the superior court granting post-conviction relief to defendants. Exclusion from participation as a gear license holder in a fishery was not more violative of the common use or the no exclusive right of fishery clauses because it was based on one's financial rather than physical standing, or on the laws of chance. Each of the objectives identified by the state as purposes of free transferability was discussed in the extensive legislative hearings preceding passage of the Act. Further, the objectives were legitimate and fairly and substantially furthered by free transferability. Therefore, the equal protection clause of the Alaska Constitution was not violated by the transfer provisions of the Act.</SPAN></P>

The Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, rejected the constitutional claims, but held that the by-laws violated &sect; 18.80.230.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The organization contended that the trial court erred in holding that the exclusion of women from full membership violated &sect; 18.80.230. The court agreed, and reversed that portion of the order, holding that Alaska Stat. &sect; 18.80.300(7) should not have been construed to encompass the organization. The court reasoned that the organization was not a &quot;public accommodation&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 18.80.300(7). The court said that &sect; 18.80.300(7) defined &quot;public accommodation&quot; in terms of a &quot;place.&quot; Accordingly, the court construed &sect; 18.80.300(7) as applying exclusively to places of public accommodation. The court said that because the organization was not a place, it did not fall within the prohibition of Alaska Stat. &sect; 18.80.230. On cross-appeal, the woman challenged the trial court's holding that the organization's membership policies did not violate the Alaska Constitution. The court agreed with the trial court, holding that the nexus between the state and the challenged action of the private organization was insufficient to satisfy the &quot;state action&quot; requirement. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court's order, which held that the membership policies were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The department was ordered not to prosecute the wage claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's grant of summary declaratory judgment, which dismissed the claim filed with the department, and enjoined the department from prosecuting the claim. The court held that the power to accept an assignment of and to investigate and prosecute a wage claim did not include the power to deal with a claim that an employer unconstitutionally, illegally, arbitrarily and capriciously failed to increase an employee's salary. Because the employee did not seek to recover wages due him, but rather claimed that he was wrongfully denied a reclassification and a salary increase, the court held that the department could not prosecute the employee's claim. The court held that because the jurisdiction of the department was questioned on persuasive grounds, an exception to the requirement that the university exhaust all of its administrative remedies existed. The court held that the burden on the university and the apparent doubt about the department's jurisdiction justified the superior court's grant of judicial relief without requiring further administrative proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An appeal involved two cases. In the first, appellant oil companies challenged a decision of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which denied their summary judgment motion in an action against appellees, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources and various state officials, concerning the validity of several regulations. The other case involved the same issue, but the opposite result in superior court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each appeal involved a challenge to the validity of 11 Alaska Admin. Code &sect;&sect; 96.210-96.240, regulations promulgated by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. The regulations required persons who wished to explore for oil or gas on state lands to obtain a miscellaneous land use permit from the department. In exchange for the permit, explorers were required to submit certain data and information to the department. Two separate actions by oil companies sought the invalidation of &sect;&sect; 96.210-96.240 and a permanent injunction against their enforcement. In one action, the court held the regulations valid, in the other, invalid. The oil companies appealed the first decision; the department appealed the second. On appeal, the court affirmed the first judgment and reversed the second. The court held that Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 38.05.020(b)(1) and 38.05.180, considered together, implied authority to adopt the challenged regulations. The court also held that the regulations were procedurally valid, since there was reasonable notice that the proposed regulations might affect the petroleum industry's interests in the area of submission of test data.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court decision that denied summary judgment for the oil companies and held the regulations valid. The court reversed the trial court decision that granted summary judgment for the oil companies and held the regulations invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician challenged the judgment from the Superior Court, State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which affirmed a finding of incompetence by respondents, medical board and division of licensing, pursuant to Alaska Admin. Code tit. 12, &sect; 40.970 (amended 1980, 1981). The superior court affirmed the revocation of the physician's license to practice medicine in accordance with Alaska Stat. &sect; 08.64.330(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician contended that Alaska Admin. Code tit. 12, &sect; 40.970 (amended 1980, 1981) was so ambiguous that it failed to give adequate notice of prohibited conduct. The court affirmed the judgment and found that the term &quot;professional incompetence&quot; was not so vague that a qualified practitioner would be deprived of fair notice of the minimum standard of competence required. The medical board was justified in meeting with the hearing officer pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 44.62.500(a) for two hours in a closed decision while the board considered the proposed decision. The physician argued that the hearing officer incorrectly applied the clear and convincing standard of proof in evaluating the evidence. The court concluded that the substantial evidence test was the correct standard to be used in the proceeding. However, the hearing officer filed almost thirty pages of detailed, accurate factual findings, and balanced, thoughtful conclusions, which were more than adequate to survive the substantial evidence test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment by the medical board and licensing division that revoked the physician's medical license. The court held that the record showed the proceedings to be thorough, comprehensive, and fair. The findings and conclusions were supported by substantial evidence, and the decision clearly had a reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lowest bidder sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which found for appellees, a second-lowest bidder and a third-lowest bidder, in their suit challenging a notice of intent by appellee Alaska Power Authority (APA) to award a contract to the lowest bidder. The third-lowest bidder cross-appealed the award of the contract to the second-lowest bidder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The APA issued a notice of intent to award a contract for a construction project to the lowest bidder. The second-lowest bidder and the third-lowest bidder challenged the intended award. They contended that the lowest bidder did not qualify as an Alaska bidder under the Alaska bidder preference statute,&nbsp;Alaska Stat. &sect; 37.05.230, because it was a joint venture that did not have an Alaska business license and did not maintain a place of business in Alaska for six months preceding its bid. They also argued that one of the lowest bidder's venturers would not qualify individually as an Alaska bidder. The superior court held that the lowest bidder was a nonresident bidder. On appeal, the court reversed. The court agreed with the APA's interpretation of &sect; 37.05.230(5) as permitting a joint venture to qualify for preference if any of the venturers would qualify individually as an Alaska bidder. The court exercised its independent judgment and gave weight to the fact that the APA had consistently granted preference to joint ventures when one of the venturers qualified individually as an Alaska bidder. The lowest bidder qualified as an Alaska bidder where one of its venturers so qualified.</SPAN></P>
