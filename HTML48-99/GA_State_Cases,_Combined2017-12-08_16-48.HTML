<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insured challenged a judgment from the Court of Appeals of Georgia, which found in favor of appellee uninsured driver and held that an automobile insurance policy provision excluding liability coverage while an insured was &quot;attempting to avoid apprehension or arrest&quot; was unenforceable under the Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations (&quot;no-fault&quot;) Act (MVAR), Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 33-34-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted certiorari to decide whether an exclusion in the insurer's automobile insurance policy, which excluded liability coverage while an insured was &quot;attempting to avoid apprehension or arrest,&quot; was unenforceable as a matter of public policy in view of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 33-34-1. The court held that the exclusion was directly contrary to the public interest of accident victims to have access to insurance funds to satisfy their judgments and that the MVAR was enacted to serve that very interest. The court held that unless a passenger in a fleeing vehicle could demonstrate to the trier of fact by a preponderance of the evidence that he did not encourage or participate in the attempt to avoid apprehension or arrest, the exclusion was enforceable as to the passenger.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the exclusion was unenforceable on the ground of public policy as to the deceased who was merely driving when another driver who was fleeing the police struck him. However the court held that the exclusion was unenforceable only to the extent of insurance required by the MVAR. The public policy would not protect passengers who were willing participants in the fleeing vehicle.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for aggravated assault by the Bibb Superior Court (Georgia). Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-5-21(a)(2), which provided a person commits the offense of aggravated assault when he assaults with a deadly weapon or with any object, device, or instrument which, when used offensively against a person, is likely to or actually does result in serious bodily injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of aggravated assault after he struck a friend in the face during a fight at a party. Defendant challenged his conviction on two grounds. First, he should have been charged only with simple battery, under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-5-23. And second, &sect; 16-5-21(a)(2), the aggravated assault statute, was unconstitutionally vague because, (1) the term &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; was defectively vague, and (2) the statute was defectively vague because no one could have reasonably expected the consequences which occurred. On appeal, the court noted that the trial court charged the jury as to simple battery, but that the jury found defendant guilty of aggravated assault. As to defendant's contention that &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; was unconstitutionally vague, the court found that no one of common intelligence could fail to classify an injury that necessitated neurosurgery as a &quot;serious bodily injury.&quot; Finally, the position that no one could have foreseen the consequences of the defendant's actions was similarly untenable. The court therefore held that defendant's contentions were without merit and affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court which had convicted the defendant of aggravated assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband challenged a decision from the Walker Superior Court (Georgia), which denied his motion to dismiss appellee wife's complaint for divorce for lack of jurisdiction, and provided for property rights, temporary alimony, insurance benefits, and mutual restraining orders. The husband argued that the Georgia &quot;long arm&quot; statute was unconstitutional, and that the summons and process were insufficient because it bore an incorrect caption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife alleged that the husband was a resident of Georgia, temporarily residing in Tennessee. The husband was served personally within Georgia. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's denial of the husband's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The court found that the husband had failed to raise the constitutional issue in the trial court, and the court was not obligated to pass on the issue for the first time on appeal. However, the court noted that the evidence showed, regardless of the husband's residency status, that he was personally served while within the State of Georgia, and Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 50-2-21, which provided for personal jurisdiction based solely upon service of process within the forum, was constitutional. The court also held that even though the summons and process bore an incorrect caption, the service of process was sufficient because the error in no way operated to prejudice the husband or deprive him of notice. He correctly filed his answer and motion to dismiss in the correct court. The court held that where actual notice of the action was received, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-11-4(d)(7) was to be liberally construed to effectuate service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The telephone company filed an application with the commission for a rate increase. The commission conducted evidentiary hearings and granted a lesser increase than requested. The telephone company filed a petition for review with the trial court under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 50-13-19. The trial court granted the telephone company's motion for an interlocutory injunction pending trial that allowed the telephone company to collect the rate it requested until after the judicial proceedings were resolved. The court held that under the APA, the trial court could not take additional evidence on issues of fact, and had to uphold the commission's findings if there was any evidence to support them. The court concluded that the trial court had no authority to issue the injunction under the APA because the issuance of an interlocutory injunction involved hearing evidence and acting as a trier of fact. Further, the APA provided an adequate remedy for the telephone company and did not require the intervention of equity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia) affirmed appellee zoning board's (board) decision, which ruled that appellant business owner's (owner) sign, as defined as the entire structure, was within 300 feet of a historic-property boundary line in violation of the valid ordinance and must be removed. The owner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner was issued a sign permit to erect a billboard. The owner renewed its permit. He received a permit for a larger, two-faced billboard after an inspection by a city inspector. The billboard was within 300 feet of a historic property listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in apparent violation of &sect; 16-28.019(13) of the city ordinance. The owner ignored the notices of violation, completed the advertisement on the billboard. The court stated that the provision in the ordinance set forth clearly and unambiguously that such prohibited distance was to be measured from any point on the &quot;boundaries&quot; of the historic site to any &quot;part of the general advertising sign&quot; which &quot;was visible therefrom.&quot; This put the world on notice that, within a 300-foot zone perimeter surrounding a historic site, no general advertising sign was permitted if visible from the historic-site boundaries. Thus, the trial court did not err in holding that no state or federal equal-protection or due-process rights of the owner were violated and that the ordinance in question was not overly broad or overly restrictive, and was reasonable, clear and unambiguous.</SPAN></P>

After the mother and father divorced, the trial court ordered joinder of the father under the amendments to &sect; 105-1307, 1979 Ga. Laws 446, 493, 494, 497, and 1980 Ga. Laws 1154. On appeal, the court held that the mother was not entitled to reversal of the judgment even if joinder of the father was improper. The court reasoned that the evidence at trial would have been the same whether or not the father was joined as a party plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment that was against the mother and in favor of the hospital and doctors in the mother's action to recover for the death of her child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of failing to pay state income taxes and failing to timely file a state income tax return. He demurred to the accusations on the ground that the Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-7-2 violated Ga. Const. Art. I, &sect; I, para. XXIII, which prohibited imprisonment for debt. The trial court sustained the demurrers and on the state's appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that an income tax was a debt, and therefore Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-7-2(a)(1), which allowed for imprisonment for failure to pay income taxes, was unconstitutional as a violation of the Georgia Constitution. The trial court should not have sustained the demurrer to the accusation for failure to timely make an income tax return on constitutional grounds, because there was no constitutional inhibition against criminalizing the failure to make the return. However, the accusation charged defendant with failure to make a timely return, whereas the statute merely made it unlawful to fail to make a return. Thus, the court could not say that the trial court erred in sustaining a demurrer based on that variance.</SPAN></P>

The issues in the case involved the rights of the uncle's illegitimate child to the estate of the uncle and to the estate of the deceased. A side issue was the implication by the trial court that the husband of the intestate aunt may have inherited from the deceased niece. The probate court denied the claim of the uncle's illegitimate child because there had been no adjudication of paternity prior to the uncle's death. The probate court made a determination of the heirs of the aunt and the uncle and the spouses of those persons were held to be their respective heirs at law. On review, the court held that the uncle's illegitimate child could not inherit from her father because there had been no adjudication of paternity prior to his death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A six year old child sustained injuries in a near drowning that occurred in a swimming pool owned and operated by the municipality. The next friend of the child filed a personal injury action against the municipality and alleged negligence and nuisance. The municipality filed a motion for summary judgment, and the trial court granted the municipality's motion. The next friend appealed, and the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the evidence established that the operation of the swimming pool was primarily for public benefit rather than for producing revenue. Thus, it was a governmental function, and the municipality was shielded from liability by the doctrine of governmental immunity. Further, sovereign immunity was not a deprivation of property without just compensation, nor a denial of equal protection or due process.

It found that voir dire testimony of two jurors defendant claimed were improperly excused reflected that neither could vote for the death penalty no matter what the evidence. Further, the third statement was not improperly admitted as at no time during police interrogation did defendant express any desire to deal with police only through counsel or request that interrogation cease for any reason. Further, his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not yet attached as the initial hearing when there was no prosecutor present and the only issue resolved was to set a date for such a confrontation.

Although defendant was a juvenile, the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction over the theft by taking count because its concurrent jurisdiction over capital felonies committed by juveniles extended to related lesser crimes that were part of the same criminal transaction. The court also rejected defendant's claim that, because the jury verdict must be construed as finding him guilty of felony murder, the verdict on theft by taking must be vacated. The court found that the jury was instructed that any verdict other than malice murder should be specified and that the jury found defendant guilty of malice murder. Thus, the court held that there was no merit in the claim that the theft by taking count should be vacated or that the verdict of felony murder was invalid. The court also affirmed the introduction of defendant's custodial statement. The court found that there was a knowing and intelligent waiver of defendant's rights.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, as the evidence was sufficient to convince a rational trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed the crimes and supported a finding that the crimes involved the offense of aggravated battery. The court concluded that the voir dire was not overly restrictive, that the trial court did not err by concluding that none of the prospective jurors were disqualified or in denying the motion to change venue, and that probable cause existed for the arrest warrant. The court found that the temporal distance between defendant's illegal detention and his confession and the intervening circumstance of a lawful arrest sufficiently &quot;attenuated&quot; any &quot;taint&quot; and allowed the admission of defendant's post-arrest statements over a Fourth Amendment objection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court did refuse to enjoin the private clubs from selling alcoholic beverages. Appellants asserted on appeal that the trial court erred in finding &sect; 3-7-43&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the general laws of the State of Georgia provided that local governing authorities and the state revenue commissioner could have only issued licenses to private clubs authorizing the sale of alcoholic beverages after a local election approving that activity has been held and that in contrast, &sect; 3-7-43 permitted the governing authority of any county having a population between 36,800 and 36,990 to issue, without approval by the voters, alcoholic beverage licenses to private clubs. The court held that there was no rational relationship between the population bracket established &sect; 3-7-43 and the right to vote on whether a local governing authority can issue alcoholic beverage licenses to private clubs. Thus, the trial court correctly held &sect; 3-7-43 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Six days later, the second propounder filed a petition to probate the second will in solemn form and gave notice to the heirs pursuant to &sect; 53-3-13. The probate court ordered the second will probated. The first propounder filed a motion in the probate court to set aside the order probating the second will on the ground that she was not given notice. On review, the court found that the first propounder had a protected interest as a legatee of a will previously filed for probate. She was given no notice of the second propounder's petition, although there was evidence that the second propounder was aware of the prior proceedings and knew that her interest could have been affected adversely by probate of the second will.

The first format did not violate gambling laws. In the second format, guests paid for chips and play money, and in the third format, a donation was required to receive play money.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Court of Appeals of Georgia certified a question to the court. The case involved a claim for optional personal injury protection (PIP) benefits under a policy issued to plaintiff insured by defendant insurer. After the insurer rejected his claim, the insured filed suit. After the trial court granted the insurer's motion for summary judgment, the insured appealed to the appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The policy was issued in October, 1982. The insured was not given the opportunity required by O.C.G.A. &sect; 33-34-5 to accept or reject PIP benefits. The insured was involved in an accident in 1983. The appellate court's certified question as whether the insured, whose application for insurance did not meet the requirements of &sect; 33-34-5(b) in effect prior to November 1, 1982 was thereafter barred by &sect; 33-34-5(c), which became effective November 1, 1982, from the right to demand and receive the benefit of the PIP coverage upon tender of the additional premium and filing of proof of loss. The court held that the insured's claim was barred by the amendment, which provided that all named insureds in motor vehicle liability policies in effect on November 1, 1982, were deemed to have signed the statement required by &sect; 33-34-5(b). The court noted that if the claim had stemmed from an accident that occurred before the effective date of the amendment, it would not have been barred because the amendment could not be applied retroactively. The insured had no vested contractual right to the PIP coverage. The signature requirement of &sect; 33-34-5(b) did not create a vested right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before the trial court, the gas company asserted that the franchise tax was an unconstitutional impairment of its original franchise contract with the town, and that the town lacked the authority to impose a later occupational tax. The trial court upheld both taxes. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that when the original franchise was granted to the gas company in 1940 it was not granted in perpetuity and, thus, was revocable after a reasonable period of time. The court noted that the franchise agreement did not state that it was in perpetuity, and that could not be implied, and that further the town was barred by the state constitution from entering into such a perpetual contract. The court found the tax not to be an unconstitutional impairment of the franchise. The court held that the imposition of the occupational tax was within the authority vested in the town when it was incorporated under Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 683-710 (1895).</SPAN></P>

The victim's unborn child died as a result and defendants were charged and convicted of feticide. Defendants alleged the feticide statute was unconstitutionally vague and violated their due process rights. Defendants argued that the use of the work &quot;quick&quot; as a description of that time during pregnancy after which the killing of the unborn child in a certain manner violated the statute, was so uncertain and inexact a term as to make enforcement of the statute arbitrary. The court affirmed defendants' convictions and held that the distinction between a woman being pregnant and a woman being &quot;quick&quot; with child was well known and recognized within the law. The court held that a child who was &quot;quick&quot; was developed enough to be able to move within the mother's womb. The court held that this was a commonly understood word among ordinary people. The court noted that an explanation of the word was provided in the trial court's charge to the jury. The victim testified that she was 16 weeks pregnant at the time of the shooting and had felt her child move.</SPAN></P>

The surviving children claimed that the statute denied them equal protection under the state and federal constitutions. On appeal, the court held that the statute unconstitutionally denied equal protection because it allowed the children of a deceased mother to sue for her wrongful death, even if she was survived by a husband, but denied the same right to children of a father survived by a widow.</SPAN></P>

Section 9-3-51(a) barred personal injury actions arising from an improvement to real property more than eight year after substantial completion of the improvement. The worker argued that &sect; 9-3-51(a) denied him access to the courts. The court examined the statute under Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. IV (1945) (in operation when the law went into effect) and Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. XII (1983), in effect at the time of the worker's challenge. Both provisions provided that the state not deprive a person of the right to prosecute his own claim in the state courts. The court held that the state constitutional provisions only established a person's right of self-representation. Those provisions did not establish a right of access to the state courts that, as proposed by the worker, barred the state legislature from abolishing existing common law or statutory rights of action for personal injuries caused by negligence.</SPAN></P>

A jury convicted all three of dogfighting and gambling and convicted the first and third defendants of commercial gambling. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court found that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-12-37 did not make unlawful allowing a dogfight to occur, but prohibited one from causing or allowing a dog to fight another dog for sport or gaming purposes. Thus, the court held that &sect; 16-12-37 was sufficiently definite to put those of common intelligence on notice that knowing participation in a dogfighting event was prohibited. The court rejected defendants' argument that &sect; 16-12-37 violated equal protection. The court also held as a matter of law that a $ 5,000 fine with an optional one year in prison did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment for those convicted of dogfighting. Lastly, the court ruled that the facts that defendants had money on them when they were arrested and the officers heard someone say &quot;I'll take five on that&quot; was sufficient for a jury to conclude that the purpose of the event was a gaming purpose.</SPAN></P>

The court held that as a matter of law a $ 5,000 fine with an optional one year in prison for dogfighting was not cruel and unusual punishment. The statute was not invalid on equal protection grounds for punishing dogfighting as a felony while cockfighting was only a misdemeanor because the legislature acted within its discretion in mandating that those who participated in a dogfight organized for gaming purposes should be dealt with more harshly. The court also held the circumstantial evidence, together with the equipment found at the scene, the time and place of the event, and the evidence as to the nature of dogfighting were sufficient evidence of gambling, and that dogfighting was not as a matter of law a lesser included offense of commercial gambling.</SPAN></P>

The DMA ruled that because the owners or their spouses were legislators in the Georgia Assembly, their ownership interest conflicted with the Code of Ethics for Government Service, Ga.

Each owner appealed to a separate superior court that ruled that the ownership interests did not conflict with the Code, and the DMA appealed the superior court decisions. The court affirmed the decisions of the superior court. The court held that the owners were not in violation of the Code because the owners did not sell or lease any personal or real property or services to the DMA. The owners only provided services or products to their patients and were in turn reimbursed by the DMA. The court held that the reimbursement scheme did not offend any provision of the code because it did not come within the defined conduct of &quot;transacting any business&quot; as defined by Ga.

Ruling that &sect; 42-9-46, as well as Ga.

Contending that he was indigent, the putative father requested that the costs of the tests be initially taxed to the state. After a hearing, the trial court ordered the blood testing. Although it found the putative father to be indigent, the trial court denied his request to require the state to make pre-trial payment of the testing costs. On appeal, the court reversed finding that the trial court's denial left the putative father with the responsibility of paying for the tests, and, because of his indigency, effectively denied him access to blood test evidence that would help to insure the accuracy of the paternity decision.

Defendant was arrested and charged with shooting over baited land in violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that &sect; 27-3-9(b) violated due process because it was vague and failed to give fair notice of the proscribed activity. The indictment alleged that defendant unlawfully hunted doves near a field where feed and baiting material had been scattered to lure the doves. The court upheld the judgment against defendant and determined that &sect; 27-3-9(b) was constitutional. All that the Due Process Clause required was that the law gave sufficient warning that men may have conducted themselves to avoid the forbidden act. Section 27-3-9(a) was aimed at the person who actually engaged in the act of baiting the land by placing any type feed to lure game birds for hunting. Section &sect; 27-3-9(b) focused on the hunter who took advantage of the baited area. The section was part of the state's overall regulatory and licensing system relating to fish and game. When &sect; 27-3-9 was read as a whole, the language gave sufficient notice of the acts so as to comply with the requirements of due process. The prohibition was that hunters were not to place themselves in an area to take advantage of bait that was set out in violation of &sect; 27-3-9(a).</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment affirming the Commission's decisions. The court determined that &sect; 46-2-26.3 was not unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 46-2-26.3 did not violate equal protection because present and future classes of customers were not discrete classes for purposes of equal protection analysis since they were constantly fluctuating groups. In addition, there was a rational basis for the disparate treatment of the two groups since it was reasonable to charge a higher price to industrial customers. The court held &sect; 46-2-26.3 was special legislation. The constitution did not prohibit special laws, as long as the legislature had not previously legislated in that area by general law and the classification was not unreasonable. The court held that the special law was not prohibited because &sect; 46-2-23 granted the Commission the authority to regulate public utilities, but did not divest the General Assembly of its constitutional power to regulate public utilities.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judges brought a declaratory judgment action challenging the prohibitions on the practice of law in two retirement funds, the Superior Court Judges (Emeritus) Retirement Fund of Georgia (1945 Act) or the Superior Court Judges Retirement System (1976 Act). The court affirmed the superior court's grant of summary judgment for the judges, holding that the 1945 Act now prohibited only the practice of law in the federal courts. Assuming without deciding that the general assembly was authorize to regulate the practice of law in the federal courts as part of its authority over retired state officers, no reason for doing so appeared. Thus, the prohibition violated the state constitution's due process clause, Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para. I (1983). The 1976 Act similarly violated the state due process clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former employee developed a lung disorder as a result of exposure to cotton dust that led to his terminating his employment on April 2, 1976. The former employee's condition was first diagnosed as byssinosis in 1982 and he filed a claim for benefits under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 34-9-281(d) that was adopted in 1982 and extended the time to file claims based on byssinosis to July 1, 1984. The administrative law judge ruled that the claim was not barred by the one-year limitations period in effect in 1976 and awarded benefits to the former employee. The superior court affirmed the award. On appeal, the former employer argued that &sect; 34-9-281(d) was a retroactive law and unconstitutional under Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I. The court affirmed and determined that the former employer did not have a vested defense in the one-year limitation period.  Overruling Bussey v. Bishop, 169 Ga. 251 (1929), the court held that the legislature could revive a workers' compensation claim which would have been barred by a previous limitation period by enacting a new statute of limitation without violating the constitutional prohibition against retroactive law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A state solicitor ordered seizure, pursuant to a warrant, of film projectors allegedly used to show obscene movies. The film operators brought an action against the state solicitor. During the action, the film operators brought an interlocutory appeal, claiming violation of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights and similar provisions of the state constitution. The lower court found in favor of the state solicitor, and the film operators sought review. On review, the court found that the seizure of the projectors implicated the First Amendment rights of the film operators because the seizure cut off the film operators' right of expression. The court found that under the circumstances an adversarial hearing to determine the obscenity issue was mandated before the search could be ruled permissible. The court found that such a hearing had been conducted at the request of the film operators but did not find anything in the record to indicate what the parties presented or the lower court determined at the hearing.

Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 9-3-71 provided for a two-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice, running from the negligent act.

Defendant moved for judgment on the pleadings, which the trial court denied, holding the statute unconstitutional and the court agreed. While there was a rational basis for separating medical malpractice claims from general tort claims, the three-way classification created by the statute was arbitrary and not substantially related to the goals of statutes of limitation.

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 43-21-5, 43-21-6. The trial court ruled that the code sections in question were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While staying at the corporation's hotel, the lodgers incurred a large telephone bill, which they refused to pay. As a result, the hotel barred the lodgers from their room and retained their personal belongings. The lodgers then paid the bill, regained their things, and brought an action seeking compensatory and punitive damages for trespass. The hotel sought summary judgment on the ground that its self-help was authorized by &sect;&sect; 43-21-5, 43-21-6, which provided for innkeepers' liens and their enforcement. The trial court granted the motion, ruling that those sections were not unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the hotel was not a state actor for the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found that the lodgers' contention that, even though hotel effected the actual seizure of their property without overt assistance from the state, the state's statutory authorization of that conduct, coupled with judicial ratification, transformed the seizure into state action, had already been rejected by the United States Supreme Court. The court found that the sole action attributable to the state was the enactment of the innkeepers' lien statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 16-11-64, the district attorney applied for several warrants for wire tap surveillance, which included tapping numerous telephones located in judicial circuits other than the circuit in which the issuing judge had jurisdiction. The &quot;listening post&quot; where the intercepted conversations were heard and recorded was located in the jurisdiction in which the warrants were issued. Defendants were convicted of racketeering, based upon the predicate offense of gambling, through the use of evidence obtained by the wire taps. On appeal, defendants contended the issuing judge exceeded his authority because pieces of the equipment essential to the interception of their conversations, specifically inductor coils, were located outside of the jurisdiction, as well as several of the telephones tapped. The court held that the inductor coils were only used to prevent detection and did not fall within the purview of &sect; 16-11-64 and its jurisdictional requirements. Because the listening post and the actual criminal activity were located in the issuing judge's jurisdiction, the warrants were proper and the evidence obtained through the wire taps was admissible.</SPAN></P>

Evidence was admitted at trial that he previously committed similar crimes. The trial court convicted him of murder, rape, aggravated sodomy, and false imprisonment and sentenced him to death. The court affirmed. Defendant's other crimes were properly admitted because they were relevant to prove identity, which was an issue at trial. The jury instructions for use of the other crimes evidence were proper even though identity and modus operandi were not mentioned because those reasons were the most compelling for admission of the evidence. The jury instruction that the jury was authorized to impose either the death penalty or life imprisonment for murder was incomplete because it did not inform the jury that it was authorized to impose the death penalty only if it found at least one statutory aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the court considered all the jury instructions and held that the jury was informed that it had to find an aggravating circumstance to impose the death penalty and that it could have refused to impose the death penalty even if it found an aggravating circumstance.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that &sect; 26-2616 provide defendant an opportunity to explain at the trial why he was in the garage and if the jury excepted his explanation as being reasonable and satisfactory then the jury was entitled to acquit defendant of the charges, which was not a violation of due process or defendant's right to not incriminate himself.</SPAN></P>

The subdivision residents filed an action to set aside the rezoning and enjoin the development under the rezoned classification. The residents claimed that the rezoning was unconstitutionally arbitrary and unreasonable, was a manifest abuse of the rezoning power based on voting that was the product of fraud and corruption, and violated &sect; 1983. The residents appealed the dismissal of the action against the developer. The court reversed, in part, because the trial court applied too stringent a burden in finding that evidence that the developer was a customer of the commissioners did not constitute clear and convincing evidence of fraud or corruption. The court remanded for reconsideration of the fraud and corruption issue in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence standard and for consideration of the civil rights action, over which the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction. The court affirmed the finding that the residents failed to prove that the commercial use of the lots required more water than residential use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants contended that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because &sect; 3-3-23(d) permitted 18-year-old members of the military to purchase and consume alcohol while &sect; 3-3-23(a)(1) prohibited any person from furnishing alcoholic beverages to any person under 19 years of age. Upon review, the court found that the clear intent of the statute was to preclude individuals from furnishing alcoholic beverages to persons less than 19 years of age unless that person was an active member of the military or met the remaining exceptions in the statute. The statute was not void for vagueness because it informed people of what the State commanded or forbid and was drawn so that men of common intelligence did not have to guess at its meaning. The court concluded that &sect; 3-3-23 did not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it treated 18 year-old members of the military differently than other 18 year-olds. There was a rational distinction between the two classes because the 18 year-old members of the military stood out from the general population in their training, discipline, and accountability to authority.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction and claimed that the statute was unconstitutional because it deprived him of his own property without due process of law. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim that the fish in question were domesticated and not game fish. Under O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-1-2 (36)(C), the fish that defendant sold were included in the definition of game fish. The court found that the statute under which defendant was convicted did not prohibit defendant's right to take the fish from his own pond, it only prohibited the purchase or sale of the fish. The court concluded that when the state in its sovereign capacity exercised its inherent power to regulate and preserve wildlife, there was no taking from an individual or infringement of his constitutional rights. Defendant's property right in the ownership of the fish was not absolute and unqualified and would have to yield to the state's power to regulate and preserve for the public good.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of child abandonment under O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-10-1. Defendant was found not guilty of the offense but sought review of the judgment because it did not dispose of the issue of his alleged paternity of the child, which he denied. Defendant claimed that the lower court erred in denying his motion for funds to pay for a blood test, as he was indigent, and in proceeding to trial without that evidence. On review, the court found that defendant's claim that the issue of paternity has been concluded against him and that he would be unable to deny it should he be charged again at some later time with abandonment was a question reviewable on appeal. The court agreed that the lower court erred in denying defendant's motion for funds for a blood test. The court noted that O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-10-1(f)(2) had been held unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court found the error alleged by defendant to be harmful because a verdict that defendant was not the father of the child would bar subsequent criminal and civil proceedings in that matter under O.C.G.A. &sect; 19-10-1(i).</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court erred in excluding evidence regarding the victim's state of mind prior to the alleged rape. The victim had stated to a friend that she &quot;wanted to go to a party and get some nooky,&quot; shortly before the alleged rape occurred. The court found that the victim's statement should have been admitted into evidence, and was thus, not inadmissible under the rape shield statute. The court concluded that the trial court's error in excluding the victim's statement was not harmless, and therefore, the convictions were reversed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, transportation department and its director, appealed a judgment from the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia), which found certain exemptions in the highway weight regulations under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 32-6-26(b) to be unconstitutional and enjoined their enforcement. Plaintiffs, a mining association and trucking companies, cross-appealed the trial court's holding that the department was not subject to the Georgia Administrative Procedure Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the department argued that it was error to declare the exemptions to be violative of equal protection guarantees and that if the exemptions created constitutionally invalid classifications of exemptions, the appropriate remedy would have been to strike all of the exempted categories. In their cross-appeals, the association and company contended that the trial court erred in denying them injunctive relief. Upon review, the court reversed the judgment, holding the weight limits unconstitutional and affirming the remainder of the decision. The allowance of the limited exemptions for certain industries which were vital to the economy of the state and who, due to the nature of their loads, could not avail themselves of other statutory exceptions was not wholly arbitrary. The association and company failed to prove that the statutory scheme violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 91A-3301, later Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-6-90, was not rendered unconstitutional by the fact that it provided for taxation of bank shares based on the net worth of the bank without subtracting the value of federal securities owned by the bank.</SPAN></P>

The U.S. Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case to the court for further consideration. On reconsideration, the court again affirmed. The court held that the Act commanded only that the state exclude federal obligations from net worth to the extent that they were represented therein. The court stated that the nature of a balance sheet was such that so much of the bank's assets that consisted of federal obligations were represented by an equivalent amount of liabilities, which resulted in those assets not being taxed, and net worth, which resulted in those assets being taxed, and therefore the proportionate deduction method afforded deduction of federal obligations to the full extent they were represented in net worth.</SPAN></P>

Also, the Act was not improperly applied retroactively because it replaced a prior act, and the signs were in violation of Ga. L. 1967, p. 423 et seq.

The trial court directed a verdict that the administrators were entitled to $ 90,000 optional benefits as a matter of law, and a jury returned a verdict that included a statutory penalty, attorney fees, and punitive damages. The court affirmed the directed verdict and remanded the case for the trial court to determine whether the insurer satisfied the time requirements of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 33-34-6(b), (c). The court held that the classification of no-fault insurance separate from other insurance was not a violation of equal protection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was tried twice and his conviction was reversed twice. The trial court convicted defendant for the third time. In addition to other enumerations of error, defendant contended that the voluntary manslaughter statute was unconstitutionally vague, that the evidence was not sufficient to support the conviction, and that he was denied his right to speedy trial. An alternate juror remained in the deliberating room for about 40 minutes before being removed. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court stated that the words of the voluntary manslaughter statute were capable of common understanding, therefore, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The court determined that a rational trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime charged. The court noted that defendant was not denied his right to speedy trial because continuances were requested and granted to both parties. The court found that there was no reversible error in mistakenly allowing the alternate juror to remain in the room during deliberations because the jury stated that the alternate juror's presence had no effect on their decision.</SPAN></P>

The city council denied his request for continuation of his license and for renewal of it.

The business owner argued that as there was no transcript of the mandamus hearing the appeal had to be affirmed. The court disagreed with the business owner's logic. The court determined that the license held by the business owner at the time of the fire was issued subject to the conditions and requirements of the amendment imposing the 30-day time requirement. The court concluded that the business owner was not denied due process. The business owner contended that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-2-3(1) provided a state license could not be cancelled without a notice and hearing and that the city's ordinance did not allow for notice and hearing.

The court then held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague due to its approval of attendance at &quot;private schools&quot; without defining that term. The court found that neither &sect; 20-2-690 nor any administrative rules or regulations defined the phrase &quot;private school&quot; or prescribed criteria which an entity was required meet to qualify as a &quot;private school.&quot; The court found that the statute was not sufficiently definite to provide a person of ordinary intelligence, who sought to avoid its penalties, fair notice of what constituted a &quot;private school.&quot; The court further held that the statute violated due process in that it impermissibly delegated to local law enforcement officials, judges, and juries the authority to determine what constituted a &quot;private school&quot; but failed to establish minimum guidelines for the exercise of that judgment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 51-4-2, as interpreted by the Georgia Supreme Court, to be unconstitutional in excluding illegitimate children from pursuing actions for the wrongful deaths of their fathers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The daughter was born in Florida where her father acknowledged her in writing and was named on her birth certificate. When the father was killed in an auto accident, she filed a wrongful death action against the other driver. The driver filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the illegitimate daughter could not maintain an action for her father's death. The trial court held that the law was unconstitutional. On the driver's interlocutory appeal, the court affirmed, noting that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 51-4-2 did not, on its face, discriminate against illegitimate children. The court overruled its 1949 case that imposed this interpretation on the statute. The court found that illegitimacy was an immutable human attribute that could not form the basis of discrimination under the equal protection clause and that it was unjust to penalize the daughter for her father's actions. The court concluded that, although the trial court held the statute unconstitutional, it was the court's interpretation that was flawed, overruled the case, and held that, if there was no widow, a child or children, whether legitimate or illegitimate, could recover for the wrongful death of a father.</SPAN></P>

On appeal to the superior court, the petition was granted and the woman was ordered to be sterilized. The woman challenged the order, contending that &sect; 31-20-3 was overly broad, lacked adequate guidelines and safeguards, and violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution by invading her right to privacy and depriving her of the right to have children. On review, the court reversed the order and declared the statute as unconstitutional. The court held that involuntary sterilization was akin to the termination of parental rights. Accordingly, the seriousness of an individual's interest at stake in a state initiated sterilization proceeding was such that due process required clear and convincing evidence to authorize the sterilization of an individual. The standard of a legal preponderance set forth in &sect; 31-20-3 did not meet the constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>

The city declared the bond to be forfeited, and pursuant to City of Macon, Ga., Code of Ordinances &sect; 4-1009(6), the bond company was called upon to pay the fine. It filed an action for declaratory judgment, alleging that the city ordinance was unconstitutional in that it was repugnant to Ga.

The court reversed the summary judgment granted to appellees. The court found that the DDAL's apparently broad scope was significantly limited by the narrower breadth of Ga. Const. art. IX. &sect; VI, para. III, the constitutional provision under which the court concluded that the DDAL was enacted. Appellees' project did not fall within the purview of the DDAL because it was not within the meaning of &quot;trade,&quot; &quot;commerce,&quot; or &quot;industry,&quot; the permissible projects enumerated in art. IX, &sect; VI, para. III. Although the project might have provided indirect employment opportunities in the course of its construction and operation and within the businesses it was designed to lure into the city, the general term &quot;employment opportunities&quot; in art. IX, &sect; VI, para. III meant opportunities which were the result of trade, commerce, and industry directly financed by a development authority.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers cross-appealed the denial of summary judgment on their affidavit of illegality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers disputed liability for bank share taxes when the bank became insolvent. The trial court charged the jury that the bank was not the agent of a shareholder for tax purposes. The court affirmed the judgment in part, reversed it in part, and remanded the case. The charge was harmful error because the bank was the taxpayers' agent for bank share tax purposes for the year at issue. Because there was evidence that the taxing authorities did make a timely unsuccessful attempt to recover the funds from the receiver, admitting evidence regarding the reserve account that the bank established for payment of the bank share tax was error.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 48-6-90 did not retroactively impose a tax on property held by the bank before the statute was enacted in violation of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, par. VII because taxes enacted in a calendar year were not unconstitutionally retroactive if they related back so as to tax for the entire year. Because the bank share tax taxed shareholders, the taxpayers could not evade ultimate liability for payment when the bank became insolvent.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was sufficient evidence to warrant conviction on each of the murder charges. There was no error in the &sect; 24-9-85(b) charge because the charge as a whole covered the principle urged. There was also no error in the introduction of evidence from a witnesses mother that defendant had threatened her daughter because it was properly admitted to show motive and state of mind. Furthermore, there was no right of confrontation issue because each of the witnesses was present and subject to full cross-examination. There was no merit to the severance issue because there was no trial objection and the counts were tried by consent.

Examining the death penalty imposed, the court concluded that the sentence was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering the crime and defendant. The court further held that the sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors. The court rejected defendant's contention that the prosecutor's remarks required reversal of the death sentence. The court concluded that while the remarks were improper, they were not so prejudicial or offensive and did not involve such egregious misconduct on the part of the prosecutor as to require reversal of the death sentence on the basis that it was impermissibly influenced by passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers filed an action challenging local tax assessments, and the trial court granted the officials' summary judgment motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. The General Assembly had authority to enact O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-5-271, requiring the Georgia State Revenue Commissioner to &quot;adjust and equalize&quot; assessments among the counties. The General Assembly's power to require uniformity of taxation between counties was inherent and was not prohibited by the state or federal Constitution. The delegation of such power to the Revenue Commissioner was therefore not unconstitutional. The local option sales tax act was enacted for the benefit of counties and cities, not school boards, which were separate and distinct governmental bodies with a separate source of revenue. There was no constitutional requirement that local option sales tax revenues be used for educational purposes. O.C.G.A. &sect; 48-5-7(a), setting the assessed value at 40 percent of fair market value, was not in conflict with the Georgia Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion. The father appealed. The appellate court found that the mother had waived her right to file an action against the father for child support, but that the contract to waive the son's right to support was unenforceable as contrary to public policy.

Where the omitted evidence was not specifically requested, nondisclosure was error only if it created a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist, and here, it did not. The court held that upon this record, the Georgia death penalty statute was not being administered arbitrarily or discriminatorily and rejected that claim that a trial court could not under any circumstances constitutionally excuse prospective jurors who were opposed to the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought restitution for taxes mistakenly paid by the airline to appellee city due to an attempted annexation of the airport by appellee city. The trial court held that appellant was equitably estopped from asserting its claim and granted summary judgment to appellees. On appeal, the court was required to determine whether, under general equitable principles of restitution, appellant could recover taxes mistakenly paid by the airline to appellee city as a result of a legislative mistake made over 20 years before. The court concluded that appellant stated a claim for equitable relief which authorized recovery of the disputed funds from appellee city. The court held that the facts plainly demonstrated that appellee city was enriched by the payment of taxes from the airline that should have properly been paid to appellant. Moreover, the mistake on the part of appellee revenue commissioner or the airline was insufficient to bar appellant's claim. Thus, appellant was entitled to restitution from appellee city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On its own motion, the court granted certiorari to address the interpretation of O.G.C.A. &sect; 33-34-5 by the Court of Appeals of Georgia, and that court's overruling of a prior decision interpreting the same statute. Plaintiffs' cases were consolidated by the court of appeals, and it was held in each case that defendants, plaintiffs' insurers, had complied with the provisions of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs sought recovery under their no-fault auto insurance policies that entitled them to coverage for $ 5,000 or $ 50,000 for personal injury. The appeals court held that defendants, plaintiffs' insurers, had complied with the provisions of the no-fault statute, O.G.C.A. &sect; 33-34-5. On its own motion, the court granted certiorari. Defendants asserted that the statute was unconstitutional and plaintiffs were not entitled to more than $ 5,000. Applying the statute to the contracts at issue, the court held that plaintiffs were entitled to $ 50,000 because they did not make a binding rejection of a reduction in coverage by offering a signed rejection. The court further held that the statute was constitutional, finding no ambiguity in its language. Additionally, the court concluded that although a recent decision that would have guaranteed the greater amount for plaintiffs could not be applied retroactively, this did not matter since it had already determined there was no effective reduction in coverage. Finally, the court ruled that defendants could not be relieved of their statutory duty to provide coverage simply because a tortfeasor was released.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision of the lower court and held that under the Georgia no-fault statute, absent a signed rejection, plaintiffs were entitled to recover the greater, not lesser amount provided for under the statute for personal injuries. The court further found the no-fault statute constitutional and held that the release of a tortfeasor did not relieve defendants of their statutory duty to provide coverage.</SPAN></P>

The second state habeas petition raised three constitutional issues. The third alleged that the failure of the prosecution to correct the false testimony of an accomplice and eyewitness who testified against him at his trial denied him due process and a fair trial. The State defended on the ground of waiver, contending that, with due diligence, the defense could have ascertained the necessary information. The court held that the habeas court erred in dismissing the third claim because the prisoner was entitled to a hearing on that issue because the state, by allowing the knowingly false statement to stand uncorrected deprived the prisoner of a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed finding that the failure to disperse statute was not unconstitutionally vague because, when given their ordinary meaning, the words of the statute were words of common understanding, and were sufficiently definite to inform a person of common intelligence when he was violating the law. The statute was not overbroad because its legitimate sweep outweighed any speculative deterrence to free speech, and because defendants were not arrested solely because of their speech, but because of their conduct and refusal to disperse. The court found that because defendants were not acting within the framework of constitutionally protected conduct, their arrests and convictions did not violate their First Amendment rights. The trial court's denial of defendants' motion for a mistrial due to an officer's statement that he had arrested defendants before, was not an abuse of discretion because of the strong evidence and the curative instruction.</SPAN></P>

After his grandfather refused, he was found beaten to death. Defendant was convicted of burglary and murder and sentenced to death. The court affirmed the convictions and sentences. The trial court did not err in admitting defendant's statement about the victim's death where the hope for a deal from the district attorney was a product of his own mind, rather than the inducement of others. Evidence that the victim took out a peace warrant against defendant nine months before his death was admissible to shed light on the motive of the killing. Although duplicative photos should not have been admitted into evidence, their admission was not reversible error in light of the overwhelming evidence against defendant. The jury's guilty verdicts for malice murder and burglary reflected a finding that defendant intended and participated in the murder, and it was clear that the jury found that defendant &quot;killed or attempted to kill&quot; and &quot;intended or contemplated that life would be taken,&quot; as required to assess the death penalty. The death penalty was not excessive punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Unbeknownst to the insurer, the dual agent of the parties had represented to the insured that coverage had been renewed when in fact the policy had lapsed. The court held that Ga.

An assumption could be made that a corporate insured was more sophisticated in its various business activities than was an individual insured, and the statute's purpose was to protect unsophisticated insureds. The court held that equity would not allow an insurer to be relieved of the responsibility for misrepresentations of a dual agent upon which the insured had detrimentally relied when the action was in contract, and hence, that the insurer was estopped to deny coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The plumbers were licensed under a former law that drew a distinction between locally licensed and state licensed plumbers. Under a new law, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 43-14-8(e)(2)(A), localities were not permitted to impose qualifications as to competence upon plumbers.  Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 43-14-13. The effect of the statute was to limit the plumbers' ability to practice to those localities specified in their &quot;area&quot; licenses. The court noted that the classification scheme of the statute denied to a locally licensed plumber who was familiar with the state-wide plumbing code those privileges granted to formerly state-licensed plumbers with no familiarity with the plumbing code.

In reaching its conclusion, the court noted that &sect; 9-3-71 applied to a variety of medical malpractice actions, including those giving rise to wrongful death claims, and barred suit filed more than two years after tortious conduct occurred. However, the court held that there was no rational basis for a limitation scheme in which the widow lost her wrongful death action before her husband died.

The probate court ruled that the child was the decedent's son, but that there was insufficient evidence to prove the wife's undue influence. On appeal, the superior court entered an order granting the wife's motion for summary judgment on the ground that an illegitimate child could not inherit from the decedent under the intestacy laws, former Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 113-904, in effect at the time of the decedent's death. On further appeal, the court affirmed the order. The court held that while former &sect; 113-904 was unconstitutional because it excluded significant categories of illegitimate children whose inheritance rights could be recognized without jeopardizing the orderly administration of estates, the child in the action before the court nevertheless had no right to an inheritance from his natural father because no action was taken to obtain an adjudication of paternity during the decedent's lifetime.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the act did not violate the state constitution's free speech clause, Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; I, para.

The court also held that the act withstood scrutiny under the state constitution's due process clause, Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, para.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature passed &sect; 91A-1370(d), which limited the fees the county was able to charge for the collection of unpaid school taxes for counties of a certain size, which described only the county. The county failed to lower its fees, and the school district sought mandamus. The superior court awarded mandamus against the county and limited the county's collection of fees. The county appealed. The court reversed. The court found that population classifications required a reasonable relationship of population to the subject of the statute to avoid violation of the special law prohibition of Ga. Const. of 1976, art. I, &sect; II, para. VII, Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-207. The court found that there was no rational relationship, nor had one been alleged, between the population bracket established by &sect; 91A-1370(d) and the amount a county was paid, which rendered &sect; 91A-1370(d) unconstitutional. Therefore, the superior court had erred in limiting the county's fees to lower amount. The court noted that before its opinion was issued that the parties had settled, but released its opinion for the benefit of other courts that considered the validation of population acts.</SPAN></P>

Based on a prior conviction for the same offense, he was also indicted for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2914. On appeal, defendant argued that the statute was overbroad in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as the Georgia Constitution, because it proscribed possession of a firearm by a convicted felon without creating an exception for situations in which use of the firearm by the convicted felon was used in self-defense. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court found that the trial judge instructed the jury to acquit defendant of the possession charge if his claim of self-defense was accepted. The jury rejected the self-defense claim. Thus, even if the statute was overbroad for the reasons urged, defendant lacked standing to make a constitutional attack.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant applied for immediate review of the decisions rendered by the Clayton Superior Court (Georgia) that denied defendant's motion to quash the indictment on the grounds that Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for trafficking in cocaine in violation of &sect; 79A-811(j), after a white powdery substance was found in defendant's possession. The substance weighed 56 grams, 14.3 of which was cocaine. Defendant was charged with possession of 28 or more grams of a cocaine mixture. The court affirmed the lower court's denial of defendant's motion to quash the indictment. The court held that &sect; 79A-811(j) was constitutional and did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it rationally related to an objective of the legislature to combat drug use, provided fair notice of the conduct proscribed, and did not encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. The court reversed the trial court's decision that summarily dismissed defendant's motion to suppress because defendant allegedly did not set forth sufficient facts to comply with Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 27-313(b). The court held that the motion should have been heard on the merits, as defendant's motion stated the date and location of the search, the identity of the person searched, the number of officers making the search, the identity of the material seized, and the fact that the search was warrantless and not consensual.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecutrix testified that defendant was the father of the child and that defendant refused to provide child support despite several efforts by the prosecutrix to obtain an understanding for the child's support. The jury determined that defendant fathered the child, that he was placed on notice that he fathered the child yet refused to acknowledge this fact, that the child was in need of support, and that defendant deliberately refused to support the child. In view of these findings, the court concluded that the jury, as a rational trier of fact, could reasonably have found defendant guilty of child abandonment under &sect; 74-9902 beyond a reasonable doubt. As the separate elements consisting of the crime of abandonment had an inherent logical and natural connection, &sect; 74-9902 did not violate the state's constitutional prohibition against one act referring to more than one subject matter. The court observed that in reading &sect; 74-9902 in its entirety, it became clear that that the statute dealt with only one subject matter, the crime of abandonment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also complained and that the trial court should not have admitted certain evidence. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the trial court did not err in charging the jury that they were authorized to find defendant guilty of felony murder when he was only indicted for malice murder. The court rejected defendant's argument that his possession of a firearm merged with the act of shooting and that the jury was therefore not authorized to find him guilty of felony murder. There was no merit in defendant's argument that because he was not represented by counsel in his prior felony conviction for burglary, making his conviction void, the conviction should not be permitted to serve as the underlying felony in a conviction of felony murder. The murder weapon and a photograph of the deceased were properly admitted into evidence even though defendant had stipulated as to the cause of the victim's death.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgment that restrained the father from further Wisconsin proceedings. The court held that because a child custody proceeding was properly pending in Wisconsin, it was improper for a Georgia court to exercise its jurisdiction. The court found that the Wisconsin court was exercising jurisdiction substantially in conformity with the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act by meeting the jurisdictional prerequisites of Ga.

The court affirmed, finding that the convictions were authorized by evidence of the testimony of two deputy sheriffs. The trial judge did not err in considering defendant's prior juvenile adjudications absent an affirmative showing by the state that defendant was represented by counsel in those juvenile proceedings. The state had no burden of showing that defendant was represented by counsel in those proceedings, because the prior adjudications were not criminal, and no imprisonment was imposed. Defendant cited no authority for the proposition that it would be unconstitutional to use juvenile-court adjudications to determine whether a subsequent felony conviction should be probated, and the court saw nothing unconstitutional in such a practice. Even if there was error, it was impermissible induced error, because the trial judge asked defense counsel if he would like to have the probation department run a presentence investigation to obtain all previous record as to juvenile and otherwise, to which counsel agreed and raised no objection.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the court declared void the statutory basis for the second sentence in the first of the jury findings. Defendant unsuccessfully sought habeas corpus relief in the state, then commenced a habeas corpus proceeding in the federal courts. The Supreme Court certified the question of the premises of state law that supported the conclusion that the death sentence against defendant was not impaired by the invalidity of one of the statutory aggravating circumstances found by the jury. The court answered that one ground of the statutory aggravating circumstance found by the jury failed. However, evidence of defendant's prior record was admissible aside from any relevance it had to the invalid ground. It was that record and other facts, which formed the basis for the jury's determination to have imposed the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee was officially notified that he had been declared a habitual violator and that his license and privilege to operate a motor vehicle in the State of Georgia was revoked for five years, pursuant to O.C.G.A. &sect; 68B-308 (1975). The classification of appellee as an habitual violator was based upon his convictions for driving under the influence of intoxicants. The trial court reversed the department's declaration, but the court reversed the trial court's judgment on appeal. The court rejected appellee's argument that the Department improperly considered the third conviction, which occurred in the State of Florida. The Florida offense of which appellee was convicted, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 316.193(3), driving with an unlawful blood alcohol level, provided that it was unlawful for any person with a blood alcohol level of 0.10 percent or above to drive. The Florida traffic citation showed that appellee's blood alcohol level at the time of his arrest was 0.18 percent, which constituted a presumption of intoxication under the statutes of both states and the Florida conviction constituted an offense substantially conforming to an offense of O.C.G.A. &sect; ch. 68A-p.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While conceding the state's power to adopt a policy which protected the integrity of the United States flag, defendants nonetheless contended that the governmental interest underlying the policy was not so substantial as to justify regulating the proscribed conduct with which they were charged. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. The court concluded that the people of Georgia had a substantial interest in protecting the flag as a symbol; this interest extended to regulating conduct which might seek to destroy the symbol by destroying copies of it. Further, this public interest and the method by which &sect; 26-2803 facilitated it were unrelated to the suppression of free expression. The purpose underlying &sect; 26-2803 was not to prevent the communication of ideas, but to prevent specific conduct -- deliberate acts of physical destruction and desecration to the flag. As such, the statute sought to limit only non-communicative aspects of conduct. Nor was &sect; 26-2803 void for vagueness. It was drawn with sufficient clarity so as to proscribe only physical acts of dishonor or destruction directed at the flag.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's ineffective assistance of counsel ruling was based on a finding that appellate counsel did not consider raising any issues in the prisoner's direct appeal except as related to imposition of the death sentences. Appellate counsel testified that he considered raising other issues, but that he found no other viable issues to raise. He further testified that he did not challenge the alibi charge on appeal because it was a correct statement of then existing law. The facts did not make out a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the court affirmed the grant of the petition on the ground of the burden-shifting alibi charge. The trial judge had charged the jury that alibi as a defense should have been established to the reasonable satisfaction of the jury but not necessarily beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the charge was unconstitutionally burden-shifting.

The trial court overruled defendant's demurrer to the indictments. On interlocutory appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court found that &sect; 26-2804 prohibited speech to defamatory falsehoods that tended to provoke a breach of the peace and that &sect; 26-2804 did not infringe upon the constitutional protection of the First Amendment. The court explained that to be found constitutional a statute was required to be sufficiently well-defined so that courts and juries, as well as citizens, were able to extract a standard of conduct from its language. A further requirement was that the statute be sufficiently narrow so that constitutionally protected conduct was not drawn into the sphere of its prohibition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury, in recommending the death penalty, found the existence of statutory aggravating circumstances. The victim was raped, sodomized, and stabbed 97 times. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant had contended that the trial court erred in denying her motion for a change of venue, and in failing to disqualify two jurors who had formed an opinion as to guilt. Defendant argued that by reason of extensive publicity from all the news media, a fair trial was impossible. The court disagreed with both contentions. All jurors stated unequivocally that they could put aside any opinions they had and reach a verdict based on the evidence. Second, defendant argued that the trial court erred in overruling her motion to suppress the evidence obtained from her motel room, statements given to arresting officers, and evidence obtained from the victim's car. Again, the court disagreed. While there may have been technical deficiency in the status of the issuing magistrate, there was nothing that would require suppression of the evidence obtained, and of the statements defendant made at the time of her arrest.</SPAN></P>

Also, defendant was not entitled to a particular jury instruction regarding her &quot;deprived childhood,&quot; or her &quot;sad and complex life.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Georgia State Board for Examination, Qualification, and Registration of Architects (board), challenged the judgments of the Sumter Superior Court (Georgia), which denied the board's request for permanent injunctions against the practice of architecture by appellee, the first employee and the second employee, and declared unconstitutional Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 84-301, 84-321, which defined the practice of architecture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The first employee was hired as a subcontractor. He did not participate in any amendment to the drawings or in any local adaptation of the designs. He did not hold himself out as an architect and was not licensed to practice architecture. The second employee was also not licensed to practice architecture. He also did not hold himself out as an architect and never prepared architectural drawings on a fee basis or for the general public. The court determined that the first employee was not engaged in the practice of architecture with the meaning of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 84-301 because the services performed by him were those of a specialty subcontractor, not of an architect, and a licensed engineer was utilized to prepare the technical drawings. The court explained that the second employee did not perform the services of an architect for others within Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 84-301, 84-321 because his drawings were of a sort, which could have been prepared by any contractor or owner of buildings who was conversant with proven construction methods common to the locality, and because his services were performed exclusively &quot;in-house&quot; for his employer rather than for the general public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a developer was successful in rezoning a certain tract of land from residential to commercial/office, the neighbors adjacent to the land filed a suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that as a result of the rezoning, they would be specially subjected to increased traffic, flood danger, reduced home values, and general nuisance. They alleged that the rezoning was illegal, unconstitutional and void under the charter and that as a result the ordinance allowing the change should be declared void. The trial court denied relief concluding, inter alia, that the neighbors suffered no special damage and therefore lacked standing to challenge the rezoning by the city. The court noted that it was important to keep in mind that the appeal concerned the standing of neighbors to enjoin rezoning granted a property owner, not the standing of neighbors to be heard by a governing authority when considering a proposed zoning change and affirmed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that the neighbors had not shown the substantial interest required to meet the aggrieved citizen test for standing to appeal the rezoning.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed because the neighbors did not show on appeal that the trial court's holding that they lacked standing to appeal the city's rezoning was clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff husband appealed the declaration of a mistrial by the DeKalb Superior Court (Georgia), in the husband's action for alienation of affection and criminal conversation against defendant, wife's boyfriend (boyfriend), and the boyfriend cross-appealed several of the trial court's rulings. The husband argued that the retroactive repeal of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 105-1203 did not divest him of his right of action against the boyfriend.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband learned that his wife and the boyfriend maintained an apartment together, and that his wife and the boyfriend were having an adulterous affair. However the husband continued to have sexual relations with his wife. The husband filed an action against the boyfriend for alienation of affection and criminal conversation under &sect; 105-1203. Prior to the institution of the action, &sect; 105-1203 was retroactively repealed. The trial court declared a mistrial, and the court granted the husband's request for immediate review. Both the husband and the boyfriend appealed the trial court's rulings. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the husband's allegations that the boyfriend induced the wife to share apartment expenses with him were sufficient to show that a cause of action against the boyfriend accrued and vested prior to the repeal of &sect; 105-1203. The husband's right to bring the action was not voided by his condonation and admission that he had sexual relations with his wife after learning of her adultery. Under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 38-1606, as amended, the husband, the boyfriend, and the wife were competent to testify to any issue in the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an action for alienation of affection and criminal conversation brought by the husband against the boyfriend, the court affirmed that the husband stated a cause of action that vested prior to repeal of the authorizing statute, and that the husband's right to bring the action was not voided by his sexual relations with his wife. The court reversed the trial court's rulings on the competence of witnesses.</SPAN></P>

The lower court issued a rule nisi and temporary restraining order that enjoined the City from taking further legislative action on the ordinance but allowed the sale of malt beverages and wine to continue. The court affirmed the lower court and held that in order for a plaintiff to bring a suit in equity that challenged the actions of a municipality, based solely on his status as a citizen, resident, and taxpayer, he had to allege that those actions were ultra vires.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Probation was revoked pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2723, which provided that once a probation officer made it known to a court that a probationer had failed to report to his probation officer as directed, or that the probationer could not be located in the county, the court was authorized to revoke probation without notice to the probationer. The court held that the portion of the statute that permitted revocation without notice constituted a denial of due process under Morrissey and Gagnon. The sheriff argued that Morrissey and Gagnon were not applicable to &sect; 27-2723, because a probationer waived his right to notice and a hearing by absenting himself from the county. However, the record did not show that the probationer was notified that his probation would be revoked without notice and a hearing if he failed to report or changed his place of abode without permission. The sheriff also argued that Morrissey and Gagnon were inapplicable to this case because the probationer admittedly &quot;wilfully&quot; failed to comply with the conditions of his probation.

On appeal, the court held that it could not pass upon the constitutionality of O.C.G.A. &sect; 79A-811(j) because defendant's constitutional challenge to &sect; 79A-811(j) was raised for the first time on appeal. The court rejected defendant's contention that the excluded testimony would have been relevant and admissible to explain conduct under the exception to the hearsay rule under O.C.G.A. &sect; 38-302. Because the proffer of testimony at the certification hearing indicated that the statements sought to be admitted through testimony of the three witnesses were self-serving, &sect; 38-302 did not apply.

The passengers appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passengers were injured when a vehicle struck them as they crossed an intersection. There had been a stop sign at the intersection, but it was missing at the time of the accident. The evidence showed that the county had been advised of the missing sign. The trial court awarded summary judgment to the county and official on grounds of sovereign immunity. The court affirmed summary judgment to the county, because county governments had immunity, as did the state. However, the court held that the immunity of the county official was limited to his discretionary powers and did not protect him from negligently failing to perform ministerial duties, such as replacing the missing sign. The court thus held that summary judgment in favor of the official was error. A passenger married the driver after the accident, and the court held that her action against him was barred by spousal immunity. This protection did not extend to his father as the owner of the car, however. The interspousal immunity was personal to the driver. Under an agency theory, the owner, as master, was liable for the activities of his servant, the driver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, in his capacity as an attorney, presented an appearance bond for his client. Although defendant knew the amount that bail was set for, the written order contained a typographical error as to the amount. Defendant was charged with violating O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-2408 by knowingly concealing a material fact. His demurrer to the indictment was denied. On interlocutory appeal, the court reversed the lower court's judgment, concluding that it was unnecessary to reach defendant's constitutional challenges because the indictment did not allege an offense under &sect; 26-2408. Concealing a fact by scheme, trick, or device required an affirmative act, which defendant's conduct fell short of. Defendant did not alter a judicial order. Nor was the order invalid. Defendant merely presented an order to the deputy sheriff even though he knew there was a mistake in it. While defendant's conduct might not be ethical, it was not criminal even for an attorney, who was held to the same standard as any other person. Accordingly, defendant was entitled to have his demurrer sustained and the indictment against him dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After 1980 Ga. Laws 2280 was adopted by a majority of voters in the county, the board of education adopted a resolution directing the county's board of commissioners to impose the excise taxes on alcoholic beverages as authorized by the local amendment. Appellee residents challenged the constitutionality of the local amendment. The trial court held that it violated the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court reversed the judgment. The trial court erred in placing the burden of showing the reasonableness of the local amendment on appellants because the burden of overcoming the presumption of constitutionality of legislation was on the one attacking it. All liquor sold within the county was uniformly subject to the excise taxes. Thus, while the excise taxes raised the price of liquor in the county higher than in other counties, all similarly situated persons and property within the county were treated equally. Hence, there was no equal protection violation. Because the amendment was a local amendment and the county was the political subdivision directly affected, the amendment was properly submitted to the county voters alone and was properly ratified.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the denied portion of his habeas corpus petition, claiming various constitutional violations. The court affirmed the judgment denying defendant's petition. The court found that defendant's statement to the police was obtained in violation of Edwards and should not have been admitted at the trial. The court found the exculpatory statement harmless because the statement could not have contributed to defendant's conviction. But the court held that the exclusionary ruled did not apply to evidence derived from the statement obtained in violation of Edwards, and therefore it was not error for the trial court to admit the &quot;fruits&quot; of defendant's statement. The court found that the instructions given to the jury on the presumption of implied malice for a conviction of first degree murder was error, but that it was harmless because defendant presented an alibi defense and not that the killing was unintentional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of theft by shoplifting. She appealed. The court affirmed, holding that O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-1802.1, the statute under which she was convicted, was not unconstitutionally vague. The court reasoned that there was testimony from which the jury could have concluded that defendant removed goods from the market without paying them within the meaning of &sect; 26-1802.1. Thus, &sect; 26-1802.1 clearly prohibited defendant's conduct. The court also concluded that the trial court did not err in excluding the results of a polygraph test.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence at defendant's trial tended to establish that the victim, an elderly storeowner, was stabbed 17 times and was struck in the head with a blunt instrument after he resisted defendant. Defendant was observed running from the store after he took money from the cash register and the victim's wallet. The victim died the next day. A jury found defendant guilty of armed robbery and murder. On appeal, the court held that two photographs of the victim were properly admitted because they were relevant. Further, the charge concerning mitigation was not improper because the jury was not limited in what they might consider in mitigation. Moreover, both the death penalty statute and the unified appeal procedure had been held constitutional. As there was no evidence, and no suggestion by defense counsel, of defendant's inability to distinguish between right and wrong or of acts that were the result of an insane delusion, any want of precision in the charge relative to those two principles was at most harmless error. Finally, the evidence substantiated and supported the death sentence as the murder was wantonly vile, horrible, and inhumane as it involved torture to the victim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the department contended that venue in DeKalb County was proper under the provisions of Ga.

The child was present in DeKalb County when the action was brought. The court found that the Georgia constitution was amended to provide that in juvenile cases, an action could be brought in a county other than where the parent resided.

Both parties appealed, and the court affirmed. The commissioners' creation of a new position was permissible under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 2-5901. The general assembly had the power to enact a law authorizing a county governing authority to create the officer of county manager. The County Home Rule Amendment did not limit the power of the general assembly to delegate this authority to the counties. However, the commissioners were restricted from conferring powers, duties, and responsibilities of an administrative nature to the county manager by taking them away from the chairman.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Fulton Superior Court (Georgia) held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 32-2923.1, 40-2512.1, granting property tax exemptions to appellants, a teachers' retirement system and a state employees' retirement system, were unconstitutional and required the payment by the retirement systems of both the ad valorem and excise taxes imposed upon them by appellee taxing authorities. The retirement systems appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The retirement systems brought suit against the taxing authorities to enjoin and declare void the assessment of local ad valorem and excise taxes imposed by the taxing authorities upon three parcels of property owned by the retirement systems. The properties consisted of an apartment complex, an office building, and a hotel that were acquired either through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The taxing authorities sought to collect ad valorem taxes on all three properties, as well as unpaid back taxes and hotel-motel excise tax on the hotel. The trial court found that the three parcels were within the exception to the property tax exemption provided by Ga. Const. art. VII, &sect; I, para. IV (1976). On appeal, the court concluded that the parcels were public property that did not fall within the exception to the exemption. Hence, the trial court erred in finding Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 32-2923.1, 40-2512.1 to be unconstitutional as applied. Nevertheless, the retirement systems took the hotel subject to back taxes that constituted liens and the apartment complex subject to the then current taxes. The retirement systems were also liable for the hotel-motel excise taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's holding that the retirement systems' properties were subject to the hotel-motel excise tax and back taxes, but reversed the trial court's holding that the properties were not exempt from property taxes after they were acquired by the retirement systems.</SPAN></P>

The superior court issued a declaratory judgment and granted an injunction to enforce the ordinance, which restrained the landowner from maintaining the dish in his front yard.

The court also held that the ordinance did not amount to a taking of the landowner's property because he failed to demonstrate how the ordinance was significantly detrimental to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a married couple, traveled around for the husband's employment. A motel clerk found both of their children, ages 13 months and 2 and 1/2 months, in a motel room unattended while defendants were drinking at a local bar. A Department of Family and Children Services representative described the children as very pale and thin. A pediatrician testified that the older child had been deprived of proper socialization and proper caloric intake for normal development. With respect to the younger child, the doctor testified that he did not appear to be as severely affected, appeared to be better nourished and while thin, was within the normal weight range for his age. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to authorize the convictions based on defendants' treatment of their older child. The court further held that &sect; 26-2801(a) was not unconstitutional on grounds of vagueness and overbreadth because &quot;necessary sustenance&quot; was defined as that necessary food and drink which was sufficient to support life and maintain health. Further, &sect; 26-2801(a) could not be reasonably construed to reach legitimate child rearing functions.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 3-1102 if based on the husband's death or Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-1004 if based on the husband's sore throat. The court determined that &sect; 3-1102 was not unconstitutionally applied to the executrix, the grace period provided by Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 3-1105 was reasonable, Ga. Code Ann. ch. 3-11 did not violate the Equal Protection clause, and &sect; 3-1102 did not violate due process. The court also held that the statute of limitations could not be tolled for fraud because the physician who performed the angiogram was not an agent of the hospital and there was no evidence the hospital knew Thorotrast had been used.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction, alleging that &sect; 26-1704(c) was unconstitutional in that it violated the Equal Protection Clause, the Privileges and Immunities Clause, and the Commerce Clause by elevating the criminal issuance of a bad check to a felony if it was drawn on an out-of-state bank.

On appeal, the court held that &sect; 26-1704(c) did not infringe upon defendant's right to travel because it was not based upon residency. Section 26-1704(c) classified the issuance of a check drawn on an out-of-state bank as a felony irrespective of defendant's residence. Because &sect; 26-1704(c) did not affect defendant's constitutional right to travel, the constitutional test to be applied was whether the enhancement of the crime and penalty bore a rational relationship to the distinction between the two acts. The court found that because the victim was exposed to the possibility of greater danger as a result of the delay in discovering the bad check, there was a rational reason for the enhancement. The court also rejected the argument that &sect; 26-1704(c) was a burden on interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court determined that no constitutional right to a jury existed in cases of equity. The court also found that there were no issues of fact developed in the trial court and thus the court was authorized to advance the trial on the merits and consolidate it with the hearing on the application for an interlocutory injunction. The business contended that the trial court had an adequate remedy at law by bringing criminal charges. However, the court concluded that criminal charges would not have provided full relief and was not practical and efficient.

The applicant also contended that the court lacked the authority to delegate to the Board of Bar Examiners the responsibility of grading bar examination papers in absence of specific guidelines. The court maintained, however, that it had both the statutory authority under Ga. Code Ann. ch. 9-1, appendix, p. 33, and the inherent duty, to prescribe the procedures relating to the practice of law. The court further noted that the Rules for Admission to the Bar set forth guidelines for the administration of the bar examination.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The banks argued that the state bank share tax, contained in &sect; 91A-3301, was in contravention of 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 742, and therefore, violated the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, and the Supremacy Clause of the Georgia Constitution, Ga. Const. art. XI, &sect; I, para. I. The court affirmed the judgments, finding that the share tax was not unconstitutional and concluding that the banks were not entitled to deduct the value of federal securities in determining net worth for imposition of the share tax. The court explained that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 91A-3301 provided for the taxation of bank shares held by stockholders based on the net worth of a bank without subtracting the value of federal securities owned by the bank. The court stated that 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 742 provided that treasury notes and other obligations of the United States were exempt from taxation by a state unless otherwise provided by law. The court determined that Congress, in enacting &sect; 742, did not intent to sweep away the bank share tax system of the various states because it did not make a clear intention to have done so and the legislative history did not support such an intention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed the judgment from the Polk Superior Court (Georgia) declaring the existing school finance system unconstitutional. Plaintiffs cross-appealed the judgment rejecting their assertion that the existing system of financing public education deprived the children in their district of an &quot;adequate education&quot; in contravention of Ga. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, citizens in school districts with a low property tax base, challenged both the state's education article and its equal protection clause. The trial court agreed with the plaintiffs' equal protection arguments and declared the existing school financing system unconstitutional. Defendants appealed. The court, however, rejected the plaintiffs' assertions regarding &quot;adequate education,&quot; and they cross-appealed. The judgment was reversed on main appeal and was affirmed on cross-appeal. The court made a historical analysis of the education clause and determined that the Georgia constitution did not obligate the state to equalize educational opportunities. The court deferred to the state legislature to give content to the word &quot;adequate&quot; in the Georgia Constitution. The court also held that education per se was not a &quot;fundamental right&quot; and that the Georgia public school finance system must stand because it satisfied the &quot;rational basis&quot; test. The court concluded that although plaintiffs' evidence showed serious disparities in educational opportunities and that more needed to be done to equalize these opportunities, the legislature need to provide the solutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was reversed on main appeal; affirmed on cross appeal. It is primarily the legislative branch of government that must give content to the phrase &quot;adequate education;&quot; therefore, the court deferred to the state legislature. Also, under a rational relationship test, the state system of financing public education was not invidiously discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed that the trial court erred in denying his motion for funds for a private investigator and for an examination by a private psychiatrist. The court affirmed the convictions and reversed defendant's death sentence for the armed robbery conviction. In so ruling, the court found that the evidence presented was sufficient to authorize the verdict, and that there was no merit in most of defendant's enumerations of error. The court also ruled that defendant should be resentenced for the armed robbery conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted with another and they were tried separately.

Defendant contended that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-1601(1978) was unconstitutional because no law that referred to more than one subject matter or contained matter different from what was expressed in the title was constitutional. The court rejected defendant's argument finding that &sect; 26-1601 contained no matter variant from the title and had a natural connection to the matter contained in the enacting clause. The court also held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the introduction of a microwave oven found at his former place of employment. However the court concluded that the trial court improperly sustained the State's motion when defendant cross-examined co-defendant by asking him if he stole money from a woman he was living with.

The court determined that defendant's obligation to support his children in an amount commensurate with his ability and the children's needs was a continuing statutory duty under Ga.

On appeal, the court found that because O.C.G.A. &sect; 69-705 granted the judges of recorders' courts the same powers as ex-officio justices of the peace in criminal matters, O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-401authorized such ex officio justices of the peace to hold courts of inquiry, and O.C.G.A. &sect; 27-303 gave the power to issue search warrants to any judicial officer authorized to hold such a court of inquiry, the judges of the recorders' courts had the statutory authority to issue search warrants. The court further held that there was no conflict between these statutes and O.C.G.A. &sect; 2-3001, Ga. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1, para. 1, which granted judicial powers to such courts as had been established by law. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the identity of the person who provided the information on which the warrant had been based should have been disclosed in response to his Brady motion.

The court reasoned that it was unrealistic to think that the husband-insured would do all within his power to defeat his wife's claim. The court also opined that a husband and wife who slept in the same bed, ate at the same table, and spent money from the same purse could not be truly adversary to each other in a lawsuit when any judgment obtained by the wife would be paid by an insurance company and would ultimately benefit both spouses. Lastly, the found that it would be problematic for a court to order one spouse to pay a money judgment obtained by the other in a tort action for personal injury because they live from the same purse.</SPAN></P>

To the contrary, the procedure outlined federal and state discovery rights available to defendants. Second, the court held that defendants' argument that the procedure violated the equal protection clause was without merit. The court found that the procedure benefited criminal defendants against whom the death penalty was sought by insuring that all available state and federal rights were made known to them. Third, the court held that defendants failed to demonstrate how the procedure violated Fifth Amendment rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested in Iowa for a murder he allegedly committed in Georgia. He waived extradition and was returned to Georgia, where he was tried and convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. He appealed his conviction and sentence, but the court affirmed. The court first held that defendant's confession was properly admitted. The confession had been given to Iowa and Georgia law enforcement officials after defendant had requested counsel for his Iowa probable cause hearing. The interviewing law enforcement officials were unaware of defendant's counsel request. Defendant had signed a written waiver of counsel prior to his interrogation. Under these circumstances, the court held, defendant's right to counsel was not violated. The court further held that defendant's motion for a change of venue was properly denied where no evidence of excessive pretrial publicity or juror bias was shown. Finally, the court affirmed defendant's death sentence, holding that the brutality of the murder constituted an aggravating circumstance and that defendant's sentence was not disproportionate to that of his co-defendant, who received life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Each of defendants offered money to an undercover female police officer for a sexual act to be performed with him. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the accusations on the ground that they charged conduct that did not come within the pandering statute, and that the pandering statute violated the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions because it only applied to men and did not criminalize the conduct of females who solicited acts of prostitution by males. The court affirmed a judgment of the trial court, which overruled the motions. The legislature was entitled to conclude that it was appropriate to limit the statutory deterrent to the solicitation of prostitution to solicitation by males because the risks of pregnancy and disease were adequate deterrents to the solicitation of prostitution by females. The statute did not specify that the solicitation must be for an act to be performed by someone other than the solicitor. Rather, the essence of pandering was the recruitment of females into the practice of prostitution, whether with a third person or with the solicitor himself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under O.C.G.A. &sect; 53-501, a husband was declared to be head of the household; accordingly, it had been held when he and his wife resided together, there was a rebuttable presumption that contraband found in the house belonged to the husband. Defendant argued that the presumption was unconstitutional and that the trial court therefore erred in giving a jury instruction on it. The trial court also failed to charge the jury that the presumption was rebuttable. The court stated that because the jury could have interpreted the presumption as mandatory, reversal was required. The error was not rendered harmless by defendant's out-of-court admission that the marijuana belonged to him. Furthermore, the court stated, under a United States Supreme Court decision, a rebuttable presumption that contraband found in a house belonged to the husband by virtue of his statutory status as head of the household violated due process. The fact that a husband had been declared by statute to be the head of the household did not render it more likely than not that he was the possessor of the contraband found in the house.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Less than a month before a scheduled election, the trial court ruled that the registrars had violated &sect; 34-610(c), which required that &quot;additional registration places&quot; be advertised in a general circulation newspaper at least seven days prior to the first day for registration. Thus, the trial court ruled, persons registered at such places were not eligible to vote. In reversing on expedited review, the appellate court agreed that publicity in news articles by the registrars was not equivalent to advertisement under &sect; 34-610(c) and, thus, its mandatory requirements were not met. However, penalizing the voters by disenfranchisement was an inappropriate remedy, especially since the record showed only good-faith negligence by the registrars. Other less extreme remedies were available, including mandamus to enforce &sect; 34-610(c) in the future and criminal sanctions against the registrars if they willfully abrogated their responsibilities. Also, fixed registration places that were permanent and staffed full-time, including outsourced areas such as banks, were not &quot;additional registration places&quot; subject to the advertisement requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At defendant's trial on charges of burglary, the trial court instructed the jury that evidence showing defendant's recent possession of stolen property was a circumstances along with all other evidence from which the jury might infer guilt, unless defendant explained his possession on a basis consistent with his pleas of innocence. The court of appeals affirmed his conviction, and the court granted certiorari to consider whether permitting a jury to infer guilt from recent, unexplained possession of stolen property was consistent with the due process requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, and whether the trial court's instruction unconstitutionally shifted the burden of persuasion to defendant. The court affirmed the court of appeals' judgment. Under the trial court's instruction, the jury was not required to find that defendant committed the crime on the basis of his recent possession of stolen property. The trial court also made full charges on the defendant's presumption of innocence and the state's burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, the presumption did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of persuasion to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The landowner filed a complaint in equity challenging the constitutionality of the zoning. The trial court denied relief and the landowner appealed. The court reviewed the evidence and found that the trial court did not err. The filing of a rezoning application before the appropriate governing body was a prerequisite to a suit in equity challenging the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance as applied to certain property. Not only was an application for rezoning a prerequisite to filing suit, but after an application for rezoning was denied by the governing authority, any suit in equity attacking the zoning ordinance as applied to the property involved was time barred when no suit challenging the zoning classification was filed within 30 days of that decision.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court vacated defendant's guilty plea and remanded for an indigency hearing. At defendant's guilty plea hearing, there was no indication that defendant entered her plea with adequate advice of counsel. The trial court's failure to inform defendant that if she could not afford a lawyer one would be appointed for her was reversible error. On remand, if defendant was determined indigent, she was entitled to appointed counsel. If not, she waived that right. The Dangerous Drug Act was not unconstitutionally vague. All substances in defendant's possession leading to her convictions were specifically classified by the legislature as controlled substances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The shareholder dissented to the banking corporation's reorganization, and then brought suit to enjoin the resulting merger, to have the same set aside, and for damages. The trial court dismissed the shareholder's suit, and the court affirmed. The court held that once a shareholder elected to dissent to the reorganization, his remedy was limited to the right to be paid the fair market value for his shares, pursuant to the plain language of Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 41A-2408, 22-1202. The court also held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 41A-2401 et seq., dealing with merger and consolidation of state banks, did not retroactively impair shareholders' rights so as to be unconstitutional. Under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 79-101, corporations were subject to being changed, modified, or destroyed by their creator. Additionally, under Ga. Code Ann. &sect;22-5102, the state reserved the right to withdraw the franchise unless such right was expressly negated in the corporation charter. Because the state's reserved power existed when the banking corporation was created, the legislature could constitutionally authorize per-existing corporations to merge or consolidate upon the affirmative vote of less than all the shareholders.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction of burglary by the Dade Superior Court (Georgia). He contended that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 27-313(b), which required that a motion to suppress state facts showing wherein a search and seizure were unlawful, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Before trial defendant filed a motion to suppress all evidence derived from the unlawful search of his car, which was dismissed on the ground that it did not comply with &sect; 27-313(b). Defendant claimed that to hold that a person had to show how a search without a warrant was unlawful would deny him all protection afforded by U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that defendant had not shown how the statute was in violation of the Fourth Amendment, but had merely offered an unsupported conclusion. The evidence was sufficient to support the verdict, and the arresting officer's testimony that he had received information that, shortly after the theft, defendant had been seen driving the car in which the victim's property was found was properly admitted for the purpose of explaining the officer's conduct in making the arrest. The court held that the error in admitting defendant's statement that he owned the car, without providing defendant with a written copy of the statement, was harmless. There was no violation of the Brady rule because defendant has not shown that the alleged withheld evidence impaired his defense or denied him a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother alleged that her son was the illegitimate child of the father, who had died intestate with no surviving spouse or any other minor children. The mother filed a petition that sought a year's support from the father's estate pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 113-1002. The mother attacked the constitutionality of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 113-904, which prohibited an illegitimate child from inheriting unless it was expressly provided by law. The trial court ruled that &sect; 113-904 was unconstitutional because it was contrary to the equal protection laws of the Fourteenth Amendment, but dismissed the mother's petition on the ground that she failed to serve the Attorney General pursuant to Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 110-1106, which required such service where a law's constitutionality was attacked. The court held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 113-904 was inapplicable to the proceeding. Therefore, the constitutionality was not properly decided upon, because the right of a year's support was contingent upon whether the deceased had a legal obligation to pay support during his lifetime. Because the father had made a sworn acknowledgment of his paternity of the child, his estate was subject to debt of year's support.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 26-2308(a), in which defendant corporations were accused of engaging in conspiracies in restraint of trade, the state appealed determinations of the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia) that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague. Defendants appealed denial of motions to dismiss that contended a corporation could not be charged under &sect; 26-2308(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state indicted defendant corporations for allegedly violating Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2308(a) by engaging in conspiracies in restraint of trade in transactions with the state. In considering a variety of pretrial motions, the trial court held &sect; 26-2308(a) was unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, but rejected defendants' assertion that corporations could not be indicted under the statute since it provided for imprisonment. The appellate court reversed with respect to overbreadth, holding the statute was not overbroad since it only banned speech by which persons conspired to create an unreasonable restraint of trade, or speech that constituted a clear and present danger of a substantive evil. The appellate court also held the statute was not void for vagueness, as although &quot;unreasonable restraint of competition&quot; was not defined in the statute, the common law definition of the phrase gave defendants more than fair notice that their conduct was prohibited. Finally, the appellate court affirmed that corporations could be indicted under &sect; 26-2308(a), as even though they could not be imprisoned, they could be fined in order to effectuate a sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Determination that statute was both unconstitutionally overbroad and vague was reversed, as statute only banned speech that created a clear and present danger of a substantive evil and phrase &quot;unreasonable restraint of competition&quot; was adequately defined by common law. Holding that corporations could be indicted under statute was affirmed since they could be punished through fines.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Fulton Superior Court (Georgia) for criminal interference with government property, claiming among other things that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-2613(a) was unconstitutional because it was vague, overbroad, discriminatory, ambiguous, and subject to other defects. He also claimed it was error for the trial court to deny his motion to permit his expert to examine critical evidence that was used to convict him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who painted slogans on public buildings, was convicted of criminal interference with government property. On appeal he alleged that the trial court committed numerous errors, including its refusal to allow his expert to examine the paint which was used to convict him. He also claimed that &sect; 26-2613(a), which prohibited defacing public property, was unconstitutional. The court reversed his conviction, holding that a criminal defendant on trial for his liberty was entitled to have an expert of his choosing, bound by appropriate safeguards imposed by the trial court, examine critical evidence whose nature was subject to varying expert opinion. Evidence showed that the paint was critical evidence so that defendant was entitled to a new trial after an expert of his choosing examined the paint samples. The court also ruled that &sect; 26-2613(a) was not unconstitutional. The statute was not vague because an average person of common intelligence understood from reading it that spray painting state-owned buildings was prohibited. It was not overbroad because it prohibited nothing that the state or federal constitutions protected and defendant had no right to deface the property.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that because police officers made a warrantless entry into the yard or curtilage of his home, all evidence seized as a result of that entry had to be suppressed. He further argued that the probable cause supporting the warrant pursuant to which the house was searched on a later date was tainted by the allegedly illegal search that had occurred prior. The court found that the trial court properly overruled defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized from his home on the earlier warrantless entry. The court held that under the facts of this case, the officers were authorized to enter the porch and the house itself, and the other detectives were authorized to join them there and seize evidence in plain view. The court found that the evidence factually substantiated and supported the findings of guilt and the aggravating circumstances by a rational trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also found that defendant's sentence to death for murder was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that convicted defendant of murder and sentenced him to death.

The Superior Court of Butts County (Georgia) granted the inmate a new sentencing trial, but refused relief as to the guilty phase. The State and the inmate appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate contended that he was denied a fair trial because guards were placed in various positions in the courtroom, that his rights were violated because racial and gender compositions of the grand jury and the traverse jury were dissimilar from the composition of the surrounding community, and that his rights were violated because the trial court neglected to charge the jury that it could sentence the inmate to life imprisonment even if it found the presence of aggravating factors that justified the imposition of the death penalty. As to the inmate's appeal, the court found that the inmate was not denied a fair trial by the presence of the guards who were necessary because the inmate was a federal prisoner. The court determined that the inmate failed to meet his burden of showing cause why he did not timely object to the composition of the grand jury and the traverse jury, as ineffectiveness of counsel did not satisfy the cause requirement of O.C.G.A. &sect; 50-127(1). As to the State's appeal, the court ruled that the failure of the trial court to properly charge the jury regarding sentencing violated the inmate's rights under U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 74-112 (1980) was not unconstitutional on any of the grounds advanced by appellants. On review, appellants claimed that application of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 74-112 (1980) to them was unconstitutional and that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 74-112 (1980) was in conflict with Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 74-413 (1977).

Under this statute, insurers whose insureds were involved in an accident involving two or more vehicles, at least one of which weighed more than 6,500 pounds unloaded, were allowed to pursue subrogation for benefits paid to the insured against the insurer of the tortfeasor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff's minor child was struck by an automobile insured by defendant insurance company. Plaintiff sought recovery under the insurance contract for expenses she incurred in the medical treatment of her daughter. Payment was not made by defendant until more than 60 days after the proof of loss was made. Plaintiff brought suit to recover medical expenses and sought attorney fees and penalty and punitive damages under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-3406b for the late payment of benefits. The trial court awarded medical expenses, attorney's fees, and punitive damages. Defendant appealed and asserted that plaintiff was not the real party in interest and that the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the decision, because a parent who was legally obligated to provide for her child, and who did so, was the person entitled to benefits under the insurance policy, and the statute was constitutionally firm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, because the statute under which the award was made was constitutionally sound, and the parent of an injured minor child was the real party in interest in an action to recover benefits for injuries to the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, armed robbery, possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime, and aggravated assault. On appeal, the court reversed, vacated, and remanded defendant's conviction of possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime because that crime was a lesser-included offense of armed robbery. The court also reversed, vacated, and remanded defendant's conviction of aggravated assault because that crime was a lesser-included offense in the crime of kidnapping with bodily injury. The court otherwise affirmed defendant's convictions and death sentence. The court held (1) whether expert witnesses were appointed upon motion by defendant was within the sound discretion of the trial court, and because the trial court did not abuse its discretion, reversal of the denial of the motion was not required, (2) whether defendant was entitled to sequestered voir dire was within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the trial court's decision would not be reversed because defendant failed to show substantial prejudice, and (3) defendant's death sentence was proper because the evidence showed &quot;depravity of mind.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The sister gave notice on March 3 and filed her petition on March 28. The brother was granted a continuance, and the case was heard on June 9. The superior court issued its decision on July 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The brother argued that the partition procedure set forth in O.C.G.A. &sect; 85-1511 was unconstitutional because it deprived defendants in partitioning proceedings of their procedural due process rights as guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions. Specifically, he noted that &sect; 85-1511 did not provide for service of process on a defendant nor for an adequate hearing. He further complained that an adequate interval of time was not allowed between initiation of the proceeding and its final determination by the trial court. On appeal, the court held that the brother was without standing to assert these claims on the grounds that some 97 days had elapsed between his receipt of actual notice of the action and the full hearing on the merits of his sister's claim. The court found that the brother's could not challenge the aspects of the statute he cited as being unconstitutional because the statute had not so operated as to deprive him of his rights. The court also upheld the superior court's determination that the brother had presented insufficient evidence to establish the existence of an outstanding life estate on a portion of the property that would have barred its sale.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The architect was licensed to practice in Illinois and worked for a general contractor in Georgia. The NCARB issued council certificates which permitted an architect to practice in another state without taking a licensure examination. The NCARB required three years of diversified practical experience with a registered architect for a council certificate and limited the credit given for experience with general contractors to two years. Although the architect had 8 years of experience with the general contractor, he was denied a license by the state board. Upon review, the court found that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 84-304 was constitutional because it was rationally related to the legitimate state interest of ensuring that all licensed architects were properly qualified. The court stated that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the NCARB because it was not a citizen of the forum state, and its activities were not actionable because the granting of a council certificate was within its discretion. Because the regulation was reasonable, the court found that the architect failed to state a claim for intentional interference with a business advantage. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that &sect; 79A-811(j)(3) deprived the trial judge of discretion over the sentence's severity, but the court had already held the mandatory minimum sentence constitutional. The court found that parole statutes authorized the parole board to grant parole to an inmate for a minimum and maximum term according to the indeterminate-sentence law before the person served the minimum term, so Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 79A-811(m) did not conflict with Ga. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, para. 1. The court noted that defendant received a presentence hearing, resulting in the minimum sentence rather than up to 30 years' imprisonment, which applied before the Controlled Substances Act was amended, so the punishment was not cruel and unusual. The court found no entrapment because defendant was ready to commit the offense and was only furnished an opportunity. The court asserted that denying defendant's motion to disclose the informant was not an abuse of discretion, as the state was not required to produce more witnesses than needed to present its case.

The trial court determined that Ga.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature passed a development authorities law pursuant to constitutional authority.

The authority refused to act on the resolution on the ground that the law pertaining to nursing homes was unconstitutional. The enterprise brought an action for mandamus against the authority seeking to require it to consider the bond resolution. The trial court found that the law was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the determination. The court held that the law was broad and general and that a specific provision for health care was not required to be listed in the constitution as a public purpose in order for nursing homes to be a proper project under the law.

Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 27-2534.1(b)(7).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murdering a six-year-old girl after sexually assaulting her. On appeal, the court affirmed because it found no error by the trial court. In part, the court found that evidence that the victim knew defendant, had gone to his house on the day in question, that he owned the murder weapon, that semen found on the child's coat could have come from him, that a hair sample could have come from him but not from his roommate, and that he had no alibi, was sufficient to allow a rational trier of fact to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The grand jury's initial failure to indict, followed by a deferral of a vote to indict, did not bar further prosecution for the same offense pursuant to Ga. Code. Ann. &sect; 27-702. His Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was not violated because the delay in return of the indictment was caused by failure to locate a key witness, a legitimate reason for delay. The trial court properly refused to charge the jury that he could not be convicted upon hearsay testimony as to statements of an incompetent child witness because there was corroboration of the child's testimony and she was found to be a competent witness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for murder, aggravated sodomy, and rape.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed a decision of the Superior Court of Polk County (Georgia), which held O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-1808.1, 1976 Ga. Laws 1456 and 1457 unconstitutional under the equal protection and due process clauses of the United States and Georgia Constitutions. The question arose during defendant's trial for theft by conversion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was on trial for theft by conversion, a violation of O.C.G.A. &sect; 26-1801.1. He filed a plea in bar, and the trial court sustained the plea, finding that &sect; 26-1808.1 was unconstitutional in that it created an impermissible presumption of guilt as to one of the elements of the crime and that it was vague and indefinite so as to constitute a denial of due process of law. The State appealed. The court reversed, holding that vagueness challenges to statutes which did not involve First Amendment freedoms had to be examined in the light of the facts of the particular case at hand. The statute could not be declared void for vagueness in the case at hand because it was impossible to determine the nature of the conduct giving rise to the charge. Because the constitutionality of the statute could only be tested as applied to a particular defendant under a particular charge, the trial court erred in holding the statute unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

The probate court overruled the plea to its jurisdiction and entered an order appointing the guardian. The superior court entered final judgment appointing the guardian. On appeal the court reversed, holding that the trial judge erred in charging the jury that the probate court could acquire jurisdiction to appoint a guardian for the alleged incompetent merely by reason of her being found in the county because there was testimony at the hearing from which the jury would have been authorized to conclude that the alleged incompetent remained a domiciliary of Madison County notwithstanding her move to Houston County, in that she lacked the requisite mental capacity to acquire a new domicile of choice.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that the law at the time the decree was entered applied, but it held that the law was constitutional. The court held that the modification statute was a remedial act, which allowed either the former wife or the former husband to seek relief from the terms of a previous alimony judgment.

The court found that the authority was a governmental entity, because it was statutorily created and was defined as a public body corporate and politic. It was deemed to exercise both public and essential governmental functions, and was tax exempt. The court held that a governmental entity like the authority was absolutely barred from prosecuting a cause of action for libel, regardless of whether the libel was against the entity in its governmental or proprietary capacity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two disciplinary proceedings were instituted against the attorney for alleged violations of several provisions of the Georgia Bar Rules. The special master recommended public reprimand for the abandonment violation and private reprimand for the violations concerning the conflict of interest and misrepresentation. The board, however, recommended public reprimand for all violations. On appeal, the court agreed with the board's recommendation, finding that the evidence supported the findings that the attorney violated Standards 44, 4, and 35. In the both proceedings, the court upheld the special master's findings and conclusions. The court found no error in the special master's discretionary postponement of the hearing beyond the statutory 90-day period. The court addressed the issue of the constitutionality of Standard 44, though it was not timely raised, and found that it was not vague in that it only punished abandonment that was willful, rather than negligent. Because the attorney petitioned for either a public or private reprimand for violating Standards 4 and 35, the evidentiary record was not fully developed, requiring the court to rely on the special master's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that the board's recommendation was authorized by the evidence and that the discipline recommended was appropriate.

The court found that all speech was not ultimately protected under the First Amendment, and the question was whether the words used were used in such circumstances and of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they would have brought about the substantive evils that Congress had a right to prevent. The court construed &sect; 26-1007 as prohibiting only such language as created a clear and present danger of a felony being committed, and held that the statute was not overbroad as encompassing protected speech.

The court first noted that the prohibition of ex post facto laws applied only to substantive, but not procedural rights. Under Ga.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, mayor and city council, appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Fulton County (Georgia), which granted plaintiff applicants' petition for writ of mandamus and found that a city ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and it was stipulated that there were no material questions of fact. The trial court found that the ordinance in question was not susceptible to interpretation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicants sought a &quot;consumption on the premises&quot; license to sell alcoholic beverages in the city. The application was denied based upon the Hapeville, Ga., Code of Ordinances &sect; 3-26(d), as it existed in 1977. The trial court ruled that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and therefore void. The basic question on appeal was whether the standards set forth in the ordinance were sufficiently definite to give the applicants the notice required by due process. The court found that the ordinance, which tied the number of liquor licenses for &quot;consumption on the premises&quot; to the number of city inhabitants, was not void for vagueness. The population of the city was a finite number. The only remaining question was whether the number was capable of being ascertained. The court disagreed with the trial court's conclusion that the ordinance was void for vagueness as more than one method of ascertaining the population number existed. The court noted that the federal decennial census was the standard of measure of population. Hence the ordinance in question was not vague, either as to the standard set forth or as to the method of ascertaining it. The court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court holding that the city ordinance was void for vagueness, and upheld the validity and enforceability of the ordinance licensing the sale of alcoholic beverages.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment holding that defendant's attorney did not commit any acts or omissions that constituted ineffective assistance of counsel, that the trial court did not err in admitting the codefendant's statement because it was part of the narrative of the course of events and had no effect of being probative, that all relevant testimony was properly admitted no matter how cumulative, and that the death sentence was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, the State of Georgia, appealed a judgment of the Cobb State Court (Georgia), which entered orders quashing accusations against defendant that he had abandoned his illegitimate child and two legitimate children. Defendant had argued that Ga. Code 1933, &sect; 74-9902 and the related statutes denied him equal protection because they were gender discriminatory and selectively enforced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In consolidated cases, the State had prosecuted defendant for misdemeanor abandonment of his illegitimate child, and of his two legitimate children. Contrary to the lower court's finding, the court held that the statutory scheme was not discriminatory because it subjected both parents to criminal prosecution and related to both legitimate and illegitimate children. Also, a party seeking to prove unconstitutionally discriminatory enforcement under Yick Wo had to meet the burden of presenting sufficient evidence to establish the existence of intentional or purposeful discrimination deliberately based upon an arbitrary classification. Testimony at the hearing that a prosecution for abandonment had not been brought against an illegitimate mother in the county within either the solicitor's or the trial judge's memory did not meet this burden because the solicitor testified that no illegitimate mothers had been prosecuted because no warrants had been sworn out against them. This uncontradicted testimony belied the assertion that there had been intentional discriminatory enforcement of &sect; 74-9902 during the relevant period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to violating the Georgia Controlled Substances Act.

The State brought an action to recover prosecution costs pursuant to &sect; 27-2801. The trial court denied defendant's request to satisfy the costs out of the allegedly excessive portion of his first offender fine. The trial court also denied the State's petition to satisfy the costs out of the legal fees paid to defendant's counsel. On appeal, the court held that defendant was barred from asserting that his fine was excessive because he failed to appeal his sentence and he readily accepted the benefits of first offender treatment and probation. The court also held that the trial court properly refused to satisfy the State's judgment for costs out of the fees paid to defendant's counsel because &sect; 27-2801, which created a lien on a defendant's property relating back to the arrest date, violated procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant wrote bad checks in payment of an existing debt for automobile rentals. Defendant argued that if the giving of a worthless check was in payment of an existing debt, the payee was deprived of nothing of value and the punishment was, therefore, for the underlying debt in violation of Ga. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, para. 20. The court found that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 26-1704(f) was constitutional because it did not authorize imprisonment for debt. The act of giving the check did not create the debt and in the absence of the act of writing the bad check, no violation of the law occurred under &sect; 26-1704(f), nor could it constitutionally occur. Therefore, a person who might be imprisoned for the act of giving a bad check was not imprisoned for debt but, rather, for an independent act.

Code Ann. &sect; 2-2001 and not within the scope of the confidentiality provisions of Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 77-533. While the court reversed the trial court's holding that Code Ann. &sect; 77-533 was unconstitutional under Code Ann. &sect; 2-2001, the court agreed with the trial court's denial of the motion to quash as premised on confidentiality provision. If the subpoenaed documents were found to be relevant to a legitimate grand jury investigation, the trial court must then consider whether such documents fell within the scope of the non-privileged records of the Parole Board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Since the trial court declined to rule on the relevancy of the subpoenaed documents, the court reversed the trial court's denial of the motion to quash and remanded to the trial court for an adjudication of relevancy and scope of the requested documents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced to death in the Monroe County Superior Court (Georgia) for murder. His conviction and appeal were affirmed by the court, but the United States Supreme Court reversed the sentence and remanded for a new sentencing trial. The jury again returned a verdict for the death sentence, and the case was before the court for mandatory review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court's denial of his motion for a change of venue violated his right to an impartial jury. The court disagreed because each juror expressly indicated that he or she could lay aside any opinion that he or she had formed, a low percentage of veniremen was excused for prejudice, only one recent newspaper article concerned defendant, and defendant failed to exhaust his peremptory challenges. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in having five armed deputies present in the courtroom because defendant was a convicted murderer with a record of escape. The trial court properly corrected any misunderstanding after polling the jury, and a second polling of the jury indicated that the jury was unanimous. The evidence supported a finding of the three aggravating circumstances. Although the trial court improperly instructed the jury as to the definition of kidnapping, no prejudice resulted. The murder was outrageously and wantonly vile because it involved depravity of mind of defendant and torture to the victim. A rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant either shot the victim or was present when it occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurer sought review of an order of the Glynn Superior Court (Georgia), which denied its motion to intervene in a wrongful death action filed by the administratrix of deceased against the tortfeasor and insurance carrier. The insurer asserted that the trial court erred in holding Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-3405b (d) (1) unconstitutional, the insurer had an interest in the outcome of the suit, and the insurer had a right to intervene.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurance carrier of a negligent truck driver was named as a co-defendant in a wrongful death action. The deceased was insured under an automobile policy issued by the insurer, which provided personal injury protection benefits as mandatory no-fault coverage, and optional no-fault coverage under Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-3404b. The insurer filed a motion to intervene, asserting that it was subrogated to the administratrix' claims to the extent of no-fault benefits. The trial court denied the motion. On review, the court reversed judgment and held that Ga. Code Ann. &sect; 56-3405b (d)(1) was constitutional, because the state did not violate the Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses merely by making the subrogation rights of a no-fault automobile insurer dependent upon the weight of the vehicles involved in the accident. Further, &sect; 56-3405b (d)(1) gave to the insurer, in those cases in which it was entitled to subrogation, the right of subrogation to the extent of benefits provided under both Ga. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 56-3403b, 56-3404b. The insurer was so situated that disposition of the action, as a practical matter, impaired or impeded its ability to protect its subrogation interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed judgment in favor of the insurer and held that it had a right to intervene in a wrongful death action filed by the administratrix of the deceased against the tortfeasor and his insurance carrier.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment by the Clayton Superior Court (Georgia) that convicted him of bribery based on proof that he had received money from a bar proprietor to allow the bar to remain open beyond the time that it was required to be open by the city ordinance of the town for which defendant was the mayor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that his indictment did not allege an offense, Ga.

The court reversed defendant's conviction for bribery and held that the indictment sufficiently notified defendant of the charge against him to meet constitutional requirements of notice, but that the trial judge, who was the district attorney when the investigation was conducted that resulted in defendant's charge, was disqualified to try the case against defendant.</SPAN></P>
