<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff appealed judgment of Appellate Court in the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain affirming the trial court's judgment that dismissed plaintiff's appeal of suspension of operator's license by the Commission of Motor Vehicles, based on trial court's holding that police had legally stopped plaintiff's vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">While police were conducting surveillance of suspected drug house, plaintiff drove up and stopped in front of house. Car's passenger went to door of house and returned to car. Before car was in motion, police pulled cruiser next to car and turned on cruiser's overhead lights. Plaintiff failed field sobriety tests and was arrested for driving while intoxicated. At police station, plaintiff took two breath tests, which indicated that plaintiff's blood alcohol exceeded limit under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227a. Connecticut Commissioner of Motor Vehicles (Commissioner) issued notice of suspension of plaintiff's driver's license and informed him of right to hearing. At requested hearing, Commissioner determined four elements of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b(f) were met. On appeal, plaintiff argued that probable cause to arrest element implicitly incorporated requirement of lawful stop. The court disagreed and concluded that license suspension hearing was properly limited to four enumerated issues contained in statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed judgment, concluding that the lack of reasonable and articulable suspicion to justify an initial investigatory stop was not a basis to overturn Commissioner of Motor Vehicles' decision, if Commissioner found that, subsequent to the stop, police had probable cause to arrest plaintiff for driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with two counts of murder and one count of a capital felony. Claiming that a death qualified jury denied her an impartial jury for the trial's guilt phase, defendant filed a motion in limine to restrict death penalty issues from the voir dire's scope. After the denial of the motion, defendant was convicted on all counts. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and held that the federal constitution not only permitted questioning of venirepersons regarding attitudes on the death penalty prior to the guilt phase of the trial, it also provided defendant a constitutional right to ask such questions. Further, it rejected the proposition that use of the jury death qualification process at a trial's guilt phase deprived defendant of an impartial jury. The court determined that the results were the same under Connecticut's constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment of conviction was affirmed because defendant's claim that she was denied an impartial jury due to the trial court's requiring death-qualified jurors for the trial's guilt phase failed. A death qualified jury must be empanelled for both stages of a capital case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant, convicted of a capital felony, was granted a new penalty phase hearing. At that hearing, defendant's motion in limine to restrict the plaintiff State to the normal rules of evidence with respect to evidence used to rebut mitigation was granted, and his renewed motion to compel the State to disclose exculpatory information in its possession was denied. Both defendant and the plaintiff appealed. The court held that the plain language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-46a did not require the plaintiff to shoulder a higher evidentiary standard to rebut the existence of a mitigating factor than the defendant had to in order to carry his burden of proof. Additionally, the trial court's finding that the exculpatory information, notes made by the defendant's psychiatric expert regarding admissions by the plaintiff's psychiatric expert, had already been disclosed to the defendant was not clearly erroneous, and, further, that the information itself was not material in the Brady context. Even if the information had not been disclosed to the defendant, it was not material within the meaning of Brady because it was available to the defendant through independent sources.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Judgment reversed in part and case remanded with direction to deny defendant's motion in limine. Rules of evidence were not applicable in plaintiff State's efforts to rebut mitigation; withheld exculpatory evidence was not material.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant municipality condemned plaintiff's property for the purpose of ongoing economic redevelopment. Prior to the condemnation, plaintiff and defendant negotiated unsuccessfully for the sale of the property, resulting in defendant issuing an ultimatum to either take its price or proceed to condemnation. Defendant also allegedly levied an improper alias tax warrant on the property and ordered the local police department to prevent plaintiff from gaining access to its property. Plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleging defendant violated its rights under substantive due process. The court affirmed the lower court's striking of plaintiff's complaint because defendant's actions did not rise to the level of egregiousness warranting substantive due process analysis. There were also specific constitutional provisions to protect plaintiff's property rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV, V. The state constitutional claims failed largely because the rights allegedly interfered with were economic in nature.</SPAN></P>

Trial court did not err in permitting state to cross-examine defendant's alibi witness regarding witness's failure to tell authorities about alibi where defendant failed to properly alert court that witness had previously spoken to defense counsel about alibi.

Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing to raise their challenges to the validity of the project labor agreement. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' claims for lack of standing. The court found plaintiff subcontractors had no standing to pursue the challenge to general bid specifications because, in their own capacity, they could not bid directly for government projects. Plaintiff trade association failed to establish that the use of a project labor agreement constituted an infringement of the constitutional rights of its members. Thus, it did not have standing to challenge the terms of the contract between the state and the successful bidder.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's argument the comments violated his right to an attorney or attorney-client privilege were invalid because merely calling a non-constitutional claim constitutional did not justify review.

The court held that the Secondino rule should be abandoned, because modern discovery procedures, and the elimination of the voucher rule had eliminated the need for it. However, the court held that the missing witness instruction in this case was harmless.

The trial court held a hearing and determined that the office of adult probation had such authority pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-102s (c), and issued an order authorizing community notification. Defendant appealed the order. The court affirmed the judgment, reasoning that notification to the public was a reasonable component of defendant's sexual offender treatment. Further, Conn. Gen.

Plaintiffs had filed the suit to recover moneys plaintiffs had paid in the settlement of a claim by a subcontractor arising out of defendant's alleged breach of a highway construction contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff corporations brought two separate actions within the applicable statute of limitations period and the court on appeal examined whether plaintiff could bring a third action, under Conn.

The third action was brought after the applicable statute of limitations period had expired; within one year of the determination of the last action filed within the applicable limitations period; and was not brought within one year of the determination of the first action filed within the applicable limitations period. The court on appeal concluded that such an action was, as a matter of law, time barred. The court determined that plaintiffs' federal action, which was the first to be brought, was for purposes of &sect; 52-592 (a), the &quot;original action.&quot; Because that action was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction more than five years prior to the filing of the complaint in the present action, plaintiffs could not rely upon &sect; 52-592 (a). The case was filed less than one year after the dismissal of the first state court action, which was brought within the statute of limitations period, but the court found that the federal action, filed earlier, was the &quot;original action.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Dismissal of plaintiffs' action was affirmed because the suit was time barred.

The court concluded that although a writ of error could be brought, a bail bondsman, as a nonparty, did not have a right of appeal under &sect; 52-263. Applying principles of statutory construction, the court held that the proper interpretation of the term &quot;party&quot; for purposes of &sect; 52-263 included only actual parties to the underlying action. Further, the court expressly adopted a bright-line test requiring appellant, in order to establish a right of appellate review pursuant to &sect; 52-263, to establish in the following sequence that (1) it was a party to the underlying action; (2) it was aggrieved by the trial court decision; and (3) the appeal was from a final judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant sought review of the judgment from the appellate court (Connecticut), concluding that further criminal proceedings were not barred by the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const. amend. V, and affirming the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss, in an action charging defendant with offering to perform home improvements without being registered as a contractor in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-427(b)(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with violating Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-427(b)(5). Defendant claimed that because the trial court rendered a judgment of acquittal in his trial, further prosecution was barred by his constitutional right not to be placed twice in jeopardy for the same offense. The state maintained that the trial court's judgment did not constitute an acquittal for purposes of double jeopardy because it was based solely on defendant's statute of limitations defense, and not on a determination that the state's evidence regarding any element of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-427(b)(5) was insufficient to support a guilty verdict. The court agreed with the state. Defendant's statute of limitations defense was not a defense that, when proved, negated any element of the offense or established a legal justification for an otherwise criminal act. The trial court's judgment was based solely on defendant's statute of limitations defense and not on any resolution in favor of defendant of any element of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 20-427(b)(5). Thus, the judgment rendered by the trial court did not constitute an acquittal for purposes of double jeopardy, and defendant could be retried.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment affirming denial of defendant's motion to dismiss was affirmed because the court found that defendant's midtrial acquittal based on his statute of limitations defense did not constitute an acquittal for purposes of double jeopardy, and consequently, the legal restraints of the law pertaining to defendant's double jeopardy rights did not bar a retrial.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted defendant's motion to suppress and subsequent motion to dismiss. State appealed by permission and a five-judge court affirmed. The state moved for reconsideration en banc and the court reversed. It held that U.S. Const. amend. IV did not require suppression of the illicit drugs seized by an agent of the state, lawfully present in the defendant's bedroom, who observed a substance that a reasonably prudent firefighter would have believed to be drugs.

The state supreme court granted certification to appeal the important question of whether a habeas corpus petitioner who claimed actual innocence of the crime of which he stood convicted must establish that the claim of innocence was sustained by newly discovered evidence. Finding that the case did not present facts that squarely and necessarily required such question to be addressed, the court dismissed petitioner's appeal on the ground that certification was improvidently granted. Because the state supreme court did not decide whether petitioner's claim of actual innocence must be based on new evidence, the issue should be regarded as an open question in the court's habeas jurisprudence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Commissioner of Revenue Services, thus denying plaintiff trustee's request for refunds of 1993 income taxes paid on four testamentary and one inter vivos trust. Plaintiffs appealed, contending that the taxation scheme, as applied, violated the due process clause and commerce clause of the constitution. All of the trusts were resident trusts as defined by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-701(a)(4). The court held that the taxability of the income of the resident testamentary trusts was based on the fact that the testators were Connecticut domiciliaries at death. The income of the inter vivos trust was taxable because both the settlor of the trust when the trust was established and the beneficiary were Connecticut domiciliaries. The contacts between the trusts and the state were sufficient constitutionally to treat the trusts as if they were domiciliaries of the state and, therefore, to tax their undistributed income. The court also concluded that any incentives and risks had not been sufficiently established so as to result in a dormant commerce clause violation. The court found the denial of refunds was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the judgement below denying refunds for the tax paid on the trusts, on the grounds that the contacts with Connecticut were sufficient to satisfy the due process clause, and gave the trusts fair warning that they were subject to its tax jurisdiction. The state was entitled to tax all of their income, wherever generated, like that of other domiciliaries. No dormant commerce clause violation was established.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's untimely challenge to the assessments or awarding fees and costs. The court properly reasoned that the 111 cases were not for the recovery of the same demand because each lot was a separate tax entity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Judgments of strict foreclosure of municipal real estate tax liens in favor of plaintiff city affirmed in all respects, because the trial court did not abuse its discretion, except for the award of sheriff's fees, which was reversed to be reduced drastically and recalculated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The Workers' Compensation Review Board (Connecticut) reserved questions of law pending in plaintiff employee's appeal of a decision from the Workers' Compensation Commissioner for the Eighth District, which had denied plaintiff's application pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-308(b) for permanent partial disability benefits for damage to his skin in a propane fire that occurred while he had been employed by defendant corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On appeal, the court found that, by the plain language of the Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-308(b), the workers' compensation commissioner was only authorized to grant compensation for the loss or permanent partial disability of a scheduled body party or organ, noting that there was no provision that provided the commissioner with discretion to award compensation regarding an unscheduled body part or organ, such as skin. The court then noted that, as neither a fundamental right nor a suspect class was at issue, the rational basis test was the appropriate standard for determining the constitutionality of the classification under the statute. The court held that the statute did not violate the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions where the legislature's legitimate interest in reducing the costs of the workers' compensation system was a rational justification for constructing Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-308(b). The court remanded with direction to affirm the decision of the commissioner, declining to discuss the due process challenge because plaintiff had not provided sufficient argument in support of such claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court remanded with instructions to affirm the denial of plaintiff employee's application for permanent partial disability benefits for damage to his skin, finding that the statute which authorized the workers' compensation commissioner to award compensation regarding scheduled body parts and organs, which did not include skin, did not violate constitutional equal protection provisions where there was a rational basis for the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">On appeal, the court rejected the contention that Conn. Gen.

The court noted that the lack of knowledge by defendant or a person in his particular age category did not enhance his vagueness challenge to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-71. The court then upheld the validity of defendant's conviction where the challenged information, which charged a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21, was not so obviously defective that by no reasonable construction could it have been said not to have charged the offense for which conviction was had. The court affirmed the adjudication of guilt, finding that the legislature's articulated reasons for enacting Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-71, namely, the prevention of teenage pregnancy and the limitation of the opportunity of more sexually experienced adolescents to take advantage of those much younger, provided a rational basis the statute's enactment.</SPAN></P>

The affidavit was based on statements from informants who that conflicted with the testimony of neutral witnesses in descriptions of the shooter. One informant had failed to identify plaintiff in two previous statements. The court found that these omissions materially contributed to the objective basis for finding probable cause.

Plaintiff moved to dismiss. The commission issued a reasonable cause finding for employee, and denied plaintiff's motion.

Acts 96-241 gave the commission jurisdiction in all cases in which it failed to meet time deadlines, application of 1996 Conn.

The court reviewed the trial court's rejection of defendant's Batson claim under the clearly erroneous standard of review and upheld the trial court's decision that each peremptory challenge was supported by valid, race neutral reasons.

In an action by plaintiff statewide grievance committee, the trial court suspended defendant from the practice of law for six months. Plaintiff claimed on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion when it (1) suspended defendant from the practice of law for only six months and (2) did not discipline defendant further because of his admission at the presentence hearing that he had made certain misrepresentations in federal court. The appellate court found that under Conn. Gen.

On defendant's petition for certification, the court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-91a applied only to felony convictions in a Connecticut state court.

Stat. &sect; 45a-724(a)(1) that only a statutory parent may give a child in such an adoption. Respondent review board denied petitioners' resulting application for such a waiver. Petitioners appealed the lower court's dismissal of their probate court appeal. Respondent review board appealed the lower court's decision to pursue a waiver application through remand. The court considered petitioners' and respondent's appeals pursuant to Conn. Gen. Practice Book &sect; 4023 (now &sect; 65-1), and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-199(c). Basing its decision on a literal reading of &sect; 45a-724(a)(1) that did not provide for waiver, the court held that respondent review board's decision to deny petitioners' adoption petition was not reviewable. Finding respondent review board to be an agency within the meaning of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 1-166(1), the court thus affirmed the dismissal of petitioners' probate appeal. On similar grounds, the court reversed the lower court's decision to remand.</SPAN></P>

D. Michael Hurley, judge trial referee, who granted the defendant's motion to dismiss and, exercising the powers of the Superior Court, rendered judgment thereon, from which the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, Foti, Schaller and Spear, Js., which affirmed the trial court's judgment, and the plaintiff, on the granting of certification, appealed to this court.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The zoning board of appeals of defendant town denied plaintiff landowner's application for a zoning variance. The Appellate Court (Connecticut) affirmed the trial court's decision, concluding that the landowner's inverse condemnation action was premature because its administrative appeal from the denial of its application for a variance was not yet final and, therefore, the action was not justiciable. The landowner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After the town's zoning board of appeals (board) denied the landowner's application for a variance to the zoning regulations, the landowner appealed the board's decision regarding its variance application to the trial court. The landowner filed a separate complaint claiming inverse condemnation of the property. The trial court granted the town's motion to dismiss the inverse condemnation action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the pending appeal of the board's decision. The court found that the board's denial of the variance application constituted a final decision that rendered ripe for adjudication the inverse condemnation claim. The regulatory action upon which the taking claim was based was complete when the board, as the initial decision-maker, denied the application for a variance, and the inverse condemnation action then became justiciable. The exemption from the exhaustion doctrine was applicable to pure taking claims. The necessity of submitting multiple plans was not a per se rule but was based on the circumstances of each case. Submission of additional plans would have been unavailing and, thus, was not a requisite to establishing finality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court. The case was remanded to the appellate court with directions to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings according to law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was read Miranda rights and signed a rights waiver. Defendant was transferred to a different police unit, since there was a warrant for his arrest, signed a rights waiver, and first gave those police an alibi and then voluntarily admitted being at the scene of the shooting. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress his statements since, without deciding whether the sobriety checkpoint was reasonable, defendant's statements were not the product of the initial stop. The court compared the Colvin and Daugaard cases where the statements were the product of the execution of a valid arrest warrant and subsequent lawful interrogation. That defendant was already in custody merely facilitated the execution of the valid arrest warrant. Defendant was not questioned about the killing by the checkpoint officers. The evidence was sufficient to convict. In context, the reasonable doubt instruction was proper, not a constitutional magnitude violation, and so not entitled to Golding plain unpreserved error review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant school board appealed the decision of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Litchfield (Connecticut) that granted plaintiff student's application for an injunction prohibiting enforcement of plaintiff's expulsion from school on the grounds, inter alia, that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233d(a)(1) was unconstitutionally vague as applied to plaintiff and on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff student was arrested for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia that were found in plaintiff's car off the school campus. After a hearing before defendant school board, plaintiff was expelled from school for violating Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233d(a)(1), which allowed expulsion for off campus activity that seriously disrupted the educational process. The court affirmed the lower court's grant of the injunction but found that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-233d(a)(1) was not unconstitutional on its face. The court held that &sect; 10-233d(a)(1) was unconstitutional as it was applied to plaintiff because it did not give a reasonable person notice that possession of marijuana was the type of activity that would be considered seriously disruptive of the educational process. Plaintiff was not provided with constitutionally adequate notice that his behavior would result in expulsion. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague on its face because it did give notice that other conduct, such as phoning in a bomb threat, was clearly disruptive of the educational process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The order of the trial court granting the plaintiff student's application for an injunction was affirmed because the statute under which plaintiff was expelled did not give plaintiff constitutionally adequate notice that his conduct could lead to expulsion. The order was reversed insofar as it concluded that the statute at issue was facially unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant alleged that the legislative classification of larceny from the person as a class C felony, and simple robbery as a class D felony, violated his rights to equal protection of the laws under the federal or state constitution. He contended that his rights were violated because larceny was a crime of a less serious nature than robbery and the statutory penalties were more severe for the less serious crime. On appeal the court affirmed the conviction, holding that the legislature rationally could have concluded as a categorical matter, larceny from the person was a more serious offense than simple robbery, and therefore warranted a more severe penalty. Trespass to the person of the victim that inheres in larceny from the person potentially was a source of greater harm than the force or threat of force that characterizes a simple robbery. Alternatively, the legislature might have considered the ease with which the crime potentially could be committed. Either way, for purposes of rational-basis review, articulation of the legislative rational was unnecessary, so long as the court conceivably or reasonably be related to a legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>

As a result of the deferment of the 1993 revaluation, the corporation's tax bill on the 1993 grand list was increased by 39 percent over what it would have been had the 1993 revaluation been implemented.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff insured was injured in an automobile collision, and he received the entire amount of the negligent driver's liability coverage. Plaintiff filed an action to recover under the underinsured motorist provision of a policy issued to him by defendant insurer, and the trial court refused to offset defendant's liability by amounts plaintiff would receive as social security disability benefits after determining that this reduction would be contrary to public policy. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that both Conn. Agencies Regs. &sect; 38a-334-6 (d) and the language of the policy unambiguously allowed defendant to offset the available underinsured coverage by the social security benefits paid or payable to plaintiff. The court found that the regulation was within the scope of the authorizing statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 38a-336, and it was not contrary to the legislature's intent. Allowing an offset for social security benefits did not conflict with the statutory intention to guaranty a minimum level of compensation to all motorists equal to the coverage of their own policy without allowing multiple compensation for the same harm.

The principal issue on appeal was whether, after a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel, a habeas court had the authority to restore petitioner's right to sentence review under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-195, after the statute's 30 day time limit has passed.

Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 23-29 (3). The 30 day time limit did not act as a jurisdictional bar to consideration of an application for sentence review that was delayed by reason of ineffective assistance of counsel.

Another defendant was charged with sexual assault. Pursuant to the provisions of the newly enacted Conn. Gen.

The court found the statute did not deny the defendants procedural or substantive due process because the defendants had no liberty or property interest in their juvenile status. Moreover, prosecutorial discretion in whether to prosecute the defendants as adults or as juveniles was not a denial of due process, nor was it a denial of equal protection. The statute did not facially treat similarly situated individuals differently and the defendants presented no evidence, nor even an allegation, of unequal treatment in practice.

The husband was the child's natural father, but the natural mother had been a surrogate. The parental rights of the surrogate and her spouse had previously been terminated, but the wife had never formally adopted the child. Incident to a dissolution proceeding in a divorce between the husband and wife, the issue of the child's custody was raised. The trial court ruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under &sect; 46b-56 to adjudicate the custody issue because the child was not a &quot;child of the marriage.&quot; On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a prompt trial with respect to custody. Specifically, the court held that while the child was not &quot;a child of the marriage,&quot; the trial court, nevertheless, had jurisdiction under &sect; 46b-56 to adjudicate the custody issue as between the husband, as the child's father, and the wife, as a third person asserting a claim to custody of the child. The court also held that given the undisputed facts of the case, the statutory presumption in favor of a parent over a nonparent, as afforded by &sect; 46b-56b, had been rebutted as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that (1) the language in the deed did not contemplate unrestricted vehicular access to the street so the regulation did not violate the terms of the deed, (2) the enforcement of the regulation represented a legitimate use of the city's police power to advance economic, aesthetic and safety-related goals, (3) the street closings did not interfere with the use of the property to such a degree so as to constitute a taking of the property, and (4) the property owners did not prove that they were singled out to bear an economic burden and the street closings merely posed a minor inconvenience to persons seeking access to the properties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The parents filed suit against the officials when their child was taken into temporary custody after an allegation of neglect.

The officials filed a motion to strike the parents' complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The trial court granted the motion to strike the claim for injunctive relief but denied the motion to strike the claim for declaratory relief. Both parties appealed. The court held that the parents' claim was justiciable. The officials were bound to act within constitutional principles, and the court, through an evidentiary proceeding could disclose whether the alleged violations could be remedied. The parents' claims were appropriate for redress through declaratory judgment because they could not effectively challenge the denial of a meaningful and timely hearing in any other way, and because there were no other viable avenues available to them. Sovereign immunity did not bar the parents' claims for injunctive relief against the officials, so the motion to strike this claim was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's grant of the officials' motion to strike the parents' claim for injunctive relief because this claim was not barred by sovereign immunity.</SPAN></P>

The court held that any possible risk of jury confusion over the element of intent was eliminated by the trial court's numerous proper instructions on the elements of murder. The court found that the trial court properly informed the jury that it had to decide whether defendant was intoxicated at the time of the offense and, if so, whether that intoxication rendered him incapable of forming the intent required for the charged offenses. The court held that while the trial court used the phrase &quot;reckless indifference manslaughter,&quot; there was no reasonable possibility that the jury could have been misled regarding the requirement of extreme indifference.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-107. The state argued the trial court lacked the authority to dismiss the charge based on its belief that a jury trial was not warranted. The court transferred the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was indicted for criminal trespass based on a police report made by his employer that defendant was seen on the employer's property after being fired because he was suspected of stealing and being told to leave the premises.

It further stated that it would be embarrassed to put the case before a jury and unless the state reduced the charge, it would decide the matter. The state refused, and the trial court dismissed the case. On appeal, the court held that the trial court had no authority to dismiss the charge absent a constitutional infirmity or other fundamental defect in the state's exercise of its prosecutorial authority. The court ruled that the record clearly showed that the judge did not dismiss the case on the ground of evidentiary insufficiency, nor did it weigh all relevant factors under Conn. Gen.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-281, for students attending private school even when the public schools were not in session. The appeal was transferred to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State Board held that the private school was improperly denied transportation when the public schools were closed. The court affirmed the trial court's decision in favor of the State Board and found, inter alia, that (1) the underlying transportation request by defendant parents was not moot because the case involved an active controversy where the Town Board indicated a disposition to continue denying transportation; (2) the State Board could address not only the mootness decision but also the case merits because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 10-186 empowered the State Board to hear appeals de novo; (3) the State Board's decision resolved a contested case because legal rights were determined; (4) the plain language of &sect; 10-281, the &quot;same kind of transportation services,&quot; meant that the students would ride to and from school under the same safe and reliable conditions, rather than meaning that transportation should only occur when the public schools were in session; and (5) &sect; 10-281 did not violate U.S. Const. amend.

The court disagreed with defendant's argument and affirmed his convictions. The court held that defendant failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony. The court concluded that the trial court reasonably could have concluded that the prior consistent statement regarding the telephone threat was admissible for rehabilitative purposes in light of the possibility that the jury might otherwise have drawn an inference of recent fabrication of his trial testimony on that subject.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut) that convicted him of arson in the first degree. On appeal, he contended that the trial court improperly failed to suppress the results of a chemical analysis conducted pursuant to a search warrant in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV, and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was convicted of arson, a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-111(a)(4). On a prior appeal, the court concluded the state's chemical testing of defendant's burned clothing without a warrant constituted an unreasonable search in violation of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, and reversed the conviction. State then applied for and obtained a search warrant to test defendant's clothing. Defendant moved to suppress the results of the test at his subsequent trial for arson, but that motion was denied. He was thereafter convicted, and sought review. On appeal, he challenged the legality of the second search. The court held that: (1) the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress, as police had an independent basis for the possession and testing of the clothing, and the underlying search warrant was supported by probable cause; (2) the trial court was not collaterally estopped from admitting evidence of insurance proceeds as a motive for defendant to commit arson; and (3) state's failure to preserve certain evidence did not deprive defendant of a fair trial in violation of his due process rights. The trial court's judgment of conviction was thus affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court's judgment that convicted defendant of arson was affirmed. Chemical testing of defendant's clothing for flammable chemicals did not constituted an unconstitutional search of defendant's person, as police obtained information in support of the underlying warrant from an independent source. Additionally, sufficient evidence supported defendant's conviction for arson.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-470(b). The Appellate Court (Connecticut) affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the inmate's second petition as untimely without reaching the merits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The inmate claimed that Conn. Gen.

The court overturned the appellate court's ruling and held that the inmate's habeas petition was not time-barred by &sect; 52-470(b). In so holding, the court found that 1) the legislature intended the language of &sect; 52-470(b) to define the scope of review and not to limit the jurisdiction of the appellate court; 2) a habeas writ was a proper remedy for an ineffective assistance of habeas counsel claim; and the remedy extended to claims alleging ineffective assistance of appellate habeas counsel; 3) the inmate properly established that his counsel's failure to timely file his first habeas petition fell below the objective standard of reasonableness; and 4) the inmate was not required to establish actual prejudice or the likely success of his petition for certification on appeal, as he was deprived of the opportunity to seek review of a habeas judgment solely due to ineffective counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The employee received workers' compensation benefits after he was involved in an automobile accident while driving the employer's vehicle. The employer sued defendants in order to recover the workers' compensation benefits that it paid to the employee. Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-293 (1997), the employer notified the employee of the initiation of the lawsuit, however, the employee was not informed that his action against defendants would abate if he failed to intervene within 30 days. The employee then filed his negligence action against defendants more than 30 days after receiving the notice. Defendants' motion for summary judgment on grounds that the employee's action had abated was granted. In reversing the judgment, the court held that the notice was constitutionally inadequate under the federal Due Process Clause to support a complete abatement of his cause of action because it failed to notify the employee of the consequences of his failure to intervene in the action within 30 days of the notice. Therefore, the abatement of his claim based upon his failure to intervene in a timely fashion, unconstitutionally deprived him of his property interest in his legal claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment, which had granted summary judgment for defendant, and it remanded the case for further proceedings. The court specifically delineated a new procedure to bring the notice provisions of the abatement statute in compliance with the federal due process clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant was charged with capital murder in connection with a sexual assault that resulted in the death of the victim. The Superior Court (Connecticut) granted defendant's motion to dismiss a capital felony count. The state, on the granting of certification pursuant to Con. Gent. Stat. &sect; 52-265a, filed an expedited appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant and another man were charged with killing a woman in the course of a sexual assault. Defendant objected to a capital felony count on the ground it would have caused confusion for a jury because the murder count alleged that defendant had aided the other perpetrator to commit the murder. The trial court dismissed that count. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the dismissed count provided defendant with constitutionally adequate notice of the charge sufficient to enable the him to prepare a defense, (2) the legislature intended the provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54b(7) to encompass the situation where a defendant aided another in killing a victim during a sexual assault, (3) defendant could be convicted of a substantive offense, through the use of accessory principles even though he had not committed the substantive offense because the accessory statute merely provided an alternate means for the substantive crime to be committed, (4) an early probable cause determination was not determinative of the offenses defendant could have been convicted of, (5) defendant could be convicted as an accessory even though he was charged only as a principal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the dismissal of a capital murder count against defendant because the dismissed count adequately apprised defendant of the charge against him and there was no substantive reason for confusion concerning his role as either an accessory or a principle. Furthermore, preliminary determinations were not binding on the final outcome of the case.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the statute had a core meaning that was sufficiently clear to satisfy the due process requirements of the state and federal constitutions. The terms &quot;container&quot; and &quot;secure&quot; were given meaningful substance by their context within the framework of the statute as a whole. The inclusion of a reasonable person standard in the statute was not impermissibly vague. The statute was not vague as applied to defendant's conduct as a fact finder could reasonable find that he did not use an appropriate physical impediment to restrict his children's access to the gun. Because defendant did not demonstrate that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-217a was vague as applied to his conduct, he could not mount a facial challenge to the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The bank brought separate actions, as payee, against the makers of promissory notes that were payable on demand. The bank sought to recover the balances due on promissory notes executed by the makers. The makers were among a group of investors in a now defunct partnership. The makers did not deny that they had executed the notes or that demand had properly been made; they alleged that the special defense under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 36-498(g) that the promissory notes were unenforceable as contracts in violation of Connecticut Uniform Securities Act (CUSA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 36-470 et. seq. (1993). The trial court found that the bank was barred from pursuing these actions because it violated the provisions of CUSA in that the bank acted as an agent of the seller who perpetrated the fraud. On appeal, the court rejected the trial court's theory that the bank, as a corporate entity, was an agent and held that only a natural person could be an agent under CUSA for a violation under &sect; 36-498(c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The State of Connecticut challenged a decision of the Appellate Court (Connecticut), which affirmed the superior court's suppression of drugs seized from defendant's vehicle. The seizure occurred after police officers had ordered defendant to accompany them to his vehicle. One of the officers then looked through the window and observed the bag in plain view.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The police had observed defendant for 25 minutes sitting 200 feet from his car, but had not witnessed any sale of narcotics or act giving the appearance of a sale when they approached him and ordered him to accompany them to his vehicle. The parties assumed on appeal that the police detained defendant illegally. The court noted that not all evidence that would not have been discovered but for the illegal action of law enforcement officials was fruit of the poisonous tree. The court stated that the first issue was whether the allegedly tainted evidence was in some sense the product of illegal government activity. The court determined that the trial court had heard no evidence supporting the conclusion that the discovery of the narcotics was the product of the unlawful arrest. The court concluded that the police had a perfect right to be where they were and to observe the cocaine notwithstanding the wrongful detention. Because there was no evidence indicating a causal connection between the arrest and the discovery of the drugs, the court ruled the evidence should not have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and remanded the case to that court with direction to remand the case to the trial court with direction to deny the motion to suppress and to reinstate the information and proceed according to law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Appellee workers' compensation insurer sought to transfer to appellant second injury fund the claim of an employee who suffered permanent total disability due to the combination of a new injury with preexisting permanent conditions. The trial commissioner denied the request on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-349c required a panel of three physicians to decide the matter. The workers' compensation review board (board) held that &sect; 31-349c applied prospectively only and reversed. Appellant sought review and contended that the legislature intended &sect; 31-349c to apply retroactively to cases in which the claimant's second injury predated the effective date of the statute. The court agreed and held that the evidence that the legislature intended the statute to apply retroactively was sufficient to rebut the presumption of prospective application. Appellee asserted constitutional challenges to &sect; 31-349c, but the court concluded that the arguments were not ripe for review. The court reversed the decision of the board and remanded the case to the board with direction to remand it to the commissioner for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The sole issue raised by this appeal was whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-25, which established procedures relative to the appraisal of property for which a judgment of foreclosure by sale had been rendered, violated the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The court held that because the filing procedure mandated by &sect; 49-25 afforded the individual adequate notice of the relevant appraisal, the procedure did not run afoul of constitutional requirements. The court also held that because fundamental fairness required that an evidentiary hearing be allowed upon a proper request, a foreclosure court necessarily had the inherent equitable power under &sect; 49-25 to grant such a request. The court therefore concluded that because the individual would be afforded an evidentiary hearing at which he could challenge the court-ordered appraisal prior to any action by the trial court on plaintiff bank's motion to approve the sale of the property, the individual's due process claim had to fail.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that Connecticut's judges served a gatekeeping function with regard to scientific evidence and that there had to be some scientific validity involved in the test before it might be admitted. With polygraph examinations, the court stated there is little probative value to the test and the accuracy of the test could readily be questioned.

He appealed from his conviction, arguing that his rights to due process and equal protection were violated. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's substantive due process rights were not violated. The legislature's decision to grant preverdict benefits and, therefore, to determine youthful offender status before trial, was rational. The court noted that a defendant who was convicted of a lesser included crime, but was acquitted of the class A felony that statutorily deprived him of youthful offender status, was unable to apply for postverdict benefits. The court held that such a result did not violate defendant's substantive due process rights. Also, it was rational for the legislature to exclude from youthful offender eligibility those defendants charged with murder. The youthful offender statutes did not violate defendant's right to equal protection because a rational basis existed for the classification. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence proffered by defendant on the basis of its irrelevance to defendant's self-defense claim.</SPAN></P>

In the appeal of defendant's conviction for risk of injury to a child, the court concluded, based on principles of statutory interpretation and definitions of the term &quot;health,&quot; that the first part of &sect; 53-21 encompassed injury to the child's mental health. The plain language of the first part of the section indicated the legislature's understanding that the broad class of intentional conduct that could harm a child included mental, as well as physical health. No physical contact by the defendant was required for conviction. The court further held that &sect; 53-21, as interpreted to include injury to a child's mental health, was not unconstitutionally vague. A person of ordinary intelligence would know that health in the first part of the section would include mental health, and that the person would have fair warning that using threats to force a child to publicly urinate in a cup would constitute a violation of the section.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the subcontractor was entitled to recover lost profits only for work actually performed. The court further held that the subcontractor was entitled to damages for labor and material items, for the cost of standby labor, and for the liquidation value of the steel. The court determined that the subcontractor was not entitled to recovery for the extra costs of subsurface conditions because the subcontractor should have anticipated and made allowance for the conditions. The court held that the subcontractor's unified offer of judgment was properly made under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a. Therefore, the court concluded that the trial court properly awarded offer of judgment interest.

The court agreed with the trial court on all issues except the finding that plaintiffs had standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 30-63(c). Thus, the matter regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 30-63(c) was not reviewed. The court found that &sect; 30-6-A29(f) was a valid exercise of the department's regulatory authority because federal law did not permit plaintiffs' promotional scheme which was the basis for the suspension of their license. Furthermore, the 400-day suspension was not reversible by the court because the suspension of beer permits was primarily an administrative function in the exercise of an executive power.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the trial court denied the waste company's request to amend its answer to allege misconduct on the part of the town while the case was proceeding. The trial court issued a permanent mandatory injunction, among other things, ordering it to remove all waste deposited at the landfill above the height of ninety feet.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Section 21a-278(a) provided for a minimum prison term of not less than five years and not more than 20 years and a maximum term of life imprisonment for sale of an aggregate weight of one ounce or more of cocaine or an aggregate weight of one-half gram or more of cocaine in a free-base form. Defendant contended that this violated the equal protection for the law as there was no rational basis for providing the same penalty for possession of a half a gram of free-based cocaine as the penalty for possession of one ounce of cocaine in powder form. The court ruled that defendant had waived his equal-protection claim because the claim was not raised before trial by way of a motion to dismiss the information; Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Sup. Ct. &sect;&sect; 810, 815 required that a claim that the law defining the offense charged was unconstitutional be raised by a motion to dismiss the information.

The court began its analysis by concluding that grandparents' reading of the statute would have allowed any person to petition a trial court for visitation rights, no matter how remote his or her connection was to the child. The court also noted that at common law, grandparents had no right to visitation. After studying the rules of statutory construction and examining the legislative record, the court concluded that the legislature intended &sect; 46b-59 to afford the trial court jurisdiction to entertain a petition for visitation only when the minor child's family life had been disrupted.

The trial court granted the petition and appointed a receiver and a lien was entered against the owner's property in the amount of the unpaid utility charges. On appeal, the court concluded that the determination of the amount that the owners owed at the &sect; 16-262f proceeding did not preclude the owners from fully litigating whatever counterclaims they may have had against the company at a later time and in a separate forum. Accordingly, the court held that a &sect; 16-262f hearing did not impinge on the owners' procedural due process rights. The owners were not permitted to litigate their counterclaims during the receivership hearing because it would violate the statute, which limited the hearings to a finding of the amount of arrearage.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The charges against defendant stemmed from his role in the arson of an apartment that resulted in the death of two people.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54b. The state argued that the term &quot;murder&quot; in the capital felony statute was a generic term that broadly and unambiguously referred to alternate methods for committing the crime of murder, and thus, encompassed unintentional as well as intentional murder. Defendant argued that the term &quot;murder&quot; unambiguously was limited to homicide in its most aggravated form, namely, intentional murder, and alternatively, that the term &quot;murder&quot; was ambiguous. Upon review, the supreme court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because it was not apparent that the legislature unambiguously intended both intentional and unintentional murder to fall within the meaning of the term &quot;murder&quot; in the capital felony statute. The ambiguity of the term was construed in favor of defendant.</SPAN></P>

(2) The trial court did not deny defendant the right to counsel, the conduct of jury voir dire was proper, and the trial court did not err in failing to recuse itself. (3) The bifurcated conviction and sentencing procedures for capital felonies did not violate defendant's right to an impartial jury as guaranteed by the state constitution. (4) Although the trial court improperly instructed the jury concerning the statutory aggravating factor for especially heinous, cruel, or depraved behavior, the error was harmless. (5) Defendant was permitted on remand to challenge the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-100 requiring execution by lethal injection because defendant's sentence was for death by electrocution. And (6) the death sentence imposed on defendant was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

The court next found that Conn. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, and art. I, &sect;&sect; 1 and 20, imposed on the legislature an affirmative constitutional obligation to provide the minority schoolchildren with an educational opportunity substantially equal to that enjoyed by other schoolchildren and that this obligation exceeded any based on the federal constitution. The court found that the initiatives undertaken by the public officials had not eradicated the significant disparities between school districts. The court granted the minority schoolchildren declaratory judgment on their claims but directed the trial court to retain jurisdiction to grant consequential relief, if needed, thus giving the public officials time to fashion their own remedy.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of violating Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278 and Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-277. Defendant appealed, claiming that: (1) the narcotics were seized without a warrant or probable cause; (2) conviction on the two narcotics offenses constituted double jeopardy; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to establish an intent to sell the narcotics. The court affirmed the trial court, finding that: (1) defendant was not seized when he was approached by the officer on the street, and defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the apartment and hence no standing to contest the seizure; (2) the Legislature did not intend to bar multiple punishments for the simultaneous possession of both crack cocaine and heroin; and (3) uncontroverted expert testimony indicated that only a drug dealer would have possessed the quantity, type, and combination of narcotics seized.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer did not appeal that decision, but filed an action alleging the tax assessment was improper because it was unconstitutional, and that the assessment deprived the taxpayer of his due process rights and violated the commerce clause of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. Under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, the taxpayer also sought attorney's fees. The trial court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and the taxpayer sought review.

The court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court held that defendant failed to establish a sufficient foundation from which the trial court could have concluded that there was a reasonable ground to believe that the records would yield evidence useful to the witnesses' impeachment concerning lack of capacity to remember and relate events. The court also held that the trial court's failure to retain the records as a sealed exhibit was improper but concluded that its action was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant accused offender was present inside a residence for which a search warrant had been issued.

He sought suppression, but that motion was denied. He then pled no contest while reserving the right to argue the suppression claim on appeal. He was successful before an intermediate appellate panel, and the prosecution then appealed that ruling. On further review, the court reversed. It held that Conn. Const. art.

Given that in defendant's case the officer who conducted the weapons frisk could determine from his sense of touch that what he felt in defendant's clothing was crack cocaine, the seizure of that substance was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant claimed that certain comments made by the prosecutor during his closing argument to the jury violated his rights under U. S. Const. amend. VI and XIV and under Conn. Const. Art. 1, &sect; 8. Specifically, defendant argued that the prosecutor improperly argued to the jury that the defendant, because he was present in court throughout the trial, was able to tailor his testimony to that of the state's witnesses who in contrast to the defendant, were subject to the trial court's sequestration order. The court determined that the prosecutor's argument invited the jury to draw an inference adverse to defendant solely because he asserted his constitutional right to be present at trial and, consequently, that those comments unreasonably interfered with defendant's free exercise of that right. Furthermore, the court determined that the argument was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and, therefore that defendant was entitled to a new trial on the kidnapping, robbery, and the restraint charges.</SPAN></P>

A few days later, a correctional officer, checking for defendant's presence through the screened window of his cell door, was struck in the face with urine. On appeal, the court held that severance for trial of the two charges was not required where the charges were clearly distinguishable and arose from two discrete incidents, the assault evidence was presented last so as not to inflame the jury on the arson charge, the issues were simple and straightforward, and the trial court instructed the jury not to consider the assault evidence in its deliberations on the arson charge. Defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the uncharged offense of criminal mischief, which was not a lesser included offense of arson. The state could impeach a defense witness about his bias toward corrections officials, and the state's cross-examination of defendant about his prior acts of misconduct did not unduly press the issue once defendant denied the misconduct. Psychiatric evaluation as a condition of probation was not inconsistent with the denial of defendant's motion for a psychiatric evaluation prior to sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The landowner's predecessor-in-interest had acquired from the board a variance, based on a finding of personal hardship, which gave her the right to use her property on a year-round basis for her lifetime. Several years after the landowner acquired title, a zoning enforcement officer ordered him to cease occupying the premises year-round. Pending the owner's appeal of the officer's action, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6(b) was enacted. On appeal, the landowner argued, among other things, that &sect; 8-6(b) was to be applied retroactively and that it required a finding that he was entitled to the benefit of the variance. The court agreed and reversed the trial court's judgment. The court agreed with the trial court that the variance was granted for the life of the predecessor and was, therefore, invalid under the rule that zoning power regulated the use, not the user, of land. Nevertheless, the court determined that the purpose of &sect; 8-6(b) was to validate any variance that ran with the land, despite an invalid and integral condition. Therefore, the court concluded that the illegal condition of the life use was severed from the variance and the variance survived to the benefit of the landowner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case with direction to render judgment sustaining the landowner's appeal in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contention that his testimony in the first trial should have been held inadmissible in the second trial because he had been unconstitutionally compelled to testify in the first trial due to the nondisclosure of the tape recording. The court held that although the trial court erred in excluding certain evidence that a co-defendant had threatened defendant and his family, the error was harmless. The court found that the excluded evidence was only indirectly probative of defendant's defense. The trial court did not err in excluding certain polygraph evidence as unreliable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant, the Connecticut Commissioner of Revenue Services, sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain (Connecticut), which sustained plaintiff taxpayer's appeal from a decision by the commissioner that denied the taxpayer's deduction under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-217(a)(A) from its corporate business taxes for tax interest paid on money borrowed to carry municipal obligations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The taxpayer engaged in the business of buying and selling municipal obligations. The taxpayer included the interest that it received from its inventory of municipal obligations in its gross income and deducted the interest expenses on the indebtedness that it incurred to carry the bonds from its gross income. The commissioner determined that the taxpayer had improperly deducted the interest expenses under Conn. Gen. Stat. 12-217(a)(A) and assessed an additional tax against the taxpayer. The commissioner subsequently denied the taxpayer's request for a correction and the taxpayer sought judicial review in the trial court. The trial court found that &sect; 12-217(a)(A) violated the Equal Protection Clause. The commissioner claimed on appeal that &sect; 12-217(a)(A) did not single out broker-dealers in municipal obligations from broker-dealers in corporate bonds as a particular class to whom differing treatment was afforded. The court agreed with the commissioner's claim. The court found that there were conceivable reasons for the different treatment of corporate and municipal bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the trial court's ruling that sustained the taxpayer's appeal on the ground that Con. Gen. Stat. &sect; 12-217(a)(A) violated the Equal Protection Clause. The Connecticut legislature could conceivably have justified the disallowance of tax deductions for interest expenses incurred in connection with maintaining a municipal bonds when it allowed such deductions for expenses incurred in connection with maintaining corporate bonds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Also, the petition was to address whether the appellate court had improperly concluded that &sect; 26.40a was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the hybrid bobcat. The state supreme court concluded that the list of felidae or cats prohibited by &sect; 26.40a was not exclusive and that &sect; 26.40a was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to all three cats. In order to decide whether &sect; 26.40a was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of the case, the court was first required to consider whether the list of felidae in &sect; 26.40 was exclusive. The court found that the legislature did not intend for the felidae listed in &sect; 26.40a to be the sole felidae the possession of which was prohibited. The list was simply an example of the types of felidae prohibited. The State correctly argued that the term &quot;including&quot; was a term of expansion and that the list served as an example of felidae types. The conclusion was also supported by the doctrine of ejusdem generis and the legislative history of &sect; 26.40a. The court also concluded that bobcats, Bengal cats, and jungle cats were all prohibited by &sect; 26.40a. Possession of purebred and hybrid cats were prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the judgment regarding the bobcat and reversed the judgment regarding the jungle and Bengal cats.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's remaining arguments challenging his sentence: that the prosecutor's penalty phase argument was inflammatory, that the sentence was disproportionate, that there was insufficient evidence to support the aggravating factors found, and that the trial judge had erroneously failed to preclude the death penalty given the evidence, had misinstructed the jury on regarding applicable mitigating factors and the effect of the penalty verdict, and had placed undue pressure on the jurors to reach a death penalty verdict.</SPAN></P>

Because the passenger did not sign a release with her husband driver, or that he was no longer a party, the trial court did not commit error in striking the police officers special defense that the passenger's husband was at fault. The court noted that the police officer could have impleaded the passenger's husband as a third party defendant. The court found that Conn. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiffs, individuals and an assault weapon manufacturer, brought an action against defendant state officials for declaratory judgment challenging the constitutionality of an assault weapons ban, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53-202a through 53-202k. The Superior Court of the District of Litchfield (Connecticut) declared the ban to be constitutional in part and unconstitutional in part. Plaintiffs appealed and the state cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court held that the ban was constitutional but narrowed the statutes by excising certain words from the enumeration of proscribed weapons in order to avoid an unconstitutional vagueness. The court ruled in favor of the state, agreeing that the ban was constitutional but disagreeing that any modification of the ban was necessary. A ban on assault weapons did not infringe on the right to bear arms guaranteed by Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 15 because the ban continued to permit access to a wide array of weapons. Equal protection rights applied only to persons, not weapons. Even if plaintiffs' claims were construed as disparate treatment claims, under the rational basis standard the ban was lawful. As to the weapons manufacturer whose product was specifically proscribed, the ban was not a bill of attainder because it did not inflict punishment without a trial and even if it were so construed, it did not apply only to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group. It applied to all persons who sold that specific weapon. Finally, the ban was not subject to a vagueness challenge in a declaratory judgment setting because it was not vague in all its applications.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment was reversed in part, and the trial court was directed to enter judgment in favor of the state.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In two cases that involved the same property and regulation the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Litchfield (Connecticut) held that the regulation that limited the height of appellee landfill's property was unconstitutional and prohibited appellant enforcement officer's enforcement of the regulation. The trial court also held that state law did not preempt appellant city zoning commission's regulation. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">In the first action, the trial court concluded that the 90-foot height limitation imposed on the landfill by the city zoning commission (commission) constituted an unconstitutional taking of the landfill's property in violation of Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The trial court also concluded that the commission had not waived its opportunity to seek height restrictions by its failure to appeal from the issuance of a permit by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), and the height regulation was not preempted by state law. In the second appeal, which was an enforcement action of the limitation, the trial court refused to grant the enforcement officer's request for injunction relief to cure the landfill's violation of the height limitation. On appeal, the court held that: (1) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-208a(b) was not intended to preempt regulation by the local governing body; (2) the landfill did not prove a nonconforming use with respect to the height limitation; and (3) the limitation was a not an unconstitutional taking of the landfill's property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff unions filed applications against defendant borough, in two cases, to confirm an arbitral award. Party defendant, a receiver, was permitted to intervene. Under the Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA), Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-467 et seq., the receiver challenged the judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut) granting each union's application to confirm the award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Having reached an impasse, binding arbitration was imposed on the unions and the borough, and an arbitration panel was appointed to hear the issues. Having reached complete agreement on the issues during the hearings before the panel, the unions and the borough agreed to waive the provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-473(c) and stipulated to a collective bargaining agreement as the award of the panel of arbitrators. The trial court had denied the receiver's motions to dismiss the applications to confirm prior to the grant of the applications. The court reversed the judgment granting the applications. The court concluded that, when the parties expressly waived their rights under the compulsory arbitration statute, such stipulated awards were properly characterized as collective bargaining agreements, governed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-474, rather than arbitration decisions governed by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7-473c. The awards merely represented the parties' own agreements. Thus, in the absence of compliance with the statutory requirements for an arbitral award, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-417 to consider the applications for confirmation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgments of the trial court and remanded the actions to the trial court with direction to render judgments dismissing the unions' applications.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the mere fact that a child was born while the mother was married was not a per se bar that prevented a man other than her husband from establishing standing to bring an action for a writ of habeas corpus for custody of or visitation with a minor child. The court determined that a putative father of such a child had to offer proof, at a preliminary evidentiary hearing devoted to standing, that he was entitled to set in motion the judicial machinery to determine whether he was the biological father of the child.

The court concluded that the homeless individuals' constitutional claim was controlled by its decision in a companion case which held that the state did not have a constitutional obligation to provide subsistence benefits, including shelter. It concluded that the trial court properly denied the city's request to dismiss its previous order because the 1993 amendments to &sect; 17-273d did not alter the trial court's ability to grant relief for the city's failure to comply with the new statute's mandates.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The claimants brought an action contesting the constitutionality of Conn. Gen.

The claimants argued that this durational limit abrogated the state's affirmative constitutional obligation to provide its indigent citizens with a minimal level of subsistence. The court concluded that the state constitution did not impose an affirmative duty on the state to provide the benefits sought by the claimants. Section 17-273b did not violate Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because the claimants did not prove that an indigent person had a common law cause of action to compel the state, prior to the constitution's passage, to provide a level of minimal subsistence. The claimants also failed to prove that, in implementing Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-273b (1993), the state violated an unenumerated constitutional obligation. The precedents of the court, federal, and sister states did not support the claimants' assertion, nor did the state constitution's text; history; or contemporary economic, sociological, or public policy considerations.</SPAN></P>

The court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183 (j), which characterized any remand order in an administrative appeal as a final judgment, was not applicable because defendant's permit applications were made in 1988, prior to the July 1989 amendments. The court stated that in light of its conclusion that the administrative proceedings are not governed by the amended Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, whether the trial court rendered judgments that were immediately appealable depended upon whether its remand orders satisfied the generic test for a final judgment. The court stated that the remand orders were not ripe for final judicial adjudication because they sought amplification of a ruling that was incomplete.

Upon remand, the matter was transferred to the supreme court for a determination of whether the retroactive policy modifications mandated by 1993 Conn. Acts 93-77 comported with the United States and Connecticut constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Section 3 of 1993 Conn. Acts 93-77 prevented underinsured motorist benefit claims pending at the time of its enactment from being barred from policy limitations periods that were less than three years. The insured argued that her claim, which was brought after a two-year policy limitation period expired, was revived by &sect; 3. The insurer argued that &sect; 3 violated his constitutionally guaranteed contractual and due process rights. The court held that &sect; 3 passed constitutional muster and that the grant of summary judgment to the insurer on grounds that the insured's action was time-barred under the two-year policy limitations period was therefore improper. Section 3 did not effect any extreme contract modification in view of the highly regulated nature of insurance. It was also an appropriate legislative response to mitigate the severe consequences of court holdings that were mandated by clear policy and statutory terms. The contractual interference was therefore justified as a reasonable exercise of the state's police powers. The statute did not contravene any other constitutional provisions because it served a legitimate public purpose and was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The summary judgment granted to the insurer on grounds that the insured's claim for underinsured motorist benefits was time-barred by the policy's two-year limitation period was reversed. The matter was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff junkyard operator challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Hartford (Connecticut), which dismissed its appeal of defendant commissioner of motor vehicles' determination that plaintiff had violated numerous motor vehicle junkyard regulations, and ordered that plaintiff pay civil penalty and that its license to operate a junkyard be suspended for 30 days. Plaintiff argued that it was not collaterally estopped from litigating.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff junkyard operator was found by defendant commissioner of motor vehicles to have violated numerous motor vehicle regulations. Plaintiff appealed, claiming that the decision was arbitrary, unreasonable and an abuse of discretion. Subsequently, an enforcement action was brought to enjoin plaintiff from operating or maintaining a motor vehicle junkyard in violation of motor vehicles regulations. Injunctive relief was ordered and plaintiff appealed but his appeal was dismissed as moot. After plaintiff's appeal from the earlier action had been dismissed, but before judgment had been rendered in the enforcement action, the trial court concluded that the earlier judgment had collateral estoppel effect on the issues raised in administrative appeal and dismissed the appeal. Plaintiff appealed, requesting a new hearing. The court held that the trial court improperly dismissed the appeal on collateral estoppel basis and instead the principles of res judicata were applicable. The court stated that plaintiff's failure to present relevant issues as special defenses in the enforcement action barred him from raising those same issues as affirmative claims in his subsequent appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court affirmed the dismissal on alternative grounds. The court held that the trial court improperly dismissed plaintiff junkyard operator's appeal on basis of collateral estoppel. The court stated that the correct analysis was that the doctrine of res judicata applied on all of plaintiff's claims so that the earlier judgment was valid and enforceable by defendant commissioner of motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Two questions were certified to the court from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. One question asked whether the 30-day time limit for seeking a foreclosure deficiency judgment, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-14, was jurisdictional in nature. The other asked when the 30 days began to run, i.e., whether from the last law day or from the day that title in the foreclosing party became absolute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Debtors obtained a mortgage on a parcel of real estate but defaulted on the debt. The bank that was owed the debt went bankrupt and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) stepped into the bank's shoes and foreclosed on the real estate. The debtors did not attempt to redeem the real estate and consented to a 33-day extension of time following the last law day, after which title would vest in the FDIC. The parties agreed that after the vesting of title, the FDIC would have the 30 days allowed under &sect; 49-14 to file for a deficiency judgment. When the FDIC did so, the debtors claimed that the filing was untimely. The court disagreed, finding that the parties could waive the time limit contained in &sect; 49-14 because the legislature had not indicated that the time limit would deprive a court of subject matter jurisdiction. Instead, the court found that the time limit was mandatory and that compliance was necessary, absent waiver or consent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff company sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Litchfield (Connecticut), which dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction company's action against defendant zoning commission seeking a declaratory judgment to determine whether company's use of its real property for processing earth products was a preexisting nonconforming use not prohibited by Beacon Falls, Conn. Zoning Regs. &sect; 64.10-11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The company, which operated a gravel processing facility, sought a temporary injunction prohibiting the zoning commission from acting on its application to renew its existing special permit pursuant to Beacon Falls, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 64.11.2 and to register its land as a nonconforming use pursuant to Beacon Falls, Conn., Zoning Regs. &sect; 10.6. On review, the court found that the company was required to exhaust its administrative remedies before seeking redress in court because it had an adequate remedy under the regulations. Although the company was not required to seek a special permit because it would not provide an adequate remedy, registering as a nonconforming use would afford the relief sought, namely, recognition of the nonconforming use and the right to continue to process gravel materials without regard to their origin. If the zoning commission denied the company's application to register its nonconforming use, the company could pursue a judicial appeal under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8-8(b), 8-9. The court found no merit to the company's contention that it should be excused from the exhaustion requirement because the commission was not an impartial forum.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 2-1d(a)(2)(C),(E), which prohibited intentional interference with a legislative session by making unreasonable noise or by performing acts which disturbed, disrupted or interfered, were not unconstitutionally vague on their face because they required specific intent to disrupt and because it was not difficult to determine what behavior was unreasonable. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied because the defendant had adequate notice. The court held that the statute was not overbroad in violation of the First Amendment because it did not prohibit the content of speech, only its character as intentionally unreasonable and disruptive. The court held that the gallery of the Hall was a non-public forum which had traditionally allowed limited interaction between the spectators and the legislature. The court held that there was a legitimate interest in prohibiting disruption of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-60(a)(1). Defendant commission made a finding of reasonable cause to believe that plaintiff had committed a discriminatory employment practice. A hearing officer awarded damages to complaint for emotional damages and made an award of attorney fees to complainant's private counsel. The trial court sustained plaintiff's appeal as to the award of attorney fees but dismissed the appeal as to the award for damages for emotional distress. On appeal by plaintiff and defendant, the court held that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 46a-86 did not authorize the award of damages for emotional distress and attorney fees for a violation of &sect; 46a-60(a)(1). The court stated that it was not plausible that the legislature intended the phrase &quot;affirmative action&quot; to include compensatory damages or attorney fees. Defendant had no authority to award compensatory damages under &sect; 46a-86(a). Thus, the court held that the trial court's reliance on defendant's interpretation was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the state argued that petitioner's inability to pay was not ground to release him because he had waived any objection to the extended incarceration when he agreed to the committed fine. The court disagreed and held that petitioner was properly ordered released because the record was void of any indication that he was advised that there was a possibility that his incarceration would be extended in the event that he was unable to pay the fine. Accordingly, the court determined that petitioner could not have waived his objection and his continued incarceration merely because he was unable to pay the fine was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court indicated that it disagreed with the City's contention that the transfer of a worker's case to the second injury fund pursuant to Conn.

The court found that the absence of express statutory authority undermined the argument that the second injury fund was required to assume liability for the injured worker's insurance pursuant to &sect; 31-284b as part of the transfer of liability for compensation under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-349. The court reasoned that the expanded definition of compensation proffered by the City exceeded the legislative intent and would produce an undesired, unanticipated burden on the fund, which was not supported by the legislative history relevant to the enactment of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-284b. The court noted that the payment transfer provisions of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 31-284b(d) were drafted to encompass an employee that was totally incapacitated, in which instance the legislature expressly transferred liability for the worker's benefits to the fund, a provision that was not a substantive change from a prior enactment.</SPAN></P>

The verdict against defendant tortfeasor was reduced pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;52-225a of Tort Reform I, to reflect collateral source benefits received by the executor. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Both parties challenged the trial court's application and interpretation of &sect; 52-225a to calculate the tortfeasor's proportionate share of damages. The tortfeasor alleged that its share of the damages should have been reduced by the collateral sources after the damages attributable to the decedent's contributory negligence were reduced from the total damages. The court noted that &sect; 52-225a provided that net collateral source reduction must be applied to the damages awarded to compensate the claimant. &quot;Award&quot; was defined in terms of the claimant's total loss, as opposed to the liability assessed against any particular defendant. The executor was not entitled to an offset of the collateral source reduction by the attorney's fees he expended in obtaining a settlement with the joint tortfeasors. Although &sect; 52-225a provided for an offset for sums paid by a claimant to secure his right to a collateral source benefit, attorney's fees were not recoverable under common law absent a contractual or statutory exception. Because &sect; 52-225a did not specifically refer to attorney's fees, the court held that such fees were not available as an offset.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judgment of the trial court in favor of the executor was affirmed. The trial court's assessment of damages was also affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that police officer's speech related to a matter of public concern and that it was a substantial factor in causing police chief to take the employment action against him. Further, police officer established a prima facie case that his First Amendment rights were violated. Police chief failed to then establish that he would have taken the same personnel action against police officer in the absence of the protected conduct or that police officer's conduct interfered with the efficient fulfillment of his employer's responsibilities to the public. Therefore, police chief violated clearly established law in retaliating against police officer for his protected conduct. Because police chief could not reasonably believe that his acts were lawful in view of the firmly established law, he was not entitled to qualified immunity against police officer's First Amendment and equal protection claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">After a trial on an information charging defendant with assault on a victim 60 or older in the second degree and interfering with an officer, he was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. He was committed to the jurisdiction of the psychiatric security review board with placement at the Whiting Forensic Institute for a term not to exceed six years. The state's motion to extend defendant's commitment was granted, and his motion to dismiss denied. On appeal, the principal issue was the proper allocation of the burden of proof to determine the continued commitment to a mental hospital of a person previously found not guilty of criminal charges by reason of mental disease or defect. The court concluded that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17a-593(c) impliedly imposed the same burden on the state at a hearing for the continued commitment of an acquittee beyond his current definite period of commitment as was imposed in a civil commitment hearing. That was to show by clear and convincing evidence that the acquittee was currently mentally ill and dangerous to himself or others or gravely disabled.

As a result, the trial court rendered judgment of guilty in each case in accordance with the verdicts and imposed the death penalty on each of the six counts, from which defendant filed three separate appeals. The court affirmed defendant's convictions in their entirety. The court held that even a defendant who has offered no persuasive legal excuse for his felonious conduct was entitled to have a sentencing jury consider extenuating circumstances that may have explained his behavior and mitigated his moral culpability and may therefore have counseled against the ultimate sanction of death.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff landowner appealed an order of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Fairfield (Connecticut), which granted summary judgment to defendants, a city and others, on the landowner's takings action under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 15-73 and 13(b)-43.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The landowner owned real property near an airport. Initially, he built a restaurant on the land. At different times, the landowner also applied for permission from a zoning commission to construct a housing complex and a second floor on his restaurant. The city opposed the landowner's proposed development plans and challenged any zoning commission decisions in his favor. The landowner filed an action against the city, alleging that its opposition was a taking of property under &sect;&sect; 15-73 and 13(b)-43. The lower court disagreed. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's grant of summary judgment to the city, concluding that the landowner did not prove that the city's acquired the functional equivalent of an interest in his property. On the contrary, the city's exercise of its legal rights to appeal zoning decisions did not qualify as takings under the harm tests, which recognized a taking on the grant of permanent injunctive relief to a municipality. Here, the city's appeals did not conclusively determine the rights of the parties as to the land. Thus, the landowner's claim failed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court found that the trial court incorrectly applied the federal objective reasonableness standard to plaintiff public works director's common law malicious prosecution claims. The trial court made no distinction between plaintiff's common law and civil rights claims and concluded that defendant detectives had qualified immunity as a matter of law without reference to any state cases. The court agreed that the exception to qualified immunity permitting a tort action against a municipal employee when the alleged acts involved malice, wantonness, or intent to injure applied. The court held that because the jury found in plaintiff's favor on malicious prosecution, it found that defendants acted with malice, which was sufficient to defeat a qualified immunity defense under common law. The court agreed that the trial court improperly substituted its judgment for the jury's on factual issues. Because the contract in question was not terminated and defendants knew of a prior investigation, the court concluded that defendants lacked probable cause for the arrests. The court rejected reliance on the state's attorney's advice as a defense. The judgment was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the two laws created a presumptively invidious state law classification based on alienage.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The trial court instructed the jury that it could find defendant guilty under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70(a)(1) if it found defendant had compelled the victim to engage in sexual intercourse either by (1) use of force or (2) threat of use of force. The state conceded that the instruction was erroneous because there was no evidence of defendant's threat of use of force but argued that the error was harmless. On reconsideration, the court agreed, reasoning that the error was nonconstitutional in nature because defendant did not establish a violation of his constitutional right to be informed of the charges against him and the inclusion of a factually unsupported theory of liability did not violate defendant's federal due process rights. Defendant failed to demonstrate that the error more probably than not affected the outcome of his trial. There was no indication that defendant's defense of consensual sex would have been different if the reference to threat of use of force had not been included in the instructions. Further, the trial court specifically defined only the actual use of force and the jury could infer threat of force from evidence of defendant's actual use of force.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-92(a)(2)(A), first degree sexual assault in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70(a)(1), and third degree sexual assault in violation of Conn. Gen.

The court held that defendant failed to demonstrate that his claim that the constancy of accusation doctrine was unconstitutional because the doctrine applied equally to male and female victims, was not gender biased and, therefore, did not violate defendant's rights under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The court held that the trial court's jury instructions on both forms of sexual compulsion, even where the State had presented insufficient evidence of one alternative, was not a constitutional violation, but constituted harmless error.</SPAN></P>

The court found the mens rea portion of the statute was not unconstitutional because no one could inadvertently violate the statute - the person would have to intend to do the proscribed conduct. Moreover, the physical violence prohibition in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-182(a)(1) could not be interpreted as unconstitutional. However, in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-182(a)(2), &quot;annoying&quot; and &quot;offensive&quot; conduct was prohibited. Such language was found to be unconstitutionally vague because it could encompass conduct protected by the Free Speech Amendment of the United States Constitution. While the court found the statute unconstitutional as applied to defendant, the court saved the statute by defining those terms. While defendant could not be retried under Conn. Gen.

Rejecting the landowner's claim that his plan constituted a nonconforming use for which a variance was not required, the court noted that a nonconforming use was merely an existing use the continuance of which was authorized by the zoning regulations and ruled that the landowner failed to establish a nonconforming use because the property had been maintained as a vacant lot, not as a year-round dwelling. The court further ruled that the record supported the board's determination that the landowner failed to demonstrate an unusual or unique hardship, and that the board's denial of the variance did not constitute a taking in violation of Conn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff car dealerships reserved questions of law for the advice of the court in an action brought to the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Danbury (Connecticut) for a declaratory judgment to determine the constitutionality of a statute prohibiting the operation of motor vehicle dealerships on Sundays, to enjoin the defendant commissioner of motor vehicles from enforcing that statute, and for other relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The sole issue in this case was whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-301, which prohibited a party engaged in the business of selling motor vehicles from selling them on Sunday, violated the state constitution. Because the court concluded that &sect; 53-301 violated substantive due process under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, the court did not reach the plaintiffs' other state constitutional claims. The court held that because Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-301 merely regulated a commercial activity, the sale of motor vehicles on Sunday, it had to be reviewed in accordance with the rules that normally governed constitutional challenges of economic or social welfare legislation by ascertaining whether the legislature acted arbitrarily or irrationally. The court held that the purpose of these closing laws was to create a common day of rest. The court held that as a Sunday closing law, &sect; 53-301 furthered an objective that was difficult to effectuate with clarity and precision. The court held that in view of the totality of circumstances, the plaintiffs had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that &sect; 53-301 was arbitrary and therefore violated Conn. Const. art.

Pursuant to the continuous treatment doctrine, when the injurious consequences arose form a course of treatment, the limitations period did not commence until its termination. Similarly, the continuing course of conduct doctrine had been applied to toll the statute of limitations when there was an ongoing doctor-patient relationship. Given that the patient's expert testified that the doctor was obligated to pursue follow-up contacts and provide additional diagnostic procedures, those doctrines were applicable and tolled &sect; 52-584. However, the court reversed because the jury instructions misstated the law with respect to the continuing course of conduct doctrine.</SPAN></P>

Respondent State countered these contentions on their merits and also argued that, under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-273, the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the writ of error. The court agreed with the State's jurisdictional claim and dismissed the writ. The court found that &sect; 52-273 provided that no writ of error could be brought for the correction of any error that might have been reviewed by process of appeal. The court held that the legislature could constitutionally limit recourse to a writ of error and that the court's jurisdiction was not impaired by such a limitation of the right to obtain appellate review. Thus, the court held that the &sect; 52-273 exclusion of cases that might have been reviewed by process of appeal was constitutional and that dismissal of petitioner's writ was required.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, although the police had lawful custody under their community care function, chemical analysis of the defendant's clothing constituted an illegal search under the state constitution.

On appeal, defendant argued that certain evidence should have been suppressed, there was no probable cause to prosecute him for murder, and that there was insufficient evidence to convict him. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. First, the court held that defendant was not unlawfully seized by the police and that evidence regarding his evasive statements and behavior during that time was properly admitted. The court held that there was no &quot;seizure,&quot; because a reasonable person would not have believed that he was not free to leave. The court noted that defendant voluntarily went to the police station and once there, the police placed no limitations on defendant's freedom. Next, the court held that there was probable cause to prosecute defendant and there was sufficient evidence to subsequently convict him of murder. Defendant admitted he was present at the time of the assault, he had the victim's blood on his clothing and hands, his testimony contradicted other witness' testimony, and the multiple injuries to the victim showed defendant's intent to murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant attorney appealed the judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), which found the attorney guilty of professional misconduct and suspended the attorney from the practice of law for one year. Plaintiff statewide grievance committee had commenced disciplinary proceedings against the attorney after the attorney refused to attend a pretrial conference in a criminal matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The attorney claimed on appeal that the practice of scheduling mandatory pretrial conferences in criminal matters was unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions, that Conn.

The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment of the trial court suspending the attorney from the practice of law for one year. The court held that the trial court properly found the attorney's repeated refusals to obey trial court orders to appear for pretrial conferences had violated the rules of professional conduct and that the trial court reprimanded the attorney and ordered him to pay two $ 100 fines, which the attorney refused to do for quite some time. The court found that the attorney never claimed that the trial court abused its discretion in making its findings of misconduct and merely claimed affirmative defenses, i.e., that because criminal pretrial conferences were unconstitutional or unjust, his conduct should be excused. As a result, the court did not review the propriety of the trial court's findings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The judge signed an arrest warrant and, sua sponte, added a bond of $ 1000. The warrant charged an individual with littering, which carried a maximum fine of $ 250. The individual was a member of a family who ran a poultry farm which had had a contentious history with a partnership that owned property abutting the farm. Before he ascended to the bench, the judge had been one of three partners in that partnership and had represented its legal interests in proceedings at which the accused litterer had been present. The court dismissed the judge's appeal from his suspension, determining that the action taken by the judicial review council had been proper. The court ruled that the judge's failure to disqualify himself from the matter constituted judicial misconduct that was prejudicial to the impartial and effective administration of justice. The court determined there was clear and convincing evidence to show that when the judge signed the warrant and set bail, he knew or should have known of the history of contentious relations and litigation with the poultry farm and that the littering suspect would have to spend time in jail while arranging bond.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The appellate court found that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that it could find defendant guilty of sexual assault in the first degree if it found that he had compelled sexual intercourse either by the use of force or by the threat of use of force. The State did not introduce evidence of a threat of use of force. The appellate court concluded that the jury was instructed on a statutory alternative for which there was no supporting evidence and ordered a new trial. The court affirmed that the instruction violated defendant's due process rights. A trial court should not submit an issue to the jury that was foreign to the facts in evidence. The text of the sexual assault statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70(a)(1), clearly separated &quot;force&quot; from &quot;threat of use of force&quot; by using the disjunctive &quot;or.&quot; There were two methods of committing the same crime. The State argued that the use of force and the threat of force could not be statutory alternatives because they could occur together and because they caused an identical result, compelled sexual intercourse.

The testimony about the witness' brother exposed her lack of credibility. It was within the trial court's discretion to allow the state to impeach a defense witness with a 1964 felony conviction, and in any case the verdict would not have been different had the jury believed his testimony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Defendant got into a scuffle with a group of individuals.

Defendant claimed at trial that he fired in self-defense. The jury rejected the claim and found defendant guilty on all counts. The court held (1) Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-54a permitted the State to charge a defendant with separate counts of murder, on a theory of transferred intent, for every death resulting from the defendant's conduct where the defendant acted with the intent to kill a person other than the person or persons that were killed, (2) defendant's successful killing of his intended victim did not preclude the State from charging him for the murders of the other victims on a theory of transferred intent, (3) the jury's verdict on the attempted murder and assault in the first degree charges was legally inconsistent, and (4) defendant failed to show that the prosecutor's use of two peremptory challenges to remove African-American venirepersons was race-based.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to suppress based on the illegality of the stop and the warrantless search. The appellate court held that the stop was valid, but that the search was illegal. The court held that the home rule provisions of Conn. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, did not apply to bar the police arrest in the adjoining city because the provisions applied only to legislative actions. The court held that Conn. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 7, 9, which prohibited unreasonable searches and due process violations, did not cover territorial restrictions on police power. The court held that the state's preference for warrants was not overcome because there were no exigent circumstances and because there was ample time to obtain a warrant for the impounded car.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The debtors executed a mortgage to the creditor in order to secure a promissory note. When the debtors defaulted on the mortgage, the creditor sought and obtained a deficiency, and a foreclosure sale. On appeal, the debtors argued that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 49-29, providing for deficiencies, deprived them of procedural due process. Specifically, the debtors argued that they were entitled to a hearing on the fair market value of the property, rather than simply getting credit for the amount of the sale proceeds. The court ruled that the debtors were not entitled to a hearing. The debtors did not have a property interest in having the property's value measured at fair market value. Such a measurement was contrary to an auction sale because there was, by the very nature of the sale, no opportunity for negotiations in an open market. Moreover, the court found that the debtors did not have a right to a hearing on the property's value under Conn. Gen. &sect; 49-14(a). Section 49-14(a) applied only to strict foreclosure proceedings, and not to proceedings for a judgment following a foreclosure by sale.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court improperly refused to allow him to call the first judge to testify at the suppression hearing. The court disagreed. There was no evidence that the two judges discussed the warrant affidavit with each other prior to its issuance. Thus there was no showing by defendant of any misconduct by the first judge. Defendant also sought to call the second judge to question her in connection with her viewing of the photographs. The court held the judge's viewing of the photographs was irrelevant to the propriety of the issuance of the warrant, because the information contained within the four corners of the supporting affidavit was sufficient to allow a finding of probable cause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff complainants appealed a decision of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Stamford-Norfolk (Connecticut) finding that they were prevented from seeking a prejudgment remedy against defendant corporation pursuant to Conn.

The court reversed the lower court's findings that those statutes were unconstitutional because they permitted a prejudgment attachment without requiring an applicant to post a bond or other security. The court noted that all statutes carried a presumption of constitutionality such that in the absence of weighty countervailing circumstances, it was improvident for it to invalidate a statute on its face. Instead, the court opted to find a constitutional construction of the disputed statutes, and so determined that in the absence of statutory limitations preventing it from modifying application for a prejudgment remedy, it was permitted to require whatever forms of security were constitutionally necessary. The court thus found that it could require an attaching party to post security against the risks of attachment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the amended information did not charge the defendant with different or additional offenses that would violate his right to notice under &sect; 624 because the subsections of the statutes in question did not constitute different crimes. The court held that the crimes charged were not different crimes but simply different means of committing the same crime.

The court concluded that the legislature intended that such an adverse determination should not have preclusive effect. The court recognized that the scope of the submission by the parties may have limited the arbitrator's ability to consider all of the relevant legal considerations. Preclusion was not warranted because &sect; 31-290a was a remedial statute that was intended to guarantee the rights afforded to injured employees under the state's workers' compensation laws. Further, the court found standard rules of preclusion were not warranted because reliance on an employee's union to vindicate adequately the employee's statutory rights may not have been justified.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge granted the motion, finding that the affidavit of probable cause contained in the application for the warrant failed to list observations and information supporting the view that there was present probable cause to believe that drugs and drug trafficking evidence would be found inside appellee's residence. Appellant state government took an appeal. After an intermediate appellate panel upheld the trial judge's suppression order, appellant sought and was granted discretionary review. On such review, the court reversed the order and remanded the case for trial at which the evidence seized would be admissible. In so ruling, the court noted that de novo review of the issuing authority's warrant decision was precluded under U.S. Const. amend. IV.

The court disagreed and found that the claim was not barred. The court found that a spouse's claim for loss of consortium was firmly rooted in the common law and that to the extent that the Act abrogated the common law it was to be strictly construed. The court noted that the Act made no explicit mention of whether a loss of consortium claim was barred. Furthermore, the broad definition given to the term claimant as used in the Act could include a spouse asserting a derivative claim of loss of consortium. Finally there was no indication from the legislative history that the Act was intended to apply to a spouse's loss of consortium claim.</SPAN></P>

The developer filed a civil rights action against the town, its zoning commission, and its members. The trial court rendered summary judgment for the defendants, and the developer appealed. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly held that the developer's subdivision application was subject to the commission's discretion and that the town's land use regulations, therefore, did not clearly entitle the developer to approval. The court disagreed with the developer's contention that he met the &quot;clear entitlement&quot; test. The court concluded that the developer failed to establish a protected property interest in subdivision approval, therefore, the developer had not satisfied the threshold requirement of a federal due process claim. The court rejected the developer's two alternative arguments that the Connecticut Constitution ensured such recovery, and that the reasoning of Bivens applied in the state constitutional context. The court found that existing statutory remedies provided sufficient avenues of relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff landowner appealed an order of defendant Commissioner of Environmental Protection (commissioner), which ordered her to eliminate pollution on her property. The Connecticut Superior Court rule in favor of the landowner, finding the commissioner had been incorrect in determining that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22a-432 and 22a-433 imposed liability on the landowner regardless of her innocence in causing the pollution. The commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The main issue on appeal was whether the landowner could be held liable pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-432 to correct a condition on her land that could reasonably be expected to create a source of pollution to the waters of the state, even though she did not create the condition, acquiesce in its creation, or even own the property when the condition was created. The commissioner had decided that the &quot;mere passive ownership&quot; of contaminated real property constituted maintaining a facility or condition which reasonably could be expected to create a source of pollution under &sect; 22a-432. The court held that the legislature intended that the word &quot;maintaining&quot; in &sect; 22a-432, be interpreted liberally to include within its purview a landowner who had failed to abate pollution existing on his or her land that reasonably could be expected to create a source of pollution to the state's waters regardless of blame for the creation of the condition. The court held, therefore, that, pursuant to &sect; 22a-432, the commissioner was empowered to order a cleanup of polluted land without regard to fault or economic hardship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and directed it to dismiss the landowner's appeal from the commissioner's final decision.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the zoning board was required to decide the business's appeal from the decision of the zoning enforcement officer's denial of their building permit before it could act on the business's request for a variance. The zoning board's failure to decide the business's appeal before granting the variance violated Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-6a. The court also held that neither the alleged arbitrariness of the zoning officer's decision, nor the purported uncertainty of the ordinances, constituted the undue hardship necessary to support a variance.

The trial court proceedings were arguable ambiguous about the its response to defendant's motion for a competency hearing. Such ambiguity supported the appellate court's conclusion.

The court held that although the inmate had a right to equal protection of the law that survived imprisonment, the trial court could reasonably have found that Conn. Gen.

Defendant was charged with four counts of criminal contempt under the Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect;&sect; 985, 986(4). The trial court held that the legislature abrogated the judiciary's inherent power to adjudicate a charge of contempt of court for conduct occurring outside the presence of the court. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court had inherent power to act under Conn. Gen. Prac.

In order to bring an action for declaratory relief, the mayor first had to satisfy the provisions of Conn. Gen. Prac. Book R. App. P &sect; 390(d), which provided that a trial court could not render declaratory judgments upon the complaint of any person unless all persons with an interest in the subject matter of the complaint had reasonable notice thereof. The record did not disclose that the required notice had been given. The court rejected the mayor's offer to withdraw his request for declaratory relief regarding the general validity of the ordinance in question as a means to cure the jurisdictional defect, holding that the lack of subject matter jurisdiction could not be cured retrospectively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Plaintiff patient and defendants, a neurosurgeon, a hospital, and a medical school, both sought review of an order by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven (Connecticut), which declared a mistrial on plaintiff's allegation that the neurosurgeon had been negligent in the operation he performed on plaintiff and that the neurosurgeon caused plaintiff serious and permanent injury. The trial court ordered a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The patient contended that the trial court should have granted his motion to accept the jury's verdict and that the trial court should not have ordered a mistrial. The court concluded that there was not any basis for an appeal because the trial court's declaration of a mistrial would have led to a second trial. Thus, there was no final judgment under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-263 because no rights of the parties had been yet determined. The court stated that the parties offered no specific statutory basis, other than the final judgment rule embodied in &sect; 52-263, for an appeal. The court also stated that the trial court's denial of defendants' motions for a directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the failure of the jury to reach a verdict did not provide the basis for an appeal. The court determined that the trial court proceedings produced no more of a final judgment for purposes of an appeal than would have an order, opening a judgment previously rendered, entered upon a motion for a new trial. Given the circumstances of the trial court proceedings, the court held that there was not a final judgment and, accordingly, dismissed both the appeals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c8"><P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c10">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">The court dismissed the appeals filed by both the patient and defendants.</SPAN></P>

The state alleged he also was present and assisted in moving the body. The jury convicted him of felony murder, first degree robbery, and carrying a pistol without a permit. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. There was sufficient evidence to establish defendant's guilt to a reasonable jury. The fact that the evidence had not disproved defendant's story was unpersuasive because the jury plainly concluded that the evidence supported the State's theory of the case. Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the defense of renunciation under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-10 because he failed to raise sufficient evidence of reasonable doubt concerning the existence of the defense. Defendant's alleged walking away was insufficient grounds for renunciation. Renunciation required termination of the effectiveness of any aid provided. Defendant's acts had not ended his accomplice liability under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-8. Defendant's other attacks on the jury instructions were not addressed because on appeal he changed his grounds for objection. The jury instructions taken as a whole were appropriate.</SPAN></P>
