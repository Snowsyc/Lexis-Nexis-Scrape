Appellant contended that the statute was tolled while appellee was on vacation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee motorist was involved in an automobile accident with insured. Appellant insurer filed a complaint against appellee for personal injuries and property damage over two years after the occurrence of the accident. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as being barred by the two year statute of limitations under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10(A). Appellant responded to the motion and argued that for the past five or six years, appellee had vacationed in London, England for five-week intervals and went out of state for dinner every two weeks. The trial court granted appellee's motion, which had been converted to a motion for summary judgment, and dismissed the complaint. Appellant challenged the ruling and contended that the statute was tolled while appellee was on vacation, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.15(A). The court affirmed the trial court and held that the statute could not be tolled unless it was demonstrated that appellee had absconded or concealed himself to avoid service of process. The court held that there was nothing in the record to indicate that appellee had tried to conceal his whereabouts or avoid service.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate appealed from a judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted respondent warden's motion to dismiss a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Petitioner claimed that the trial court abused its discretion and denied petitioner due process of law and equal protection by failing to decide the merits of petitioner's claim that S. 2 (Ohio 1996) required a reduction of his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By a 1989 judgment, petitioner inmate was convicted of a number of crimes and was sentenced to incarceration in respondent warden's correctional institution. Petitioner sought a writ of habeas corpus claiming the enactment of S. 2 (Ohio 1996) (Senate Bill 2) entitled him to a reduction of sentence. The trial court denied the petition on the ground that Senate Bill 2 did not apply to persons convicted prior to July 1, 1996, and further that the refusal of the legislature to provide for retroactive application of Senate Bill 2 did not violate equal protection or due process rights. On appeal petitioner argued that the trial court failed to rule on his argument that Senate Bill 2 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B), read together, were ambiguous and in conflict, and he was denied due process and equal protection rights unless Senate Bill 2 was applied retroactively. The court affirmed the denial of habeas corpus. There was no ambiguity concerning the applicability of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B) to Senate Bill 2, and it was abundantly clear that Senate Bill 2 did not retroactively apply to crimes committed prior to its effective date, and was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment denying petitioner inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus was affirmed. Petitioner's crimes were committed before the statute upon which his claim was based became effective, and the law was clear that the statute did not apply to crimes committed before it became effective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was indicted for felonious assault for knowingly causing or attempting to cause serious physical harm to a child. The court entered judgment accepting appellant's guilty plea to one count of aggravated assault with a specification of physical harm, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2903.12(A)(1) and 2941.143, and appellant was sentenced. Appellant filed a motion with the trial court to harmonize his sentence to conform with the provisions of Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (Ohio 1996). S.B. 2 expressly provided that the amended sentencing provisions did not apply to persons convicted and sentenced prior to July 1, 1996. Appellant committed his crime long before the effective date of S.B. 2. Consequently appellant had to be sentenced in accordance with the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time of his crime. Therefore, this aspect of appellant's first assignment of error was not well-taken. The court also held that appellant failed to preserve an alleged error regarding his allocution right. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's sentencing entry pursuant to a plea agreement in which appellant pled guilty to aggravated assault with a physical harm specification was affirmed because appellant was appropriately sentenced pursuant to the sentencing guidelines in effect when the crime was committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, an inmate who remained incarcerated for a 1981 rape, sought review of the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which adjudicated him to be a sexual predator in 1988. Appellant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C) violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 10 and the Retroactivity Clause of Ohio Const. Art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On February 10, 1981, appellant pleaded guilty to one count of rape in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02. On March 31, 1998, while appellant was still incarcerated, appellant was adjudicated a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09. Appellant argued on appeal that the court below erred in determining that &sect; 2950.09(C) was not impermissibly vague and that it did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause set forth in U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 10, the ban on retroactive law set forth in Ohio Const. Art. II, &sect; 28, the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, or the Double Jeopardy Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V and Ohio Const. Art. I, &sect; 10. The judgment of the court below was affirmed on appeal because the rationale applied by the state's highest court in its determination that Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09(B)(1) violated neither the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution nor the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution also applied to &sect; 2950.09(C). Moreover, the court had previously determined that &sect; 2950.09(C) did not violate Equal Protection or Double Jeopardy clauses of the Ohio or United States constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant was picketing with a sign on a tripod on a sidewalk when he was cited. The defendant argued, inter alia, that Columbus, Ohio, Code 3377.15(d) was unconstitutionally overbroad. The court of appeals agreed, and found that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad. Since the ordinance prohibited essentially all conduct involving a graphic, sign or advertising device on any public right-of-way without limiting the prohibition to situations where the right-of-way was impeded, the ordinance was overbroad. The ordinance did not constitute a reasonable time, place and manner restriction since it was not narrowly tailored to further the state's interest and prohibited constitutionally protected activity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of murder and attempted murder. Appellant argued that he was entitled to be discharged under the speedy trial act, Ohio Rev.

Appellant argued that he was entitled to be discharged under the speedy trial act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.73(B). The judgment was affirmed on appeal. Initially, along with the murder and attempted murder charges, appellant was also being held on a prior unrelated drug charge. Because he was being held in jail upon unrelated charges in two or more criminal cases, the state thought, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.72(A), that the three for one provision of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71(C)(2) did not apply. However, the drug case was eventually dismissed when it was discovered that appellant, who had not been bound over, was a juvenile. The court found that appellant's speedy trial rights were not violated under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.72(D) because the delay was occasioned by appellant's invited error. Moreover, there was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying appellant's motion for a new trial because there was no evidence that appellant had been prevented from having a fair trial.

The only witness at the hearing was the police detective who had investigated the case against defendant. The court ruled that the state made no attempt to carry its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that defendant was a sexual predator. The undisputed evidence was that defendant's conduct was a one-time occurrence involving a single victim, with no cruelty, no pattern of abuse, and no prior sexually-oriented offenses, committed by someone who cooperated and showed remorse during the investigation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order that was entered by the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which denied him relief or a hearing on his post-conviction relief petition, which he filed pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.2. Defendant filed the post-conviction petition in order to challenge his convictions for two counts of aggravated murder with a firearm and mass murder specifications for which he received the death penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot and killed his estranged wife and his brother-in-law. He was initially found not competent to stand trial but, after receiving treatment at a forensic hospital, he was determined to be competent. Defendant contended that &sect; 2953.2 was unconstitutional and that the trial court erred in not granting him an evidentiary hearing. He argued that the affidavits that he attached to his petition provided substantive grounds, on the issue of his competency, which entitled him to at least an evidentiary hearing. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the trial court did not err in summarily dismissing defendant's petition for post-conviction relief without a hearing. The court observed that a criminal defendant who sought to challenge his conviction through a petition for post-conviction relief was not automatically entitled to a hearing. Because post-conviction petitions were quasi-civil, any claim that was or could have been raised at trial or on appeal was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The court found that res judicata barred defendant's claims because the competency issue was fully adjudicated at trial and on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions for two counts of aggravated murder with a firearm and mass murder specifications was affirmed. Defendant's death sentence was also affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Stark County Court of Common Pleas, Ohio, granted summary judgment on behalf of appellee employer. The appeal followed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As a result of an on the job injury, appellant employee filed a complaint for intentional tort against his employer. The complaint was summarily dismissed. On appeal, the employee contended that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2745.01 was unconstitutional and thus the trial court applied the wrong standard in arriving at its decision. The appeals court agreed. By enacting &sect; 2745.01(C)(1), the Ohio General Assembly legislated a clear and convincing standard of proof, in employer intentional tort cases, which conflicted with the summary judgment standard set forth in Ohio R. Civ. P. 56. Therefore, by enacting the statute, the general assembly exceeded the scope of authority granted to it by Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 35. As such, the statute was unconstitutional and void as an improper exercise of legislative power. In deciding whether summary judgment was proper, the court found that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the employer intentionally injured the employee. Thus, summary judgment was error.</SPAN></P>

Defendant specifically argued that the evidence was not clear and convincing because the State presented no expert testimony that would assist the trial court. The appellate court found that the trial court considered reports of two forensic psychologists and the pre-sentence report. One of the psychologists reviewed the factors noted in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2920.09(B)(2). The evidence presented to the trial court was sufficient for it to conclude by clear and convincing evidence that defendant was a sexual predator. Defendant also argued that the sexual predator statute, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950, was unconstitutional. The appellate court overruled this assignment of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Physicians' claims arose out of the merger of several health insurance providers that subsequently terminated physicians from the provider panel of the one provider resulting from the merger. Physicians brought an action alleging unjust enrichment, tortious interference with contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, negligent misrepresentation, and fraud. On appeal, the court held that while Ohio law permitted an employee whose contract of employment was otherwise at-will to sue for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, physicians' contracts were not the type of at-will employment contracts contemplated. The court also held that the at-will termination clause in the contract, unlike a non-compete clause, in no way prohibited physicians from treating certain patients or restricting physicians' ability to practice where and in the manner they wanted. The court also found that there was no violation of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implicit in all contracts, and physicians did not state a claim for tortious interference.</SPAN></P>

I. The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officer's stop of defendant for music coming from his car was based entirely on the officer's own observations, and there was no indication in the record that any other person was annoyed or harassed by the volume of defendant's music. Section 509.11(a) regulated the sound coming from vehicle radios or instruments. The trial court found &sect; 509.11(a) to be unconstitutional because the ordinance allowed for a conviction in the instant case and others like it, where there was no evidence that any member of the community was annoyed by vehicular loud music. The appeals court decided that &sect; 509.11(a) complied with the First Amendment, but addressed, and decided, the case primarily as a question of the limits of municipal authority under Ohio's home rule provisions in Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3. Further Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 715.49(a) permitted municipalities to regulate noise.

The trial court sentenced him to seven to twenty-five years incarceration. Six years later, Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (Ohio 1996) was enacted, which revised the criminal sentencing structure for Ohio. Am. Sub. S.B. 2 applied only to the sentences of persons who committed an offense on or after that date it became effective. Defendant filed a motion for judicial release requesting the trial court to reduce his sentence on the ground that Am. Sub. S.B. 2 altered the term of imprisonment for rape convictions. Defendant also argued that the bill and its amendment violated his constitutional rights. The trial court denied the motion and defendant appealed. The court affirmed because the trial court convicted and sentenced defendant prior to the date the bill became effective; therefore, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B) did not require the trial court to reduce the sentence. Additionally, the bill's sentencing scheme did not apply to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant previously threatened to kill himself, plaintiff, and her children, ransacked her home, and harassed her by phone and mail. The court upheld the civil protection order. First, the Ohio General Assembly intended the version of &sect; 3113.31 as amended by Senate Bill 1 to apply only to acts committed after the statute's effective date. Here, the trial court properly applied the amended version. Second, competent, credible evidence supported the finding that defendant placed plaintiff in reasonable fear of imminent serious physical harm by threat of force. Finally, the federal scheme to regulate interstate traffic in firearms did not displace the state's power to restrict individuals from possessing weapons. Ohio law did not stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress which were reflected in the Gun Control Act. Thus, the trial court only had to comply with &sect; 3113.31 and determine that defendant committed domestic violence and that enjoining him from possessing firearms was fair and equitable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested on several felony charges. His case was transferred to an adult court. Defendant asserted that the mandatory bindover provision in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.26 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that defendant failed to overcome the presumption that &sect; 2151.26 was constitutional. The court stated that &sect; 2151.26 was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided adequate notice of what fell under its scope. The court noted that the right to an amenability determination was not fundamental and the factors used to determine whether a juvenile was amenable to treatment were rationally related to the purpose of deterring violent crime. The court determined that &sect; 2151.26 did not violate defendant's right to bear arms because the right was subject to reasonable regulation by the State. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 2151.26 was an equal protection violation because the decision to treat juvenile gun offenders differently than other offenders was rationally related to the interest of deterring violent crime. The court concluded that there was no separation of powers violation because the juvenile court was statutorily created.</SPAN></P>

His contentions were rejected. The appellate court concluded: (1) the bill of particulars provided by the State complied with the requirements of law; (2) dismissal of the cause of action brought under Ohio Rev.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court decision. The court found that the statement made by a witness to the prosecutor or his agent prior to trial qualified as a statement subject to court inspection under Ohio R. Crim. P. 16(B)(1)(g). Such a statement, even though it was the work product of the prosecution, was not entirely protected from defense inspection in cases where the defense made a request pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 16(B)(1)(g). Thus, the trial court erred in not performing an in camera inspection of the recorded statement of the witness and in not providing defense counsel the opportunity to participate in the review of the statement. However, the court reviewed the statement and found no inconsistencies. The court concluded that the failure of the trial court to inspect the statement or to permit counsel to inspect the statement was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also found sufficient evidence to support the charge and conviction of aggravated burglary and rape as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action. The employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 4123.512 provided that the claimant/employee or the employer could appeal an industrial commission order to the court of common pleas of the county in which the injury was inflicted. The employee argued that the statute was not applicable to his claim because he was not attempting to appeal the commission's order, but was seeking monetary relief against state agencies. The employee's attempt to title the action as a claim to avoid the statute was futile. The employee argued several constitutional claims which could not be raised for the first time on appeal. The employee argued that the commission committed error by approving his settlement within two days, because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.65 provided for a 30-day cooling-off period. However, the version of the statute which was in effect at the time of settlement did not contain a cooling-off period. The court of claims properly ruled that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the employee's claim as it was a claim disputing the validity of a settlement of a worker's compensation claim, and as such, should have been appealed to a common pleas court pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.512.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested and charged with burglary. The indictment stated that defendant did by force, stealth, or deception, trespass in an occupied structure or in a separately secured or separately occupied portion thereof, namely, a particular residence, with the purpose to commit a theft offense or any felony. At a plea hearing, the State recited facts giving rise to defendant's plea. However, the recited facts failed to show defendant committed a trespass, a material element of the burglary crime. Nevertheless, the plea was accepted and the trial court sentenced defendant. After judgment was entered, the appellate court found defendant's guilty plea could be accepted under existing law despite the fact the State did not recite facts regarding the trespass element. It found the facts recited did not absolutely negate that element. It further found that the totality of the circumstances warranted a finding that defendant understood the charges against him. Finally, it held that defendant was properly sentenced as the manner in which he was sentenced violated neither his due process nor equal protection rights under either the United States or Ohio constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings on the basis of prejudicial error and a violation of due process. The court stated that the record failed to indicate that defendant was ever notified of his sexual predator hearing or its subject matter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted on one count of rape pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(2) and one count of sexual battery pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.03(A)(2). The Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) acquitted defendant of rape, but found him guilty of sexual battery. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a night of heavy drinking, the victim fell asleep in defendant's home. When the victim's friends returned, she told them she wanted to leave. In the car, she became extremely upset and told her friend that defendant had raped her. Defendant gave a taped statement to police and admitted having sex with the victim, but claimed that it was consensual. Defendant argued it was error to allow into evidence his taped statement, and the statements of the victim made to her friends, to police and medical personnel that she had been raped. The court ruled defendant was not prejudiced in any way, by the admission of the tape. The evidence showed that the victim did not want to be touch by anyone and that she was extremely reluctant to be around men. She was so agitated that she could not talk to police at the hospital, and had to be briefly placed in the psychiatric unit. The court ruled that the finding of excited utterances was reasonable, and State presented substantial evidence from which a jury could reasonably find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant engaged in sexual conduct with the victim, knowing she was substantially impaired by alcohol.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty by a jury in the Greene County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder, attempted complicity to commit aggravated murder, and attempted complicity to commit felonious assault. He was sentenced to incarceration. He appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal from his convictions, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the legislation that amended the statutory definition of aggravated murder to encompass the unlawful termination of another's pregnancy and added new definitions to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.09. He claimed that the law was &quot;ambiguous, vague, and overbroad&quot; on its face and that, as applied to him, it violated his rights to due process, effective assistance of counsel, freedom from cruel and unusual punishment, and equal protection of the law. The appellate court rejected these claims. Overbreadth claims related only to First Amendment issues where it was feared that an overly broad statute could have a chilling effect on free speech. Defendant's case did not implicate free speech. However, the trial court did commit error by failing to merge the offenses of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder and attempted complicity to commit aggravated murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injury victim filed a damage action against the manufacturer, alleging that as a result of his exposure to asbestos-containing products, he developed asbestosis. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the injury victim, awarding compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court granted the manufacturer's motion for a directed verdict, holding that the punitive damage award was precluded by &sect; 2315.21(D)(3)(a). On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that &sect; 2315.21(D)(3)(a) effectively abrogated the common law right to have a jury assess the amount of punitive damages. Accordingly, &sect; 2315.21(D)(3)(a) was unconstitutional because it impinged upon the injury victim's right to a trial by jury as provided in Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 5. Further, the injury victim's due process rights to a remedy and to open courts under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16, as well as his right to equal protection under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2, were violated without a showing of sufficient evidence to demonstrate a compelling state interest justifying such impingement. Finally, even if &sect; 2315.21(D)(3)(a) was constitutional, it could not be applied retroactively because it affected a substantive right.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the Board's decision which imposed a psychiatric treatment condition upon the physician as a condition of probation. The court reasoned that the Board could not require psychiatric treatment as a condition of probation when it had not charged the physician with being mentally impaired. The court further reasoned that although the physician had some prior history of mental and/or cognitive difficulty, the record did not disclose the precise nature or extent of the past condition, or whether or not the physician still suffered from that condition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The opponents challenged the decision by the Board of Commissioners to vacate a township road. The evidence revealed that the road had been abandoned for over 40 years. The evidence further revealed that the road had not been used for any purpose for many decades. The trial court reviewed the decision and found that it was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable; and there was ample evidence in the record to support the decision. The opponents appealed. The court held that the Board of Commissioners' decision to vacate was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The court also found ample evidence to conclude that the trial court's judgment was supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence. The trial court's decision: (1) fully and accurately reflected its standard of review; and (2) discussed the relevant evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurer challenged the decision of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that assessed damages against it and another insurance company in the amount of $ 1,500,000. Appellees, an insured's family, sought underinsured motorist coverage after an automobile accident in which their decedent was ejected from a car. The insurer did not timely answer the complaint and the trial court granted the family's motion for default judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On the insurer's appeal from the default judgment and assessment of damages against it, the court held that the insurer's reason for failing to file a timely answer did not establish excusable neglect, nor did it rise to the level of a &quot;unique&quot; or &quot;extraordinary circumstance.&quot; Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it overruled the insurer's motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B)(1). The court held that a second motion filed by the insurer, which sought relief under Ohio R. Civ. P. 60(B)(1), (5), was barred by the doctrine of res judicata. The insurer failed to demonstrate that the arguments contained in its second motion for relief from judgment could not have been raised in the first motion for relief from judgment. The court also ruled that the trial court erred when it entered default judgment in the declaratory judgment action, for it lacked jurisdiction because of the insured's family's failure to serve the Ohio Attorney General as required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12. In addition, the court held that the damage award was excessive. The trial court was limited to awarding damages within the insurer's policy limits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment in favor of the insured's family in their action seeking underinsured motorist coverage was affirmed in part and reversed in part.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of sexually abusing four children on several occasions. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. On appeal, defendant asserted the trial court erred in overruling his motion to sever the case into four separate trials. The court held that because these offenses were of the same or similar character, they were properly joined. Defendant urged that he was denied his right to due process of law because of prosecutorial misconduct. The court found that the State's characterization of defendant's doctor's testimony as &quot;silly excuses&quot; was within the scope of final argument. The State exceeded the bounds of proper closing argument by suggesting that there could be more victims. The court concluded, however, that defendant failed to demonstrate how this misconduct prejudicially affected his substantial rights. The court also determined that defendant was not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel, the verdict was not against the manifest weight and sufficiency of the evidence, and the Sex Offender Registration Act, as applied to conduct prior to the effective date of the statute, did not violate the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, homebuilder association and corporation, sought review of a judgment of an Ohio trial court that was entered against it on its action to challenge an impact fee ordinance enacted by appellee city. Appellants contended that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it concluded that the impact fee enacted by appellee did not violate the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Ohio and United States constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, homebuilder association and corporation, challenged the constitutionality of an impact fee ordinance that was enacted by appellee city. The trial court ruled against appellants on their cause. On appeal, they contended that the trial court erred when it determined that the impact fee complied with the equal protection and due process guarantees of federal and state constitutions. The court found that the impact fee ordinance operated as a tax rather than a fee. For the tax to be constitutional under relevant Ohio authority, appellee had to provide matching funds to ensure that new development was not being charged disproportionately for a road system that benefited both the general public and appellants' new residential development. The court in turn determined that appellee's provision of credits for other funding did not satisfy that obligation. Appellants' constitutional challenge to the ordinance was thus sustained, and the trial court's judgment was reversed and remanded. Although, the resolution of appellants' first claimed error disposed of the case, the court proceeded to address the appropriate legal standards for review of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court that was entered against appellants, homebuilder association and corporation, was reversed and the matter remanded for further consistent proceedings. Appellee city's impact fee violated appellants' equal protection and due process rights, as it operated as a tax rather than a fee, and charged appellants disproportionately for a road system that benefited both the general public and association.</SPAN></P>

The trial court imposed two consecutive five-year terms of incarceration with two consecutive five-year terms of post-release supervision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent sustained fatal injuries while riding as a passenger in a vehicle driven by the tortfeasor. The decedent's family was insured under two policies issued by the insurer, which included uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. The administrator settled with the tortfeasor's insurance carrier for an amount that exceeded the per-person limits under appellants' policies. When the insurer denied appellants' claims, they filed an action for a declaratory judgment and to recover uninsured/underinsured motorist benefits. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court granted summary judgment to the insurer and denied summary judgment to appellants. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court ruled that neither Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18(H) nor Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.44, which permitted liability limitation provisions in insurance polices, violated Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 19a because they did not limit the damages recoverable against tortfeasors in wrongful death actions.

Following a police chase that ended with a shoot out, appellant was apprehended and taken to the police station where appellant made various statements to the police.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following a murder conviction and death sentence, appellant sought review. In affirming, the court held statements to police were admissible because appellant's statements and waiver of Miranda warnings was voluntary. Additionally, the court held the warnings were properly given, notwithstanding a partial re-warning, because the re-warning had been proximate in time to the original warning. Furthermore, the court held appellant had not requested counsel during interrogation because appellant only requested an attorney in order to strike a bargain. The court also held that because a claim of accidental death was contradicted by a witness, coroner, and forensic experts, sufficient evidence supported the conviction and thus, an acquittal was not required under Ohio R. Crim. P. 29(a). Moreover, even though a comment on appellant's request for an attorney could have affected whether jurors' reasonable doubt, the court held the comment was harmless because appellant would not have been convicted but for the comment. Finally, the court held counsel's decision to call witnesses and to not request the pre-sentence report had gone to trial strategy, and thus, counsel was not ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Court affirmed a judgment convicting appellant of murder and sentencing appellant to death because the police had properly given Miranda warnings, and appellant had voluntarily waived Miranda rights, had voluntarily made statements, and had failed to properly request an attorney during interrogation.

The corporation cross-appealed the trial court's decision declaring Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2745.01&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent died as a result of crushing injuries sustained while he was filling bags of fertilizer within the scope of his employment. At the time of the accident, a hopper was loaded with approximately three tons of fertilizer suspended over decedent. The corporation's employee designed, constructed, and installed the hopper. The issue on appeal was whether there was sufficient evidence in the record of whether the fatal injuries were a proximate result of the corporation's common law intentional tort. The trial court found the administratrix must have shown the corporation had knowledge the fertilizer dust could have diffused through the cracks in the wood and come in contact with steel nails holding the hopper together. The appellate court disagreed, finding there was sufficient evidence of the corrosive effect of the fertilizer on the hopper such that reasonable minds could have drawn different inferences from the undisputed facts. Because reasonable minds could have differed regarding whether the corporation knew there was a substantial certainty one of its employees would be injured, the trial court's entry of summary judgment in favor of the corporation was error.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court committed reversible error when it failed to provide defendant with counsel and failed to allow him to confront witnesses or submit evidence. The court agreed and reversed. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09 required the trial court to inform defendant that he had a right to counsel and to provide him with a meaningful opportunity to contest the sexual predator classification request. The trial court erred because it did not inform defendant at the hearing that he had the right to testify, present evidence, call and examine witnesses, cross-examine witnesses, be represented by counsel. The court held that the law could be applied retroactively and did not violate the federal constitution's ex post facto clause nor Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28.</SPAN></P>

The defendant then filed a motion to dismiss an Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09, proceeding against him to determine whether he was a sexual predator. He argued that &sect; 2950.09, was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated the United States Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause and the Ohio Constitution's retroactivity clause. The trial court found that the defendant had been convicted of sexual battery, he had committed other sexually oriented offenses on his two daughters, and he had fathered two children by a daughter. The trial court subsequently adjudicated the defendant as a sexual predator. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that &sect; 2950.09, did not violate the United States Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause or Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, because it was not retroactive, as it merely drew upon antecedent criminal conduct to identify potential sexual predators.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, the court held that the &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; standard was not required to classify an offender as a sexual predator and thus, that there was no due process violation. The court also held that the statute did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, as alleged by defendant, because it was not a punitive statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company sought an exemption to build a telecommunications tower on a 35 acre farm, but the farm was in fact zoned for five acre residential tracts by the township. The company contended the trial court erred by determining that the phrase &quot;zoned for residential use,&quot; as set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.211(B), included any zoning district that did not prohibit residential use. The company also claimed that the trial court erred by failing to find that the township zoning resolution specifically exempted it from complying with the township's zoning rules. The appellate court concluded that the plain language of the statute permitted regulation in areas that were zoned for residential use or did not prohibit residential use. Because the zoning scheme provided for one-family dwellings on five acre lots on the subject farm, the township had authority to regulate that area under residential uses even though it was also zoned as an agricultural district. Moreover, the appellate court found that Beavercreek Township, Ohio, Zoning Resolution &sect; 18.08 which permitted essential services in any district did not exempt the company from complying with applicable zoning regulations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with violating city ordinances for failing to stop for a red light, and playing his stereo too loudly. The offenses occurred on separate dates. At trial, appellant moved to dismiss the stop-light violation pursuant to the speedy trial statute. The Portage County Municipal Court (Ohio) overruled the motion, and defendant was convicted on both charges. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On August 7, 1997, defendant was cited for the stop-light violation but the prosecutor continued the September 4, 1997, trial date. On September 7, 1997, defendant was cited for playing his stereo too loudly. Subsequently, defendant moved to combine the matters for trial. Then, on the date of trial defendant moved to dismiss the stop-light violation. The appellate court found the trial court failed to enter an order addressing the continuance within the statutory time limit. It also failed to indicate the underlying reasons necessitating the continuance. Moreover, there was no evidence in the record to justify the trial court's determination. Thus, the delay was charged against the state and the stop-light violation should have been dismissed as beyond the 30 day speedy trial limit. Defendant also argued the ordinance governing loud stereos was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. However, the appellate court found the scope of the statute was not overbroad in that it prohibited such noise beyond a distance of 30 feet. Moreover, an officer testified he could hear the noise well beyond 30 feet. Thus, it was unnecessary to examine the ordinance's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a group of city residents, taxpayers, and landowners, sought review of a judgment from the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which determined that appellee city's ordinances approving private property development by appellee corporate developers were valid, except for provisions that irrevocably pledged tax revenues as securities for the developers' notes and bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The group challenged the validity of five city ordinances allowing the developers to implement their development plan on approximately 100 single-family residence-zoned acres that the developers owned in the city. The court made the following holdings on the group's appeal. 1) The ordinance granting a loan of public funds to the developers' project was not unconstitutional because the project fell under the Ohio Const. art. VIII, &sect; 13, exception for an &quot;improvement of property&quot; that was &quot;beneficial&quot; to industry and commerce. 2) The city's council and planning commission did not have authority under the city's ordinances to grant the three variance ordinances because that authority was delegated to the city's board of zoning appeals. 3) Even if the board of zoning appeals had granted the variance ordinances, they would have been invalid because such sweeping zoning changes could only legally be achieved through an amendment to the city's zoning ordinances. 4) The ordinance that vacated the duly-dedicated status of a certain city street was not unconstitutional as a legislative act because the city council could have concluded that the legislation was beneficial to the city.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment as to the general validity of the ordinance granting the loan, but remanded for the trial court to address arguments of the group that it had not initially considered.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was placed on community control for a period of four years, with certain enumerated conditions. On October 29, 1997, the trial court again revoked appellant's community control, as a result of appellant's conduct. The trial court thereafter modified its original sentence and ordered that appellant serve a 15-month term of imprisonment with credit for time served. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.11 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.28 on various constitutional grounds. The appellate court concluded that the judgment at issue on appeal did not contain any express terms subjecting defendant to the bad time provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.11 or post-release control provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.28. It merely reinstated and modified the original sentence imposed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence for aggravated murder. Appellant filed a petition requesting post-conviction relief. The Common Pleas Court of Cuyahoga County (Ohio) granted the state's motion to dismiss appellant's petition, ordered the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and subsequently denied appellant's petition without hearing. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's primary argument was that his trial counsel was ineffective in the mitigation phase of his trial by failing to introduce a psychiatrist's report which indicated appellant had a personality disorder an evidence of appellant's good behavior during his incarceration. The appellate court noted a behavior disorder did not qualify as a mental disease or defect so as to negate an intent element. Moreover, personality disorders were not considered substantial mitigating factors as many criminals had personality disorders. In addition, evidence of appellant's traumatic family life did not demonstrate a theory of mitigation. Consequently, the counsel's failure to put forth such evidence would not have altered the outcome of appellant's sentence and therefore counsel was not ineffective. Appellant also claimed prejudice because the jury was permitted to weigh the aggravated circumstance of attempted rape, a charge which was later vacated. However, that issue had been raised on direct appeal and the application of res judicata was properly applied. Finally, appellant was not entitled to conduct discovery under the rules of civil procedure in a post-conviction relief proceeding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the lower court denying defendant's petition for post-conviction relief without a hearing was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city challenged the decision of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which modified the real property tax assessment on two parcels owned by appellee landowner; enjoined the city from proportionately assessing the two parcels in connection with the construction of a water line running along the parcels' frontage; and taxed costs of the administrative appeal to the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city charged the landowner special assessments to finance construction of a water line along the property. The landowner filed an appeal seeking to have the special assessment against her property overturned. The trial court modified the assessment by greatly reducing it, and the court affirmed on appeal by the city. The court held that, contrary to the city's claim, the trial court did not base its decision &quot;solely&quot; on whether the water line construction special benefits increased the fair market value of the property. The amount was based upon unrebutted expert opinion as to the benefit that each lot would enjoy. The trial court's reliance on the landowner's expert report was proper in fulfilling the trial court's mandate of weighing the evidence in the record. The court rejected the city's claim that the well water supplying the property was substandard. The only testimony on the subject was from the landowner, who said that the well water was adequate. Accordingly, the trial court's findings and conclusions relative to the quality of the well water servicing the land referred to in the landowner's expert report was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the provisions of Ohio Rev.

Defendant's constitutional challenge was based upon the Ex Post Facto Clause found in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. The court of appeals held that it had previously rejected these challenges, and saw no reason to revisit the issues. Defendant also contended that the trial court's decision was based on impermissible hearsay, namely, the trial court's consideration of the psychological report of a doctor who did not testify. The court of appeals held that the trial court made it clear that if defendant wished to cross-examine the author of the report, the trial court would arrange a continuation of the hearing so that he could do so. Defendant's counsel represented to the trial court that, after conferring with his client, it had been decided not to subpoena the doctor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">First, the appellate court held that because the sexual predator law was not unconstitutional, the prosecutor did not engage in misconduct by attempting to classify defendant as a sexual predator. The sexual predator act did not violate either the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution or the retroactivity provisions of the Ohio Constitution for a number of reasons, such as the statute's nonpunitive goal to alert the community to the presence of dangerous sexual offenders adjudged likely to offend again. Second, defendant contended that his attorney acted deficiently in failing to raise the constitutional arguments addressed in the brief. However, because the arguments were without merit, defendant failed to demonstrate that the outcome of his sexual predator hearing would have been different had his defense counsel raised them. Thus, defendant failed to show that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to attempted gross sexual imposition, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2923.02, 2907.05(A)(1). The Greene County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) imposed sentence which included a treatment program for sex offenders. Defendant appealed from his conviction and sentence, challenging the trial court's denial of his motion to declare Ohio's Sexual Predator Act (Act), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01 et seq., unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated. As a sexually oriented offender who had not been classified as a habitual sex offender or a sexual predator, the community notifications provisions of the Act did not apply to defendant. The requirements apply only to information concerning sexual predators and habitual sex offenders, not to a &quot;sexually-oriented offender&quot; such as defendant. Indeed, access to the registration information was strictly limited by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.18, which greatly diminished defendant's claim that his privacy was violated. Given the existing data demonstrating a high rate of recidivism among sex offenders, it was clearly conceivable that the registration and notification provisions in the Act rationally furthered the legislature's stated goal of protecting the public. Thus, there was no equal protection violation stemming from the registration and notification requirements. Further, the registration requirements did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that defendant was convicted under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A). Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.13(F) prohibited a sentencing court from reducing the term of a sentence it imposed for a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2925.03(A). Under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.191, however, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction reduced the sentences based upon time served.

The vehicle's owner was underinsured. The deceased's parents were divorced and she resided principally with her mother. Her father's insurance policy defined &quot;insured&quot; as the policyholder and any &quot;family member&quot; that lived at the location shown in the policy. The trial court granted the insurance company's summary judgment motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. The administrator argued that the denial of the coverage violated the spirit of Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 3937.18, which deemed the father as the one who was presumed to have suffered damages by reason of his daughter's wrongful death. The administrator argued that the statute was unconstitutional as it violated the Equal Protection Clause, the constitutional prohibition against limiting tort damages, and abrogated the right to remedy found in Ohio Const. art. , &sect; 16. On appeal, the court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that the decedent was not an insured under the policy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A consent decree between the historic district commission and the City of Toledo prohibited the city from permitting environmental changes to property within the historic district unless a certificate of appropriateness had been previously issued. Toledo, Ohio Municipal Code &sect; 1153.07(j) prohibited a city official from approving a retroactive amendment to a certificate of appropriateness when the amendment had not been approved by the historic district. The resident argued that it was error to hold that &sect; 1153.07(j) permitted the historic district commission to retroactively approve an amendment to a previously issued certificate of appropriateness. The court agreed and reversed the judgment. The court opined that reading the consent decree in conjunction with &sect; 1153.07(j) required the conclusion that retroactive amendments to certificates of appropriateness requested after the environmental change had been initiated were not permitted. The court explained that when a municipality was a party to an action under which it had been ordered to abide by an order granting injunctive relief, the municipality could not legislatively override its obligation under the order.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also alleged that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his counsel also represented the co-defendant. On appeal, the court found that defendant was not prejudiced or prevented from having a fair trial. The court stated that the trial court correctly compelled the co-defendant to testify because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.44 authorized such action against a witness who was provided immunity for turning state's evidence. The court disregarded defendant's complaint regarding the lack of notice as to the co-defendant's testimony because the issue was not preserved for appeal and the issue did not rise to the level of plain error. The court determined that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel based on the multiple representation because the trial court had no reason to inquire into the propriety of the representation, and defendant did not show how the multiple representation could have prejudiced him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The executrix's husband had named his sister as beneficiary on his IRA upon his death.

Code Ann. &sect; 1709.01 et seq., to an IRA agreement, which was established before the enactment of &sect; 1709.01 et seq. and designated a beneficiary to which the IRA was payable upon the death of the account holder, violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. The executrix alleged that the IRA did not conform to Ohio's statute of wills, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2107.03, and was unenforceable. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment against the executrix, noting that the husband had a federal statutory right to designate anyone as the beneficiary of his IRA under 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 408. Further, the court concluded that &sect; 408 clearly conflicted with Ohio's statute of wills and that federal law controlled under the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The instructors provided remedial reading services for students attending a nonpublic school. The district paid the instructors directly during the years they taught at the school, using state funds allocated to the district under &sect; 3317.024(P). Because the district did not view the instructors as employees, it did not submit employer or employee contributions to the STRB on their behalf. After inquiry by the instructors, the STRB brought a declaratory judgment action naming the district and instructors as defendants, seeking a writ of mandamus and a determination that the district was bound by Ohio Rev.

After a jury trial, defendant was convicted on charges of kidnapping, attempted rape, complicity to rape, complicity to assault, and assault, and he was adjudicated as a sexually-oriented offender.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction for harassment by an inmate. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to continue the trial date based upon defendant's exercise of his religious rights. The court held that since defendant failed to put forth any evidence which demonstrated the sincerity of his religious beliefs nor did he provide the trial court with evidence pertaining to his religious practices, the trial court's decision was not violative of the Ohio Constitution nor the United States Constitution. Defendant also challenged the trial court's failure to respond to the jury's request to have certain testimony read back to it. The court held that defendant waived the right to appeal this matter as he did not call the alleged error to the trial court's attention. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed from a judgment of the Ross County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which found that Ohio's sexual predator statutes,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2950.01 - 2950.09, were unconstitutional as applied to persons convicted of crimes prior to the effective date of the act. The trial court determined that the sexual predator statutes did not constitutionally apply to defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court had held that the sexual predator statutes violated the Ex Post Facto Clause and the Ohio Constitution's prohibition against retroactive laws when applied to persons who committed crimes prior to the effective date of the act. Because defendants were convicted of sexual offenses prior to the effective date of the act, the trial court determined that the statute's could not constitutionally have been applied to defendants, and it refused to impose registration and notification requirements upon them. The court reversed the judgment and held that the sexual predator statutes were remedial in nature and, thus, did not violate the constitutional prohibition against retroactive laws. The constitution prohibited the general assembly from enacting retroactive laws which were substantive in nature, not retroactive laws that were remedial in nature.Although prior criminal conduct triggered the sexual predator proceedings, prior criminal conduct was not the focal point of the proceedings. Rather, in determining whether to have adjudicated a prior offender as a sexual predator, the focus was exclusively upon the likelihood of future conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's ruling that the state's sexual predator laws were unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee and his wife sued defendant employer for serious burns he sustained during his employment. The plaintiffs alleged an intentional tort. The trial court (Ohio) judgment relied on Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2745.01 and dismissed the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 2745.01 had been held unconstitutional. Plaintiffs, therefore, had to meet the heightened pleading requirement to be able to sustain their employer intentional tort claim. Under this standard, plaintiffs had to prove with particularity that the employer either specifically desired to injure the employee or knew that an injury to the employee was certain or substantially certain to result from the employer's act and, despite this knowledge, still proceeded. Plaintiffs alleged that the employer intentionally removed a guardrail from the hot-water tank and that another employee had fallen into the tank when the guardrail was not utilized. Plaintiffs alleged the employer knew that requiring him to work without proper safety equipment or guarding of the hot-water tank was certain or substantially certain to cause severe injury and possible death. Plaintiffs' claim for an employer intentional tort was viable under these allegations, because the employee could potentially show that his injuries were substantially certain to result from the removal of the guardrail.</SPAN></P>

She also challenged the denial of her motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted the trial court erred by denying her motion to suppress the physical evidence found in trash bags removed from her hotel room which was part of the grounds for a search warrant for her room. The appellate court held the search was proper. In addition, the evidence did not show the jury clearly lost its way or that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The jury was entitled to reject defendant's defense that there was not adequate evidence adduced to establish that she was involved in corrupt activity, the basis of the RICO charge. The State presented eyewitness testimony that she made several wire transactions transferring money derived from illegal drug sales. She made statements that she was involved in a group that she knew to be engaged in an illegal enterprise selling drugs. The evidence was such that reasonable minds could have concluded that she engaged in a pattern of corrupt activity by violating the money-laundering statutes. The prosecutor did not commit misconduct since background information was admissible. The money laundering statute was not vague. The jury instructions were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled guilty to theft in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.02. The Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) notified defendant that &quot;bad time&quot; could be imposed by the parole board pursuant to Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2967.11, 2967.28, were unconstitutional, invoking various constitutional grounds, including the right to a trial by jury, the right to counsel, separation of powers, double jeopardy, equal protection, and procedural and substantive due process of law. Defendant not allege and the record did not reflect that he had been subjected to the actual imposition of either bad time or post-release control. Rather, he brought the appeal based on the fact that he might be so subjected at some indeterminate point in the future. The appellate court held that under these circumstances, it had previously held that a convicted defendant lacked standing to bring a constitutional challenge to Ohio Rev.

The record did not reveal whether the parole board had imposed either bad time or post-release control upon defendant by the time of his appeal. The appellate court held that, since there was no evidence that defendant had yet suffered the actual imposition of additional time in prison or post-release control pursuant to the two statutes in question, he had no standing to challenge their constitutionality in his appeal. The appellate court emphasized, however, that its ruling did not bar defendant from prospectively again raising the constitutionality of the bad time provision or the post-release control concept of the statutes under a proper factual predicate.</SPAN></P>

The Ohio General Assembly did not violate the separation of powers doctrine when it established the mandatory prison term set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.08 and the provisions of &sect; 2903.08 were consistent with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.191. The removal of drunk drivers from the road who caused serious physical injury bore a real and substantial relationship to the public's safety and general welfare. Consequently, &sect; 2903.08 did not violate substantive due process. Defendant failed to demonstrate how he was denied procedural due process in the trial court's acceptance of his no contest plea or at any other phase of his sentencing in the matter. According to the record, defendant had yet to have his sentence extended for &quot;bad time&quot; pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.11 or to complete his original term of incarceration to be subjected to sanctions for violating any post-release control conditions under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.28. Therefore, defendant lacked standing to raise his constitutional challenges to &sect;&sect; 2967.11, 2967.28.</SPAN></P>

The record did not reveal whether the parole board had imposed either bad time or post-release control upon defendant by the time of his appeal. The appellate court held that, because defendant had not yet suffered the actual imposition of additional time in prison or post-release control pursuant to the two statutes in question, he had no standing to challenge their constitutionality in his appeal. The appellate court emphasized, however, its conclusion did not bar defendant from prospectively again raising the constitutionality of the bad time provision or the post-release control concept of the statutes under a proper factual predicate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant entered a written plea of guilty to felony of the fifth degree &sect; 2919.25 charge. The plea was accepted by the trial court on the same day. The trial court sentenced defendant to a 12-month prison term with credit for 50 days' time served. The trial court indicated that it had notified defendant that bad time may be imposed by the parole board under &sect; 2967.11 for certain rule violations committed while in prison. Defendant was ordered to serve as part of his sentence any bad time imposed. Defendant was notified that post-release control was optional in this case up to a maximum of three years, as well as the consequences for violating conditions of post-release control imposed by the parole board under &sect; 2967.28. The appeals court cited the Spikes case as precedent that defendant lacked standing to bring a constitutional challenge to &sect;&sect; 2967.11, .28, but that defendant could prospectively still raise the &quot;bad time&quot; or &quot;post-release control&quot; constitutionality issues under a future proper factual predicate.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, the court held that the existence of the sole death penalty specification under the first count of aggravated murder was established beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further found that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravated circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors and that the imposition of the death penalty was appropriate because that sentence was not excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court concluded that while the trial court was without jurisdiction or constitutional authority to order federal courts, agencies, or officials to seal federal conviction records, the trial court could nevertheless expunge federal conviction records maintained in the state by state officials or agencies, provided such records were not maintained or utilized by those state officials or agencies pursuant to any federal law. Where the state created a disability resulting from a federal conviction, it could constitutionally provide for the removal of that disability; but where the federal government created or mandated a disability resulting from a federal conviction, the state could not provide for the removal of that federally-created disability without offending the Supremacy Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant left a bar and got in a vehicle. He drove away. He drove for several minutes, during which time he executed two turns without difficulty. He was then traveling down an unmarked road. He executed a stop and continued by driving straight through an intersection. A car following his was being driven by a police officer, who noticed defendant was driving in the middle of the road. After defendant made another turn, the officer had defendant stop his vehicle. The officer noticed defendant appeared to be intoxicated. The officer wrote the wrong municipal ordinance violation section on the citation. After defendant's motion to suppress was denied, the appellate court held that even though the officer wrote the wrong violation section on the citation and did not have reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop, the officer did have probable cause to make the stop based on defendant's violation of an ordinance requiring him to drive on the right side of the unmarked road rather than in its center. While it noted the officer's mistake, it found the evidence was undisputed that defendant was violating the law, which provided probable cause to make the stop.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with disturbing the peace under Cuyahoga Falls, Oh., Codified Ordinance 505.09(a)(2) due to his habitually barking dog. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. The trial court denied the motion and convicted defendant of violating the ordinance. Defendant appealed, alleging that the ordinance violated defendant's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process of law because the dog was provoked and because a dog barking 15-20 minutes in a rural area was a harmless act and that it was error for the trial court to deny defendant's pretrial motion to dismiss because the ordinance was vague and permitted selective and arbitrary enforcement. The court held that defendant failed to properly raise the issue of the constitutionality of the ordinance at the trial court level, that defendant's naked assertion of a constitutional violation was insufficient to establish a violation of his due process right, that the evidence was sufficient to establish a violation of the ordinance, and that defendant's due process rights were not impinged upon as a result of his conviction because the ordinance was rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and the State entered into a plea bargain. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the trial court did not err in granting the State's motion for summary judgment. The court reasoned that: (1) the State filed its motion within the time affixed by the trial court, and was therefore timely filed; (2) Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21(D), the provision that set forth the time period for the State's response, was directory rather than mandatory; (3) defendant failed to object to the timeliness of the motion before the trial court, and his defense counsel agreed to the trial court's extension of time for filing of the State's motion for summary judgment; and (4) even if the State's motion for summary judgment had been untimely filed, the error was harmless. The court reasoned that motion was timely filed because the record contained an extension in which the trial court, for good cause shown, extended the time for filing of the State's Motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court noted that the issue of liability had been previously litigated and that, under principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel, both drivers were 50 percent negligent. Therefore, the trial court found them to be jointly and severally liable for the total damages owed to the company. On appeal, the driver argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.31(B)(2), which provided for apportionment of damages, should have been applied retroactively and that he was only responsible for 50 percent of the total judgment. The court disagreed. The court, applying a two-pronged test, first determined that the plain language of &sect; 2307.31(B)(2) and of legislative comment did not prevent retroactive application. Under the second prong of the test, however, the court determined that retroactive application of &sect; 2307.31(B)(2) violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 because the company's right to seek and collect damages jointly and severally from the driver and the other was a vested right. Therefore, because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2307.31(B)(2) affected substantive rights, the court concluded that its retroactive application was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced. Later, the trial court conducted a hearing on a recommendation that defendant be determined to be a sexual predator. The trial court found defendant to be a sexual predator. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09 violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the federal Constitution, the retroactive-laws prohibition of the Ohio Constitution, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the federal Constitution, and that it was unconstitutionally vague. The appellate court found that the Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09 was not unconstitutional. Defendant also argued that the judgment was against the manifest weight of the evidence. The trial court had relied on the certified copies of the judgment entry in making it determination. The appellate court held that hearsay evidence could be considered at a sexual predator hearing if it was reliable. Owing to an appeal of the original conviction, a complete record of defendant's trial was available, but the trial court did not examine that record. The duty of the trial court to examine the entire available record could not be avoided. Defendant's assignment of error had merit to the extent that the trial court failed to examine the entire record.</SPAN></P>

In its sentencing order, the trial court stated that defendant could be subjected to bad time, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.11, and post release control, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.28. Defendant appealed the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2967.11, 2967.28, were unconstitutional in that they violated due process, double jeopardy, separation of powers, and equal protection. The appellate court held that under a previous ruling, a prisoner who was notified that he was subject to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2967.11, 2967.28, but who had not yet been subjected to additional prison time or post release control sanctions, lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of these statutory provisions. Thus, defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statutes. The appellate court expressly indicated that nothing in its mandate in this case should be construed as creating a bar by way of res judicata or collateral estoppel that in any way would prohibit the defendant from prospectively again raising the constitutionality of the bad time provision contained in Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Lake County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division (Ohio) that found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.26(B)(4) was constitutional, found that he met the criteria therein for mandatory bindover, and relinquished its jurisdiction over him to its adult division.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that: (1) he was prejudiced when the adult division of the trial court heard his case although it lacked subject matter jurisdiction; and (2) the adult division of the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear his case because Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.26 was unconstitutional and therefore void. Assuming that defendant did have a protected statutory right by virtue of former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.26 to be treated as a juvenile, the State also had equal, if not more pressing, interests in protecting its citizens from serious, potentially violent offenders and in reducing violent offenses committed by juveniles. The juvenile court's judgment entries were complete with discussions and findings of facts, an analysis of the constitutionality of &sect; 2151.26, and its ultimate conclusion to relinquish its exclusive jurisdiction over defendant. Because the juvenile court fully complied with bindover procedures that were declared valid, the adult division had subject matter jurisdiction over defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had pleaded guilty to two counts of rape pursuant to a plea agreement. Defendant had made a motion to withdraw his guilty plea pursuant to Ohio R. Crim. P. 32.1, which the trial court had denied. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of the motion to withdraw the guilty plea because it found defendant had made the plea knowingly and intelligently, and defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel. The fact that defendant was not advised of the possibility that he might be labeled a sexual predator at the time of the plea did not render it unknowingly made. Further, defendant had not sustained his burden in showing that withdrawal of the plea was necessary to correct a manifest injustice. Next, the court found defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel. Because the transcript was unavailable, the court presumed the regularity of the trial court's proceedings with respect to the plea requirements, as provided in Ohio. R. Crim. P. 11(C)(2)(a). Finally, defendant had not shown with a reasonable probability that he would not have pleaded guilty but for his counsel's alleged misconduct in erroneously advising him of shock probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion for acquittal on the charge of attempted aggravated murder, and in sentencing defendant on count one under former Ohio Rev.

The appellate court found that from the circumstances surrounding the attack on the victim's car and the events that transpired later in the day, the jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant had intended to kill his victim in the church parking lot earlier that day. Thus, a rational trier of fact could have concluded that defendant had attempted to murder the victim at that time, only to be thwarted by other churchgoers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Lake County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), following defendant's guilty plea to failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.331, sentenced defendant to an agreed six-month prison term. The trial court notified defendant that he could be subject to bad time and post-release control imposed by the parole board. Defendant appealed the sentence imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2967.11, .28 were unconstitutional on due process, double jeopardy, separation of powers, and equal protection grounds. Those statutes allowed the parole board to impose bad time credit, and to subject a prisoner to post-release control upon their release from prison. The appellate court held that defendant lacked standing to bring a constitutional challenge to the statutes. Defendant did not allege that he had been subjected to the bad time provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.11 or the post-release control provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.28. Nor did the record indicate that defendant had been so subjected. He merely claimed that because he was sentenced pursuant to these provisions, he had the potential to be subjected to extended prison time or post-release control. Therefore, the issues raised on appeal were not yet ripe for review. Defendant failed to allege a concrete injury which would establish standing to bring the instant appeal. The appellate court held its decision did not create a res judicata bar to a future constitutional challenge by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated murder while committing or attempting to commit aggravated robbery. The trial court imposed the sentence of death of each count. Upon direct appeal, the convictions and sentences were affirmed. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in dismissing his post-conviction petition, which contained eleven separate grounds for relief. Defendant first asserted that trial counsel's investigation and presentation of evidence was ineffective and that the presentation of expert testimony in the mitigation stage was ineffective. The court held defendant's claim amounted to second-guessing an arguable trial strategy and did not meet the threshold standard of cogency. All of the ineffective assistance claims were without merit. Defendant also alleged that the trial court erred by denying appellant's discovery requests. The court held that this argument was not well taken. A petitioner for postconviction relief had no right to discovery until it was determined that an evidentiary hearing was warranted.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment to the injured persons and their spouses. The tortfeasor's insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured persons were involved in a motor vehicle accident caused by the tortfeasor's negligence. The injured persons sought recovery for their personal injuries, and their spouses sought recovery for loss of consortium. The trial court's ruling was based on the Supreme Court of Ohio's determination in Savoie. The court held that Savoie did not apply and that each injured person and his respective spouse was limited to one per person policy limit for personal injuries. The legislature responded to the Savoie decision by enacting Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.44. The statute provided that only one policy limit applied to all the claims arising out of one person's bodily injuries. The tortfeasor's insurance policy unambiguously stated that a spouse's loss of consortium claim and an injured person's claim for personal injuries were subject to a single per person limit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the trial court's order that granted summary judgment to the injured persons and their spouses and held that the tortfeasor's insurer was liable up to its $ 100,000 policy per person personal injury limits for each of the injured persons and each of the injured persons' spouses. The court entered final judgment for the insurer.</SPAN></P>

The representative of the deceased sought underinsured motorist coverage for the deceased's injuries and subsequent death that resulted from an automobile accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The deceased, who was a passenger in a vehicle that collided with another vehicle, was ejected from the vehicle and died. The representative of the deceased's estate settled its wrongful death and tort claims with the insurers of the drivers of both vehicles. The representative alleged that the liability limits under the insurance policies were exhausted and that they were eligible for underinsured motorist coverage limits. The insurers contended that the representative did not comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12 and therefore, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to enter a final judgment in this matter. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.12 provided that the attorney general must be served in any proceeding that involved the validity of a municipal ordinance. The court agreed that the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the matter. Upon remand, the court stated that the trial court could reinstate its judgment without another evidentiary hearing. The trial court was limited, however, to awarding damages as provided in the contract. As such, the representative was entitled to $ 100,000 per person or $ 300,000 per occurrence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded because the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the matter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted on one court of rape, and pled guilty. The trial court sentenced defendant to 6 to 15 years in prison. Defendant appealed, but the conviction was affirmed. Defendant later moved for a revised sentence, and to withdraw his guilty plea. The Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denied the motions. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued the trial court should have applied Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (Ohio 1996) retroactively and revised his maximum sentence downward, and that certain new parole procedures and guidelines implemented pursuant to that bill were unconstitutional. As to the effect of changes in the parole guidelines, defendant had not alleged that he had yet been denied parole, and therefore, his claim was not ripe for adjudication. Thus, the court of appeals found that the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to modify his sentence. Defendant also argued his trial counsel's performance was ineffective, and therefore, his motion to withdraw his plea should have been granted. The court of appeals concluded that defendant's trial counsel could not possibly have known in April 1990 of the future effects of legislation which became effective more than six years after defendant's plea was entered. Thus, defendant had not demonstrated that his attorney's representation fell below a reasonable standard or that he was prejudiced by the representation he received. In addition, the appellate court found the claim barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) the defendant failed to prove ineffective assistance of counsel; (2) the medical testimony was admissible even though the doctor did not specialize in infectious diseases; (3) the expert witnesses were permitted to testify as to possibilities; (4) the defendant failed to prove that the police officer affiant had misrepresented material facts in the affidavit supporting the search warrant; (5) although the trial court erroneously admitted testimony that the defendant had invoked his right to counsel and the prosecutor made several improper comments, all of those errors were harmless; and (6) the death penalty was constitutional and not disproportionate to the crime of which the defendant was convicted.</SPAN></P>

Permission was denied by the city because of a fire prevention ordinance that prohibited the storage of bulk propane in any areas that were not zoned as general industrial districts. On appeal, the company argued that the trial court erred by applying the burden of proof required to challenge the validity of zoning legislation to legislation that was part of the city's fire prevention code and which was, therefore, not part of the zoning legislation. Upon review, the appellate court determined that any error in the application of the zoning case law presented mere harmless error at best, for which a reversal was not mandated. While the usefulness of the ordinance in promoting the safety and welfare of the city may have been debatable, the company failed to show beyond fair debate that the zoning ordinance did not substantially advance the city's legitimate governmental interest in protecting and maintaining the safety of its citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of aggravated murder and he was sentenced to death. Defendant brought a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21 alleging that the trial court erred in denying him access to exculpatory materials. The trial court denied the petition and defendant appealed. The court ruled that the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violated due process where the evidence was material to guilt. Further, the court held that the mere possibility that an item of non-disclosed information could have helped the defense or could have affected the outcome of the trial did not establish materiality in the constitutional sense. Also, the court found that defendant's voluminous listing of alleged material evidence suppressed by the state did not show that the state violated defendant's constitutional right to such evidence. The court affirmed the judgment denying the petition for postconviction relief, concluding that the cumulative effect of all the non-disclosed evidence that defendant alleged was material would not have impacted the result of the trial.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02(A)(1)(b), and for receiving stolen property, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2913.51(A).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that it was error to label him a sexual predator, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01 et seq. Defendant raped the victim in an apartment. During jury selection, defendant's counsel objected that there were no African Americans on the jury and that the median age was over 40. The court found that defendant failed to timely raise his challenges to the array before examining the jurors on voir dire. Having failed to timely raise the challenge, defendant waived the right. As to his constitutional rights, he did not offer evidence that races were unfairly represented in relation to the number of such persons in the county and that under-representation was due to systematic exclusion from the jury selection process. Given the tender age of the victim as well as the consistency of her multiple accounts of the rape, there was no merit to the argument that the victim's testimony was elicited through leading questions. The sexual predator classification scheme did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest, protecting the public from sex offenders. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On consolidated appeal, the appellate court found that the application of Ohio Rev.

However, given that there were conflicting judgments from other appellate courts on the issue, the record was certified to the Supreme Court of Ohio for review and final determination on the issue of the constitutionality of the application of Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) convicted defendant for aggravated murder and imposed the sentence of death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that the trial court erred by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding two of defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Defendant alleged ineffective assistance of counsel through affidavits naming uncalled witnesses whose testimony may have demonstrated evidence significant to defendant. Given the information contained within the affidavits, trial counsel's failure to call any expert witnesses could have risen to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel prejudicial to the rights of defendant. Thus, the trial court should have conducted an evidentiary hearing to determine more fully the nature of the testimony of the two witnesses, as well as the strategic reasoning of trial counsel for not presenting this expert testimony. However, the trial court did not err by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing or by denying the petition as to the remaining claims of error. Furthermore, the trial court correctly overruled defendant's motion for discovery. Also, defendant's claim of inadequate corrective process was not ripe for review. Finally, the doctrine of cumulative error was not applicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court denying defendant's petition for post-conviction relief without a hearing was reversed, and the case was remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel as it related to trial counsel's failure to present expert testimony. The judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court held that there was no error or double jeopardy violation. The trial court was required by Ohio Rev.

Therefore, the trial court modified its prior sentence to require that the term for the escape offense be served consecutively to the terms defendant served for her other two offenses. Moreover, defendant made no objection to being resentenced on this basis. Additionally, because defendant's escape offense was committed after the change in Ohio Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which denied his petition for post-conviction relief.

The court held that in light of the fact that defendant's direct appeal was dismissed for the failure to timely prosecute it, the filing of his petition, approximately two months past 180 days from the date that the record was filed, was untimely. The court concluded that, even if defendant had timely filed his petition, he still would not have prevailed. Defendant was not denied equal protection as a result of the trial court's refusal to apply Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (Ohio) to him. Senate Bill 2 did not apply to crimes that were committed before its effective date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer had cut a hole in the safety guard on an injection molding machine to permit installation of a robotic arm and had never installed specially fabricated new guards. The employee was hurt when he reached through the hole to dislodge a part that had become stuck. The employee's action also named as defendants the machine's manufacturer and the installer of the robotic arm, but he did not appeal from the summary judgment granted to the manufacturer and the partial summary judgment granted to the installer. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The employer's conduct in modifying the machine and failing to install safety guards was not so substantially certain to injure employees as to constitute intentional tort. The deliberate removal of the guard was a factor to be considered but did not create a rebuttable presumption of intent. Knowledge of the risk entailed in failing to install new guards was not intent, and the employer could not have anticipated the employee's actions. The factual disputes that remained unresolved between the employer and employee did not bar summary judgment because they related to ancillary issues and were not genuine or material.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant alleged that the municipal court incorrectly failed to suppress evidence of his intoxication obtained as the result of a traffic stop because the initial traffic stop was not supported by a reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity, the municipal traffic ordinance that allegedly justified the stop was unconstitutional, and the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed, holding that because the initial traffic stop was supported by a reasonable suspicion that defendant had violated the municipal traffic ordinance, the traffic stop was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, and there was no error in the denial of defendant's motion to suppress. The court also held that the ordinance did not conflict with any state law, and the conduct prohibited by the ordinance was apparent from the language used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Parents brought a wrongful death action on behalf of their minor children more than two years after the accident that killed the children's fathers. The parents claimed that the two-year wrongful death statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2125.02(D), was tolled by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.16 because the children were minors. The trial court ruled against the parents, and the court agreed. The court noted that the right to bring a wrongful death action was statutorily created and did not exist at common law. The court further held that, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2125.02(D), a demonstration that a decedent's death had taken place within two years of instituting a wrongful death suit was in fact a condition precedent to bringing a wrongful death action. The court also held that the time limits prescribed in the wrongful death statute could not be diminished or embellished based on the underlying wrongful act that caused the death of the decedent in a particular case. The court also dismissed the parents' equal protection arguments because a wrongful death action was required to be brought in the name of the decedent's personal representative, not in the name of individual beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Common Pleas Court, County of Summit (Ohio) that, following a jury trial, convicted him of murder, which was a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.02, and two counts of attempted murder, violations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2923.02, 2903.02, with four firearm specifications. Defendant was also convicted of aggravated robbery, felonious assault, and carrying a concealed weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions stemmed from two separate incidents. Victims of his crimes identified defendant from a six-man photo array. On appeal the court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction and held that: (1) defendant failed to demonstrate that the pretrial identification procedures were suggestive, (2) defendant failed to demonstrate that the trial court exceeded its statutory authority by imposing consecutive sentences, (3) defendant failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the joinder of these offenses for trial, and (4) any inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony related to only minor details of the incident, not to the elements of the offenses. The court reversed and remanded that part of defendant's sentence that imposed three mandatory terms of incarceration on the firearm specifications attached to the murder and attempted murder convictions. The court ruled that the trial court had applied the wrong standard when it determined whether the offenses were committed as part of the same transaction. The fact that defendant fired multiple shots at multiple victims did not demonstrate that the shootings were not part of the same transaction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment that convicted defendant. The aspect of defendant's sentence that imposed three mandatory terms of incarceration on the firearm specifications was reversed. On remand, the trial court was ordered to apply the correct test to determine whether three mandatory terms of incarceration on the firearm specifications attached to the offenses of attempted murder and murder could have been imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) entered final judgments of conviction after a jury found defendant guilty of aggravated robbery, robbery, and felonious assault, all with firearm specifications.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A man entered an apartment building and was accosted by a person with a handgun. The man fled, the gunman pursued him, and the gunman shot the man in the leg. As the man fled, he discarded his keys, some money, and hid behind a car. The gunman picked up the property and left. The man remained behind the car for nearly three minutes. The gunman appeared again and began a second chase. The man then discarded more money, but the gunman again shot him in the leg and retrieved the property. Police arrived and defendant was apprehended nearby. Defendant was brought back to the scene and identified as the gunman. After his motion to suppress identification was denied and he was convicted of several crimes, the appellate court found: (1) the convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence, (2) the convictions were supported by sufficient evidence, (3) the motion to suppress was properly denied as the one-man showup identification was not impermissibly suggestive, (4) sentencing error was committed on the firearm specifications as only one criminal transaction was involved, and (5) defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty in the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, Ohio, to two counts of sexual battery and one count of attempted gross sexual imposition for his acts of sexually abusing his granddaughters, one of whom was six years old, and the other was nine years old. The trial court issued an order adjudicating defendant a sexual predator. Defendant appealed the sexual predator ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued on appeal that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950 was unconstitutional, as the statutory sexual-predator scheme violated the ex post facto, retroactivity provisions, and the double jeopardy clauses of the federal and Ohio constitutions. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in labeling him a sexual predator, as the State did not present clear and convincing evidence that he was likely to commit another sexually-oriented offense. The appellate court overruled defendant's assignments of error regarding the constitutionality ch. 2950 on the authority of State v. Lance, and State v. Boeddeker. After reviewing the record, including defendant's admissions at the sexual-predator hearing that he sexually abused the girls at least six or eight times, the appellate court held that the decision to label defendant a sexual predator was supported by clear and convincing evidence. However, as defendant was adjudicated a sexual predator, and completed his term of incarceration before the effective date of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.04, the trial court lacked the statutory authority to order defendant to register, pursuant to that statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court: (1) affirmed the judgment adjudicating defendant a sexual predator; and (2) vacated the entry journalizing the order to register and ordering the county sheriff to &quot;process&quot; defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The disabled party, who had moderate mental retardation, participated in a waiver program, under which she waived a portion of her Medicaid in return for home and community based services. When the disabled party began the program, the department authorized 133 hours per week of various types of assistance for the disabled party. Eventually, the department reduced the hours of service to 35 hours per week. In reversing the decision of the department, the trial court found that the disabled party's procedural rights were not satisfied in the development of the disabled party's individual service plan (ISP) and that the decision to reduce the service hours was not supported by the evidence. The appellate court found that it could not determine whether the trial court used the correct standard of review on the issue of the reduction of the disabled party's service hours. The county board satisfied the procedural requirements in developing the disabled party's ISP. The disabled party's representative was informed of the results of the assessment and application of the protocol, and after the ISP meeting, she was advised of the disabled party's right to a state hearing.</SPAN></P>

The convictions arose from murders that were committed by defendant during a prison riot. Defendant's sentence and convictions were affirmed on appeal. In response to defendant's numerous assignments of error on appeal, the court found that the limitations the trial court had placed on voir dire had not denied defendant of a fair and impartial jury. After collectively evaluating the information that defendant claimed the state should have disclosed to him, the court found that the information was not material and, therefore, that the state did not have to disclose it. Although the prosecutor may have occasionally made some improper comments during the lengthy trial, the court could not say that the prosecutorial misconduct had prejudicially affected defendant's substantial rights. Moreover, the court found that the trial court properly admitted gruesome victim photos because their probative value outweighed their prejudicial effect. Finally, the court found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The manufacturer was not a party to the appeal because of bankruptcy proceedings. The employee was injured at work when his hand was mangled by the press brake.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the employer filed its motion for summary judgment, the employee was granted more time to respond, during which time he tried to depose another employee who was injured in a similar manner a year earlier. However, the employer's motion for summary judgment was granted because the trial court found no just cause for delay, although the trial court did not specifically rule on the employee's own motion for summary judgment before granting summary judgment to the employer. On appeal, however, the court found that the trial court allowed sufficient time for discovery before granting summary judgment because the trial court granted an additional three weeks and because the employee did not try to conduct discovery until the summary judgment schedule outline was issued. The court further found that summary judgment was proper for the employer under Ohio R. Civ. P. 56(C) because the evidence, construed in the employee's favor, did not show &quot;substantial certainty&quot; of harm. At most, the evidence showed that the employer knew that the press brake was a dangerous instrumentality. However, knowledge did not equal intent, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2745.01 imposed a heightened standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In June 1980, defendant was convicted on seven counts of rape and three counts of corruption of a minor and sentenced to concurrent terms of incarceration for the offenses. In March 1997, the trial court ordered defendant returned from the penitentiary for a sexual predator hearing pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950. The hearing did not yield a finding as to defendant's sexual predator status because the trial court, in ruling on defendant's motion challenging the constitutionality of ch. 2950.09, held that the statute violated the prohibition against retroactive laws set forth in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28. On appeal by the state, the court reversed and held that ch. 2950 was improperly deemed impermissibly retroactive as applied to defendant. Defendant, as an incarcerated individual, had not yet incurred an obligation under ch. 2950 to register with law enforcement officials. Thus, he lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the legislation's registration provisions as they applied to him and the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant him relief in the form of a declaration that the legislation was unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The car owner's vehicle was impounded, pursuant to Ohio Rev.

Judgment was entered ordering that the car owner's vehicle and her license plates be returned. However, in the interim, the towing company had sold the vehicle. On review of the dismissal of the car owner's claims, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that the car owner failed to establish that: 1) the state patrol breached its duty of ordinary care; 2) the state patrol wrongfully converted her vehicle; 3) the initial impoundment of the vehicle rose to the level of a taking; or that 4) the towing company violated the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (CSPA), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1345 et seq. Claims by the car owner that did have merit were that the towing company, as a bailee, breached its duty to return the property when it sold the vehicle and, by selling the vehicle, had exercised wrongful dominion and control, so as to support a conversion claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant corporation challenged judgments from the Hamilton County Municipal Court (Ohio), which were related to the corporation's failure to abide by plaintiff city's orders purporting to take remedial measures to bring the corporation's vacant buildings into compliance with building codes. The corporation also challenged judgments convicting it of violating the terms of probation imposed by the trial court for violating the city's orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The underlying dispute in the case involved a city ordinance that required the owners of vacant buildings to acquire licenses for the buildings. Failure to obtain the license carried criminal penalties. Thus, the corporation obtained licenses for several properties it owned, but the licenses were issued conditioned on certain repairs being made. When the repairs were not made, the city filed complaints in municipal court alleging that the corporation violated Cincinnati, Ohio, Municipal Code &sect; 1101-54, which made it a crime to fail to comply with a lawful order of the Director of Building and Inspections. While the corporation's case was pending, the court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional in a related case. Thus, the corporation argued that the trial court's convictions were void. On appeal, the court held that the convictions were not void, but that the trial court's decisions were erroneous. In pertinent part, the court held that the trial court erroneously placed the burden of proof on the corporation, when in fact the city bore the burden of proving that the city's orders were &quot;lawful&quot; orders based on information that was obtained lawfully.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and set aside the judgments of the trial court against the corporation. Accordingly, the court remanded the cases to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the trial court (Ohio), which entered a jury verdict finding defendant guilty of aggravated robbery and robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's first assignment of error related to the sentence imposed for the crimes of which he was convicted. On appeal, the court held that based on the court's opinion in a prior case, the trial court erred in failing to apply the new sentencing guidelines set forth in Senate Bill 2, even though defendant's crimes were committed before the effective date of the act. The court took notice that it had previously held that the provision in Senate Bill 2 prohibiting the application of the State's new sentencing guidelines to persons who committed crimes before the bill's effective date but were sentenced afterwards was unconstitutional. Because the Supreme Court of Ohio had accepted jurisdiction to review the court's decision on Senate Bill 2, the court stayed reversal of the sentence in defendant's case pending the disposition of the case before the Supreme Court of Ohio. The court, however, ruled that the trial court did not commit plain error in failing to give an accomplice instruction, and that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ruled that the part of the trial court's judgment reflecting the jury's guilty verdicts of defendant was affirmed.

The court stayed its vacation of defendant's sentence pending the issuance of the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court on the newly enacted statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A criminal complaint was filed against relator charging her with a felony. A preliminary hearing before the judge resulted in a finding that the State's evidence was insufficient to support a bindover on the felony charge, but the evidence was sufficient to support a misdemeanor charge. The judge ordered that the charge against relator be amended that the case be bound over to a county grand jury. In response to relator's mandamus action, the judge argued that an action in mandamus was not the proper procedural mechanism for contesting the merits of the bindover decision. The court found that relator actually sought a determination that jurisdiction had not vested in the court of common pleas. Because relator had not been convicted of any offense at the time, she still had the opportunity to contest the jurisdiction issue in a direct appeal. Relator's petition showed that she would have been unable to prove that she lacked an adequate remedy at law; therefore, her petition did not state a viable claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State sought review of a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Ashland County (Ohio), which granted defendant's motion to dismiss her indictment for two counts of involuntary manslaughter for violations of the cruel and unusual punishment and equal protection clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's indictment for two counts of involuntary manslaughter was based on the deaths of two passengers of a car with which defendant's car collided. The underlying misdemeanor traffic offenses which the involuntary manslaughter counts were based on were strict liability offenses. On appeal, the State argued that Ohio's involuntary manslaughter statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann &sect; 2903.04(B), as applied in the case, violated neither the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution nor the ban on cruel and unusual punishment under Ohio Const. art. 1, &sect; 9, and that the trial court erred in dismissing the indictment. Upon review, the court found that the trial court did not err in dismissing the indictment against defendant. Because there was no evidence of criminal culpability but merely bad driving or a simple lapse from good driving judgment, the punishment of the involuntary manslaughter statute was grossly disproportionate to the underlying minor misdemeanor traffic offenses and it shocked the sense of justice of the community.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the mother argued, inter alia, that (1) it was prejudicial error for the trial court to terminate her parental rights when the children's services department failed to provide a specific plan of its actions to seek an adoptive family for the children and to prepare the children for adoption; (2) she received ineffective assistance of counsel; (3) the trial court's failure to appoint the children's father an attorney was reversible error; and (4) Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1993, defendant pled guilty to three counts of gross sexual imposition and was sentenced to consecutive prison terms of two years on each count. While he was incarcerated, the trial court conducted a hearing and adjudicated defendant a sexual predator, pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2950.09(C)(1), which provided that an offender who was convicted of or pled guilty to a sexually oriented offense prior to 1997 and was sentenced prior to 1997, but serving a term of imprisonment on or after January 1, 1997, could be so adjudicated. On appeal, the court affirmed, reasoning that it had previously held that &sect; 2950.09 was constitutional and that the sexual predator law was not punitive so it did not violate the Ex Post Facto clause, and that the law was remedial, not substantive, so it did not violate the Ohio constitutional prohibition against retroactive legislation. The court certified the record to the supreme court, however, for review and final determination on the issue of the constitutionality of the application of &sect; 2950.09(C)(1) to conduct prior to the effective date of the statute, noting that other appellate courts had rendered conflicting judgments on the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A fire broke out at the business owner's place of business and a call was placed to the 9-1-1 emergency system. There was a delay of approximately 15 minutes before a unit could respond to the business because the nearest fire station had been taken off-line temporarily and the second-closest station had been sent to another fire. The business owner sustained burns to his body and his business was severely damaged. He filed a complaint in which he alleged that the injuries he suffered were the direct and proximate result of the city's delay in responding to the fire and its negligent, willful, wanton, and reckless decision to take the station nearest his business off-line for training during business hours. The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss. The court affirmed, holding that the city was immune from liability because the business owner's cause of action did not fall within an exception to the general blanket immunity provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2744.02. The court also rejected the business owner's contention that sections of &sect; 2744 were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the adjudication pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The court held that the trial court's consideration of evidence that may have been objectionable as to form was not plain error because, had defendant interposed an objection as to form, better evidence might have been presented. The court held that the ineffectiveness of his trial counsel was not be demonstrated from the record. The court held that &sect; 2950.01, et seq. was not an ex post facto law and did not violate the prohibition in Ohio Const. Art. II, &sect; 28 against retroactive laws. The court held that the double jeopardy provision of the U.S. Const. amend V. did not apply to Ohio's sexual predator law because it had a remedial, rather than a punitive purpose, for purposes of ex post facto analysis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of committing gross sexual imposition against his 11-year-old daughter. The child lived with defendant until he was jailed for theft, when she was placed in foster care. Defendant was charged when the child told her foster mother that he had rubbed her vagina. On appeal, the court affirmed and found that any rational trier of fact could have found that the essential elements of gross sexual imposition were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court ruled that the verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence because it was reasonable for the jury to infer that, under the circumstances, defendant did not touch his daughter for any other purpose than his own sexual arousal or gratification. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the maximum sentence for each count based on the statutory factors and given defendant's criminal history and the nature of the offense, the sentence was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. The court concluded that there was no error in not merging the two counts into one because the evidence established that they occurred on two separate occasions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C)(1) violated the United States Constitution's proscription against ex post facto laws and the Ohio Constitution's prohibition on retroactive laws. The State responded that the sexual predator statutes were not meant to punish past acts. Instead, the State was looking backward and forward for evidence of a propensity to reoffend existing now and in the future. The court of appeals found this argument compelling. The statutory scheme did not impose an affirmative disability or restraint. The notification provisions were not comparable to the use of public humiliation. Although the dissemination of this information carried a social stigma, this type of incidental effect was not historically regarded as punishment. Registration served to apprise law enforcement authorities of the whereabouts of known, and potentially dangerous, sex offenders. The trial court considered all relevant factors, including those in Ohio.  Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2). Although the trial court erred in finding defendant showed no remorse and in fact admitted he could not help himself, this error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court reversed. Constrained by Ohio Supreme Court precedent, the court held that &sect; 2745.01 was unconstitutional under the Ohio Constitution. The legislature's attempt to supersede Ohio Supreme Court decisions with which it disagreed had failed because these decisions were grounded in constitutional principles. The legislature did not have the power to circumvent the Ohio Constitution. Employer-intentional-tort claims were subject to a heightened pleading requirement. Even under this heightened pleading requirement, the employee's allegations survived a motion to dismiss because they alleged that the employer had knowledge that a safety guard on the press was not operational and that an injury was substantially certain to occur.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During a stop on an outstanding arrest warrant, police found two bags of crack cocaine on defendant. He was indicted for possession of cocaine under Ohio Rev. Code &sect; 2925.11(A). Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge on the basis that the distinction in &sect; 2925.11(A) between crack cocaine and powder cocaine violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Ohio Constitutions. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant was convicted. Defendant sought review, and the court affirmed. The court held that the statutory distinction between crack cocaine and powder cocaine had a rational purpose that was not racially discriminatory. Therefore, the court said, even though that distinction may have had a disparate impact on members of a racial minority, it was not unconstitutional. The court found that &sect; 2925.11(A) imposed a greater penalty on a person convicted of possessing crack cocaine than on a person convicted of possessing an equivalent amount of powder cocaine. The court concluded that there was a rational basis for this distinction because an equivalent amount of crack cocaine was more potent, because of the way it was ingested, than powder cocaine.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that defendant's time for appeal expired on or about February 23, 1997. His petition for postconviction relief was filed on October 21, 1997, approximately 240 days after his time for appeal expired, well beyond the limit for filing a timely petition. It was, therefore, untimely filed. Finally, the appellate court found that a review of defendant's petition revealed that he did not meet either of the criteria of Ohio Rev.

Defendant's &quot;consent&quot; was obtained while he was in pain, lying on a gurney in the emergency room of the hospital. Defendant &quot;consented&quot; to having his blood drawn only after the &quot;arresting&quot; officer told him that she was going to order the procedure and only after the officer read defendant the implied consent form which included information as to the consequences of defendant's failure to consent to the draw. The officer admitted that she did not arrest defendant at the scene and did not arrest him at the hospital prior to reading him the implied consent form. The language of Ohio Rev.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that it was not required to address defendant's constitutional challenges to the provisions of S.B.

Three days later, the Ohio legislature amended the statute to comply with the state supreme court's ruling and gave minors four years after turning 18 to file personal injury lawsuits against political subdivisions. The trial court granted school district's motion for summary judgment on the ground that it was barred by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2305.10.

After his arrest, an officer who unsuccessfully chased defendant identified him while defendant was in custody in the courthouse. The trial court ruled that defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel should have been brought on direct appeal from his conviction, and, thus, were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. On appeal, the court found that res judicata was a proper basis for dismissing defendant's postconviction petition, as defense counsel's neglect to file a motion to suppress the officer's identification testimony or to object to it at trial would not have precluded the court from deciding defendant's constitutional claim on direct appeal. Further, the trial court's factual findings and conclusions of law were adequate to apprise defendant of the reasons for denying a hearing and to permit meaningful appellate review. Finally, even if the ineffective assistance of counsel issue was not barred by res judicata, defendant did not present a substantive ground for relief so as to be entitled to a hearing on whether he should have been convicted for attempt offenses rather for felonious assault offenses.</SPAN></P>

His convictions and sentences were then affirmed. Thereafter, defendant filed a postconviction relief petition. He argued in his petition that some of his convictions were not merely voidable, but void, and that the statutes establishing the offenses for which he was convicted were facially unconstitutional. The State moved to dismiss the petition upon the grounds that it was not timely filed. The trial court agreed with the State and dismissed the petition. After the petition was dismissed, the appellate court found that defendant's challenges either were raised at trial or on direct appeal and were rejected, or were not raised and were waived. It also found that defendant had not met the timeliness requirement set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.23 for filing a petition for postconviction relief. It pointed out that the statutory provision had two subdivisions and both had to apply for the timeliness requirement to be met.

Based on a previous court decision, the appellate court concluded that the application of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950 to conduct prior to the effective date of the statute violated Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28, because it constituted a retroactive application of the law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant father appealed from a judgment of the Wood County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division (Ohio), which denied the father's motion to modify child support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The action arose after the parties obtained a divorce and agreed to a shared parenting plan which gave custody of the children to the mother 60 percent of the time, and to the father 40 percent of the time. The father was also ordered to pay child support in accordance with the worksheet. On appeal, the father argued that the trial court should have deviated from the guidelines because the child now spent more time with the father than with the mother. The court of appeals found that the trial court's decision not to deviate from the statutory guidelines was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable, and therefore, not an abuse of discretion. The court of appeals declined to address the father's argument that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3709.04(K)(6), 3113.215(C), 3113.215(B)(6)(a), were unconstitutionally vague because they gave the trial court unbridled discretion to select which part will be the obligor with respect to child support under a shared parenting plan, since he failed to raise the issue in the trial court.

The Court of Common Pleas sentenced defendant, according to sentencing guidelines in effect in 1995, to an indeterminate term of incarceration of 10 to 25 years for both offenses, to be served concurrently with an aggregate term of not less than 10 and not more than 25 years, and declined to impose the sexual predator classification, finding the applicable statute to be unconstitutional. The provisions of the sexual predator registration statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09, violated Ohio Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to a resolution passed by city council, the mayor entered into a binding lease with a developer so that the developer could construct and operate a golf course on city property. Thereafter, the taxpayer delivered signed petitions to the city clerk in order to have the resolution placed as a referendum on the general election ballot. The city clerk did not deliver the petitions to the board of elections, and the resolution did not appear on the ballot. The taxpayer then filed a petition for a writ of mandamus compelling the city clerk to submit the petitions and declaring the resolution invalid. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees, and the court affirmed the judgment. In a prior case, the trial court determined that the city had the authority to lease the land at issue for the purpose of operating a golf course. Thus, res judicata barred all future actions relating to the zoning of the property, and the resolution was not void. Further, the referendum would have unconstitutionally impaired a binding contract. Thus, the issues of whether or not the resolution was properly enacted as an emergency measure, or improperly granted a franchise were moot.</SPAN></P>

After the secretary filed an administrative appeal contesting the Commission's finding, the trial court entered a judgment court affirming the Commission's order. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was 15 years old, was accused of attacking the victim by burning her with a heated claw hammer. Defendant was to be tried as an adult. He pleaded guilty to one count of rape and one count of felonious assault. The trial court explained to defendant that he was pleading guilty to a sexually oriented offense and that he would be classified as a sexually oriented offender subjected to statutory post-detention registration requirements. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim that Ohio Rev.

The court held, however, that the application of the registration statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.04, to defendant violated Ohio Const. art.

In affirming the lower court's judgment, the court held that (1) the state's claims that the peremptory strike was motivated by the juror's purportedly evasive responses to questions concerning his religious denomination was supported by the transcript of the proceeding, and the lower court's determination permitting the state to use a peremptory challenge was not clearly erroneous; (2) the introduction of other acts evidence was not erroneous because much of the evidence was offered and used by defendant in his defense; and (3) evidence of defendant's plea to the domestic violence charge was properly admitted where defendant invited such inquiry by his testimony that he was wanted by the authorities for a probation violation.</SPAN></P>

The department of corrections recommended adjudication that he was a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C). The trial court adjudicated him as a sexual predator. He appealed and claimed that the statute violated constitutional provisions prohibiting retroactive laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court had previously rejected challenges concerning the prohibition against retroactive laws and overruled the first three assignments of error. He maintained that the trial court's judgment that he was a sexual predator was against the manifest weight of the evidence and that the pre-sentence report was hearsay. The court held that the pre-sentence report was not entirely hearsay. It contained his admission that he and his two co-defendants sexually assaulted the victim in a brutal manner. Further, it was his handgun that was utilized by the trio to compel the victim to submit to their repeated attacks. The record demonstrated that he was convicted of a sexually oriented offense. The facts demonstrated that he displayed cruelty during the commission of the offense, including that he knew the victim prior to the offense, and that he furnished the firearm used to subdue the victim. In his statement within the pre-sentence report, he also indicated that drugs were involved. Additionally, his prior criminal record included a conviction for domestic violence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment adjudicating defendant a sexual predator, holding that defendant was given a full and fair hearing, his rights of due process were protected and preserved, he was ably represented by competent counsel, and that, indisputably, the trial court considered the applicable factors under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2), applied pertinent provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2971.01(H), and fully and fairly evaluated the responses of defendant through his counsel. Accordingly, the determination of defendant's status as a sexual predator was neither against the manifest weight of the evidence nor otherwise contrary to law. The court vacated the entry requiring the sheriff to process defendant because the record reflected that defendant had not completed his term of imprisonment and that the trial court ordered his return to his resident penal institution following the completion of the limited sexual-predator hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company filed an application for a conditional use permit and site review with the commission. The company requested the permit for the purpose of constructing a cellular communications transmission facility. The commission denied the permit. The trial court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court. The evidence in support of the conditional zoning certificate consisted of three witnesses. One witness explained how the proposed use of the property comported with each of the six general standards the commission had to consider pursuant to the Streetsboro, Ohio, Ordinance &sect; 1153.03. Based on his study evaluating the effect of cellular towers on residential property values, it was opined that the construction did not negatively impact the market value of surrounding land. By contrast, the opposition to the permit consisted of statements made by nearby landowners expressing general concerns about aesthetic deterioration in the area, a potential decline in the market value of property, and general health risks. Legal maters such as zoning variance decisions were to be determined by facts, not subjective beliefs. Thus, the commission arbitrarily denied the permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court overruled defendant's motion to set aside his sentences for each offense. He was sentenced to a definite term of one-and-one-half years for the domestic violence offense and to an indefinite term of not less than 6, nor more than 25, years for the kidnaping offense. At issue was Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B), which provided that if the penalties for any offenses were reduced by a reenactment or amendment to a statute, then the punishment, if not already imposed, had to be according to the statute as amended. Section 1.58(B), however, was only applicable to crimes committed on or after July 1, 1996. Defendant's crimes were committed on October 7, 1989 and December 15, 1989. Therefore, the court found that defendant was not entitled to a resentencing under the amended sentencing laws. Defendant's situation fell squarely within the exception to &sect; 1.58, and, therefore, he was not entitled to a shorter sentence under the new sentencing scheme.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction because (1) the trial court had the discretion under Ohio R. Crim. P. 30(B) whether or not to give a cautionary instruction relating to the credibility of the unindicted alleged accomplices; (2) a witness was not impeachable with convictions involving dishonesty because he was not offered prosecutorial immunity in exchange for his testimony, and he did not act with the requisite mental state of a co-conspirator or accomplice; (3) the motion to quash the indictment was properly denied because defendant failed to show that he was denied a fair trial by the prosecution's conduct or by the fact that the grand jurors which indicted him were not qualified; and (4) the Howard charge was constitutionally permissible where the jury indicated that it was deadlocked.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The township brought the complaint to restrain and enjoin the board's approval of an annexation petition filed by the city and to have the rights, status, and other legal relations concerning the subject annexation determined. The township alleged that the city passed two emergency resolutions, which were unconstitutional, invalid, and contrary to law. On appeal, the court was left with the conclusion that the trial court properly dismissed the amended complaint as moot. By its terms, the annexation of land pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 709.16(B) was complete upon the journalization of the board approval of the annexation. It was undisputed that this occurred. Absent an injunction or order staying further action, the annexation proceedings had been completed. The land in question had already become part of the city and there was arguably nothing left but a moot case. It was apparent that the township had no authority to bring the action. Thus, dismissal of the complaint was correct as a matter of law. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pleaded guilty to the former and not guilty to the latter, but was subsequently found guilty on the premeditated murder charge. While an inmate, defendant filed a petition for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief alleging that his dual murder convictions violated his rights under the double jeopardy clause and the lower court dismissed the petition on the ground of res judicata. On appeal, defendant asserted that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.01 (1966), under which he was charged, was unconstitutional and that he was twice put in jeopardy for the alleged killing of one person. The court held that res judicata barred defendant's claim concerning &sect; 2901.01 because his claim did not involve evidence outside the record and his failure to raise the claim on direct appeal constituted a waiver of the claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In March 1990, defendant was convicted of rape and sentenced to 5 to 25 years' incarceration. He subsequently filed a motion to vacate or set aside the sentence on the ground that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B) required the lower court to reduce his sentence when Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (1996) was enacted and altered the term of imprisonment for rape convictions. The lower court denied the motion. On appeal, the court held that Am. Sub. S.B. 2 (1996) did not require the lower court to reduce defendant's sentence. The court found that although Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.58(B) provided, inter alia, that if the punishment for any offense was reduced by statutory amendment, then such punishment, if not already imposed, should be imposed according to the statute as amended, &sect; 1.58(B) was not applicable because the lower court sentenced defendant and imposed penalty before Am. Sub. S.B. (2) (1996) revised the sentencing procedures. The court also found that Am. Sub. S.B.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On December 9, 1994, the insured was injured in a car collision, at which time she carried uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage through a policy issued by the insurer with a $ 50,000 underinsurance coverage limit. The insured obtained $ 12,500 from the other driver's insurer, but her damages exceeded her policy limit and the insurer paid her $ 37,500 pursuant to Am. Sub. S.B. 20. The insured filed a declaratory judgment action alleging that the insurer was required to pay $ 50,000. The lower court granted summary judgment to the insurer ruling that Am. Sub. S.B. 20 was controlling. On appeal, the court found that when the policy was renewed, the law provided that the insured was entitled to recovery up to the limit of her policy, to the extent that her damages exceeded the amount that the tortfeasor's insurer had already paid her and on October 20, 1994, Am. Sub. S.B. 20 superseded such rule and allowed recovery to the extent that the policy limit exceeded the amount paid by another insurer. The court held that the insured's cause of action accrued when she settled with the other driver's insurer, which occurred well after the effective date of Am. Sub. S.B. 20.</SPAN></P>

The board found that nine violations were committed. The trial court found that the veterinarian committed four violations of Ohio law with regard to his veterinary practice. On review, the court affirmed. The use of the drug on the cat fell below the acceptable standard of care.  Ohio Administrative Code Section 4741-1-03 required veterinarians to keep adequate medical records. The veterinarian used a shorthand method of recording medications, and no one reviewing the records would be able to tell precisely what medications or doses were given without recourse to other materials.  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4741.22, which allowed the board's hearing officer to assess costs of the hearing, was constitutional because the statute provided no financial incentive, either direct or indirect, which violated the right of due process as defined by the Ohio and United States Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

There was not a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different. Defendant also contended that his counsel was ineffective for failing to request the appointment of an expert in eyewitness identification and for failing to request a jury instruction. The court held that defendant did not show that his counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonable representation and that he was thereby prejudiced.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff employee filed an action in the district court (Ohio) against the defendant employer for an employment intentional tort. Pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6), the employer filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss, and the employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was injured, during the course of his employment, as he reached into the side of a pulley on a conveyor to remove a stone that had become lodged in the conveyor system. The employee contended that the trial court failed to apply the appropriate legal standard for determining an Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss, and misconstrued the concept of tortious intent as it related to employment intentional torts. The court noted that the trial court did not use the stricter standard for an intentional tort set forth in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2745.01, but, instead, relied upon the more liberal common law standard. The court held that even applying the common law standard, it agreed with the trial court that the amended complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to withstand scrutiny under Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6). The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, noting that the trial court found that the allegations set forth in the amended complaint at most, alleged either negligence or recklessness, but failed to support either reference or finding that the employer had knowledge that an injury to its employee was certain or substantially certain to occur.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that although the trial court used the incorrect standard for determining whether the employer committed an intentional tort, its decision to dismiss the complaint was not error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charges arose from allegations that defendant had sexual contact with his minor daughter. After a motion to suppress was overruled, defendant pleaded no contest to the charges. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in finding him to be a sexual predator. The court concluded that a sexual predator, as defined by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.01(E) meant a person who had been convicted of or pleaded guilty to committing a sexually oriented offense and was likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses. The court rejected defendant's contention, holding that clear and convincing evidence showed that defendant was likely to engage in the future in a sexually oriented offense. Like the trial court, the court placed primary emphasis defendant's denial of involvement. The court reasoned that the poor rate of successful treatment of sex offenders was well-documented. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that Ohio's Sexual Predator Statute was not unconstitutionally applied to defendant where defendant's conduct occurred prior to the effective date of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ohio's Sexual Predator Act (Act) was not effective when defendant was convicted but became effective while defendant was incarcerated. The state contended that the notification provisions were not applied retroactively because the statute regulated a future situation, that was, a defendant's propensity to re-offend. The court reversed the judgment that had found that the notification provisions were applied retroactively, holding that the trial court erred in finding that the notification provisions violated prohibitions against retroactive or ex post facto laws. The court rejected defendant's contention that there was a lack of sufficient evidence that he was a sexual predator, holding that clear and convincing evidence supported the finding that defendant was a sexual predator.The court reasoned that in concluding that defendant was a sexual predator, the trial court relied on the victim's young age and the pattern of abuse over a number of years.

Defendant contended that a new sentencing law was applicable to his case. The court concluded that because defendant was sentenced six years before the effective date of the statute, the terms of the new legislation were not retrospectively applicable to defendant. Defendant's individual sentence had not been increased; instead, the overall sentencing scheme had been modified. Therefore, the new sentencing laws afforded no relief whatsoever to defendant since he was both convicted and sentenced before the effective date of the new legislation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the court found that the student did not have an adequate remedy in law because the proceedings of the high school academic reinstatement committee were quasi-judicial and did not implicate the procedural safeguards of the Due Process Clause. The court held that the board of education had authority under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 3313.47, 3313.20(A) to enact school attendance policies but that by enacting an unreasonable policy, it had abused its discretion. The court found that the attendance policy's requirement that each student attain a 93 percent attendance rate to receive academic credit was unreasonable on its face because the policy (1) purported to make attendance a prerequisite for academic credit, which was tantamount to making attendance a part of the school's curriculum; (2) counted both excused and unexcused absences against the student for attendance purposes; and (3) failed to specify in the student handbook what extenuating circumstances would excuse a particular student's poor attendance rate, which allowed school officials leeway to arbitrarily and unreasonably punish a student.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted for aggravated burglary, rape, kidnapping, felonious assault, and theft, stemming from a home invasion. On appeal from his convictions for aggravated burglary, rape, and theft, defendant raised five assignments of error, which were each rejected. Defendant's contention that the trial court erred when it denied his Ohio R. Crim. P. 29(A) motion for acquittal of the theft charge was waived, and therefore overruled. The court also disagreed with defendant's argument that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for new court-appointed counsel and that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court held that the evidence before the trial court was sufficient to support the guilty verdicts. The court also ruled that the trial court did not err when it designated defendant as a sexual predator and based its decision on Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(B)(2)(c), (i) and (j). The trial court had sufficient evidence before it to satisfy the &quot;clear and convincing&quot; standard of proof required for its sexual predator finding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners sought relocation assistance after their receipt of compensation for the taking of their property. The award of relocation benefits was offset by the compensation awarded for the municipality's taking pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 163.51 et seq. The landowners appealed, asserting that the offset violated their constitutional rights. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment and overruled the landowners' assignment of error on appeal. Although the statutory procedure of the relocation assistance program raised serious equal protection concerns, the landowners' injury was in the offset to relocation assistance. That was not the decision from which an appeal was taken. Rather, the landowners appealed their compensation award, which posed no constitutional problem. Any error in the relocation award was therefore outside the scope of appellate review. The landowners were required to seek judicial review of the relocation assistance agency's decision to offset assistance by compensation.</SPAN></P>

Based on the insurer's denial of coverage, the insured and her mother's estate filed a declaratory judgment action against the insurer, claiming that they were entitled to underinsured motorists coverage. They also alleged that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insured and her mother's estate argued that the amendments to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3937.18 did not apply to the case because statutory changes occurring after an insurance policy was issued, and before renewal, should not be considered part of the contract. The insurer contended that the amended statute should be applied because a cause of action for underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits did not accrue until settlement was made with the tortfeasor's insurer. The court concluded that the insured's and her mother's estate's cause of action accrued after the effective date of the amendments to &sect; 3937.18. The court used the time when the claim for UIM coverage accrued because this was the date when the conditions precedent to UIM coverage were satisfied. The insured and her mother's estate next argued that under &sect; 3937.18, as amended, an insured could collect UIM benefits even if the policy limits of the insured's policy were equal to the tortfeasor's policy limits. The court agreed that the trial court erred in finding that recovery for UIM benefits was precluded. However, in the absence of the policy provision, the court could not determine what recovery was merited.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed and defendant made a motion to dismiss the appeal. The court found that because the State's appeal was not permitted as of right pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09(C)(2), defendant's motion resolved to a question of what authority, if any, provided the State with an appeal as of right regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 2950.09. The court held that the legislature's requirement of a civil standard in sexual predator hearings manifested an intent that the hearing mandated by &sect; 2950.09(C)(2) be civil, not criminal, in nature and denied defendant's motion to dismiss. Moving to the merits of the case, the court noted that subsequent to the trial court's judgment, it addressed the same constitutionality arguments in another case and found that the statute was constitutional, not violative of the constitutional prohibition against either ex post facto laws or retroactive application of laws.</SPAN></P>

The attorney asserted that the trial court erred in allowing the claim of fraud to reach the jury and argued that the trial court should have granted his motion for a directed verdict, or in the alternative, the trial court should have granted his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. On appeal, the court found that an expert for the group members testified that the statement regarding Pennsylvania residents holding Ohio stock was not true. The court also found that the record contained evidence to support that findings that the attorney acted with utter disregard and recklessness about the statement's falsity, that the representation was material, that he intended to have the members rely on his statement, that they were justified in their reliance, and that they were deprived of an interest in the stock.

P. 2907.92(E) on the admissibility of the suicide was proper because defendant failed to lay a foundation for the admission of the suicide and failed to show good cause for not requesting the hearing three days before trial. The court further held that pursuant to the rape shield law contained at Wash. R. Crim. P. 2907.92(E), the evidence could not be used to attack the victim's credibility because it did not relate to the victim's sexual activity with defendant. The court found that the victim's testimony that the rape occurred on a specific day during a camping trip that occurred in one of two summer months coupled with other evidence of the specific dates of the camping trip was sufficient proof of the date of the offense.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that &sect; 3937.18 was not an impermissible infringement of the constitutional rights of freedom of contract, equal protection and right to remedy.

Defendant asserted that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that the conditions of her probation were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court explained that it deferred to the jury on factual findings, especially in cases in which the witnesses' credibility was crucial. The evidence at trial showed that defendant had bred, kept, and sold dogs under inhumane conditions. She misrepresented the breeds of their dogs and the state of their health. She also failed to report the income she had received. The court held that the evidence supported the verdict. The court agreed that defendant's conditions of probation, which ordered her to forfeit all of her dogs and not just those she had abused, exceeded the penalty for the offense itself.

The court found that since defendant claimed that his threats were misinterpreted as such, evidence of other threats similar in nature toward the same intended victim was relevant under Ohio R. Evid. 404(B) to show an absence of mistake or accident. The court determined that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2921.05(B), the Ohio retaliation statute, was not void for vagueness because it included threats made to a third party likely to convey them to the intended victim, and the court concluded that the victim did not need to be expressly named because her identity was readily ascertainable by the recipient of the threats.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, an organization and a landowner, challenged a judgment from the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which, in their administrative appeal, granted summary judgment for appellee city and affirmed the city council's grant of a special use permit to a church, and, in their action for writ of mandamus, a declaratory judgment, and injunctive relief, granted summary judgment to appellees, the city and its planning commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A church sought a special use permit for a building for an emergency shelter for homeless women. The commission staff opined that the location did not conform to the group home requirement and exceeded the quota for group homes and similar facilities, and the commission approved the staff's recommendation granting a permit for an institution and waiving the five-acre site requirement of Toledo, Ohio, Municipal Code &sect; 1167.01(b)(7). The city council then passed an ordinance granting the permit and waiving the requirement. The organization and the landowner filed an administrative appeal against the city and an action against the city and the commission for a writ of mandamus and injunctive relief. On appeal from summary judgments for the city and the commission, the court held that: (1) the organization did not have standing to file an administrative appeal on behalf of its members, who were not directly affected by the decision; (2) the city council could only grant a special use permit subject to the requirements of &sect; 1167.01(b)(7), and it could not waive the five-acre or any of the other requirements thereunder; and (3) hence, the ordinance granting the waiver was illegal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to one of five counts of an indictment, for drug trafficking (less than one gram) with a schoolyard specification. The trial court ordered that defendant's sentence be served consecutively to his existing term on two prior convictions, noting that defendant had had a flurry of criminal activity in the trial court in a few years' period, with prior arrests, convictions, and terms of incarceration. Defense counsel did not object to the consecutive sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that it was highly unlikely that defendant's sentence would have been different had he objected or had the trial court specifically mentioned Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2929.14(E)(3), which provided for consecutive sentencing on certain findings, on the record, or in its journal entry. The court reasoned that because defendant did not object at sentencing the court had to apply the plain error analysis of Ohio R. Crim. P. 52(B), and the court found no such error where the record clearly reflected the trial court's concern over defendant's criminal history.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for two counts of rape. Fifteen years later, the trial court adjudicated defendant to be a sexual predator pursuant to H.R. 180, whose provisions amended prior state law; however, the trial court held that the classification and notification provisions of H.R. 180 were unconstitutional as applied to defendant, who had been convicted prior to their enactment. The State appealed as to the holding that such provisions were unconstitutional. The court held that the State's appeal was without merit because it was unnecessary. The court, in a prior opinion, had already held that the classification and notification provisions of H.R. 180 were neither punitive nor substantive; further, as applied to offenders convicted prior to their enactment and still in prison, such provisions did not violate either federal ex post facto laws or the state prohibition against retroactive legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In April 1994, defendant was found guilty of one count of rape without force of a five-year-old and sentenced to 6 to 25 years of imprisonment. In July 1994, defendant pled guilty to two counts of gross sexual imposition in cases involving children under the age of 10. The trial court found that defendant was a sexual predator. The court determined that the trial court based its decision upon, among other factors, the fact that defendant was convicted in one way or another of committing sex offenses with five different children in two years. The court explained that the trial court cited evidence that defendant had never fully recovered from the frontal lobe injury to his brain, a condition, which in males tended to manifest itself in aberrant sexual misconduct from time to time. The court found that there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial court's determination that defendant was a sexual predator. The court concluded that it had previously overruled and rejected each of the arguments raised by defendant challenging the constitutionality of the sexual predator statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2950.09.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his adjudication as a sexual predator pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950. Defendant was previously convicted of two counts of rape of a person under 13 years of age pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.02. He was sentenced to serve 10 to 25 years' incarceration on each count, with 10 years' actual incarceration to be served consecutively. Defendant also had a previous conviction for sexual battery pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.03 that also involved a victim under 13 years of age. The court affirmed, rejecting defendant's contention that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 2950 was unconstitutional. The court also held the trial court's judgment finding him to be a sexual predator was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. After reviewing the record, the court held the trial court had sufficient evidence before it to produce a firm belief or conviction that defendant was likely to commit another sexual offense.
