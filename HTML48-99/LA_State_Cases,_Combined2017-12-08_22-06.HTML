</DIV>

The malpractice claim had already been held without merit by a state panel review held pursuant to the Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.41 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient filed a malpractice suit against defendants, a dentist she had consulted with on an emergency basis, and his insurer. In accordance with the Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat.

The patient alleged that the dentist she had first visited committed malpractice. The review panel concluded the evidence did not support her claim. In the trial court, the dentist's insurer was granted a directed verdict on the basis that no evidence was presented relative to coverage of the dentist under its policy. The jury returned a verdict for the dentist. The court affirmed the trial court judgments, stating that the pre-suit medical review panel requirement of &sect; 40:1229.47 furthered the legitimate state interest of encouraging the availability of affordable health care to its citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Criminal Judicial District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Section I (Louisiana), that convicted him of contributing to the delinquency of a minor in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:92, arguing that the trial court erred in admitting hearsay statements into evidence, that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, and that the trial court erred in imposing sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asked his neighbors' 10-year-old son on a fishing trip as a pretext to a sexual act. He was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:92, and he appealed his conviction and the sentence imposed. In affirming the conviction, the court concluded that, although the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay statements where the victim's father repeated the story told to him by his son, this error was harmless where the victim himself testified and provided much more detail than did the hearsay statements. Furthermore, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The testimony established that defendant attempted to put his hands inside the victim's pans and that the defendant told the victim that he would not take him home unless he had sex with the defendant. These actions certainly fell within the scope of &quot;enticing&quot; the victim to &quot;perform a sexually immoral act.&quot; In reversing the sentence imposed, however, the court concluded that it was error to give an indigent defendant a term of imprisonment in lieu of a fine when to do so resulted in a term of imprisonment that exceeded the statutory maximum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed, but his sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded to the trial court for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee wife filed a petition seeking partition of community property which she owned with appellant husband. The Twenty-Fourth District Court for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana) ordered a partition by licitation and denied certain claims which appellant intervenors made for reimbursement from the wife and husband's community assets. The husband and two intervenors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A husband and wife were legally separated in 1977 and divorced in 1979 and, shortly thereafter, the wife filed a petition for partition of the community assets. Trial was held on the merits of the wife's petition and judgment was rendered ordering a partition by licitation. However, that judgment was declared null and void and the case was decided by a judge who succeeded the first judge, but solely on the record created when the case was originally tried. On appeal from the second judgment, the appellate court held that (1) because the second judge decided the case using only the record of trial, the appellate court would make an independent review of the evidence; (2) because the community estate was terminated in 1977, the appellate court would decide the case under the law regarding partition of community property that was in effect prior to the effective date of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2801; and (3) the second judge properly ruled that partition by licitation was the only way the family home could be divided and properly denied claims against the community estate made by parties who allegedly made loans to the husband.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, convicted defendant of armed robbery and sentenced him to 50 years at hard labor, the first 10 to be without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The conviction was affirmed and the sentence was set aside. On remand, defendant was sentenced to 50 years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant contended his due process rights were violated when the trial court resentenced him and imposed a harsher sentence than the previous illegal sentence. The instant court found that prior to the initial sentence, the trial judge complied with the guidelines of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 but the sentence was illegal in that it limited defendant's 50-year sentence to only 10 years without probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The illegal aspect of the original sentence was illegal per se and could never have been carried out. Accordingly, the original de facto sentence was for 50 years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Thus, the resentencing was not more severe than the original sentence. Further, there was no possibility of vindictiveness or retaliatory motivation as the State moved to correct the illegal sentence prior to any decision from the reviewing court. The correction of the sentence was not the result of defendant's exercise of his right to appeal. The instant court concluded that the resentencing was nothing more than a duplicate of the original sentence without the illegal aspect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resentencing was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners appealed from the denial of their request for a declaratory judgment declaring La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:491 to be unconstitutional, by the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of Vermilion, State of Louisiana, regarding an obstruction and blockage of an alleged public road.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment granted a permanent injunction prohibiting the property owners from erecting or maintaining a fence, gate, or barrier across a street and prohibited the owners from interfering with work by appellee, the Vermilion Parish Police Jury, or with free access down the street. The appellate court held that the street at issue became a public road by virtue of the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:491. The trial court properly credited the testimony of three parish employees. The appellate court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court in its evaluations of the witnesses' credibility. The annual maintenance of the street by the police jury, coupled with the fact that the road had been laid out by the police jury, was sufficient to make the road public by tacit dedication under the provisions of &sect; 48:491. The owners' contention that &sect; 48:491 was unconstitutional because the statute provided for a &quot;taking&quot; without due process of law and without just compensation was rejected. The trial court disbelieved the evidence presented by the owners regarding their ignorance of police jury maintenance and work on the road.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ordinance 1 taxed and regulated roadside vendors such as the taxpayer. The record showed that numerous complaints were made by merchants and consumers about such vendors as well as by motorists concerning traffic congestion caused by vendors. The taxpayer claimed that the ordinance placed an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce, and thus violated the Commerce Clause. The appellate court disagreed; the only activity that was taxed or regulated was the sale of merchandise within the parish. That the taxpayer may have bought his merchandise in another state was immaterial for Commerce Clause purposes. Governing bodies were accorded wide latitude to regulate their local economies under their police powers, and, even discriminatory laws would not be overridden, if any set of facts reasonably justified the ordinance. The police jury could have determined that the ordinance would ameliorate congested traffic and protect consumers; moreover, no fundamental rights or suspect classifications were involved. The ordinance's language was not vague, and there was no showing that the ordinance was susceptible to selective enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third Judicial District Court, Parish of Lincoln (Louisiana), entered a judgment dismissing the plaintiff claimant's suit to establish the filiation of his father to his grandmother, and to receive his grandmother's one-third interest in the succession of the claimant's great-grandfather after it found the claimant failed to prove the filiation by clear and convincing evidence. The claimant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence showed a certain man and woman married before the beginning of the 20th century. They had three children. The only daughter became involved with a man. An illegitimate son, the claimant's father, was born to the relationship. The daughter, the claimant's grandmother, died many years later. At the trial to show the father's filiation to the grandmother, the claimant presented the testimony of two elderly relatives well acquainted with the claimant's grandmother and her family. They both testified that the illegitimate child, the father, was the natural child of the grandmother, although the two witnesses were confused as to the exact dates that certain events had occurred. The trial court ruled the claimant did not prove the filiation of the father to the grandmother by clear and convincing evidence. After the claim was dismissed, the appellate court found the filiation statute was constitutional and, as a procedural statute, operated retroactively to claims filed before its amendments went into effect. It also found the claimant proved the filiation and his right to part of the succession of his great-grandfather's estate by clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and judgment was rendered that found the claimant established the maternal filiation of his father to the claimant's grandmother. Judgment was also rendered that placed the claimant in possession of all the property of the claimant's grandmother and the claimant's father, including, but not limited to, an undivided one-third interest in and to the estate of the claimant's great-grandfather.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nurse was charged with being &quot;unfit or incompetent&quot; as a registered nurse because she illegally obtained Morphine from the narcotic cabinet at the hospital where she worked and she illegally disposed of unused portions of Morphine and Demerol. The board found sufficient cause to take disciplinary action against the nurse and to suspend her from practicing for six months. The district court, as a reviewing court, found that the board's actions were not arbitrary or capricious. Contrary to the nurse's contention, the court was not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the board when the board's decision had a rational basis and was supported by sufficient relevant and admissible evidence. Contrary to the nurse's argument, the court refused to prescribe a limitations period in which the board had to bring its actions. The court stated such argument should be made to the state legislature. Lastly, the court held that the Nurse Practice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:911 et seq., was not unconstitutionally overbroad or vague and the nurse was accorded sufficient notice of the charges against her to meet the requirements of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted of cruelty to a juvenile, her seven-year-old son. Abuse to various parts of the son's body was documented by his teacher and child protection investigators, who had placed the child in foster care. Defendant had pled not guilty. The trial court sentenced defendant to a term of 10 years imprisonment at hard labor. Defendant appealed. The court held that defendant's constitutional right to confront witnesses against her was not infringed where the trial court judge had her son testify by videotape in a separate room from defendant as though the child was sitting in the courtroom. The jury and the public could see and hear the child through a closed-circuit television monitor placed appropriately in the courtroom. The court found no abuse of discretion by the trial court judge by undertaking this arrangement where defendant would be granted any required conferences with her counsel. The court held that defendant's sentence was not grossly disproportionate or excessive, and was within the discretion of the trial court, given the serious harm caused defendant's son and the likelihood defendant's conduct would recur.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant nursing board filed a writ of certiorari from a decision of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) overruling its objections of prescription and lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Plaintiff medical society argued that a nursing board rule authorized nurse practitioners to practice medicine in contravention of the Medical Practice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1261 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a medical society was entitled to proceed with its declaratory judgment action concerning the validity of a nursing board rule establishing the position of nurse practitioner. The medical society complained that the nursing board rule authorized nurse practitioners to practice medicine in contravention of the Medical Practice Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:1261 et seq. The court held that the nursing board's exceptions were properly overruled. The medical society challenged the constitutionality of the rule and the authority of the nursing board to create such a rule. The nursing board contended that the 30-day time period contained in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:964(B) governed, and that the medical society's right to judicial review had prescribed. The court rejected that argument, and held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:963, the provision for judicial review of the validity of rules, contained no time limit for challenging the constitutionality of an administrative rule. This was consistent with the public's right to challenge a law at any time on the basis of its constitutionality or the scope of statutory authority. The medical society's action was timely filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court recalled a writ and remanded the matter. The court held that a medical society was entitled to proceed with its action for declaratory judgment concerning the validity and applicability of a nursing society rule, and the exceptions raising objections of prescription and lack of subject matter jurisdiction were properly overruled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A member of the university board of supervisors (member) entered into two contracts with the university for rental of advertising space and for sale of products. The state Commission on Ethics for Public Employees found that the member violated the state ethics laws and ordered that the contract be voided.

The court held that the member violated state ethic laws by receiving a salary from the university while entering into contracts with the university and had actively participated in the contract decision while being a member of the board of supervisors. The court also determined that the advertising contract would be voided due to the member's participation in its execution. Finally, the court concluded that the member did not violate state ethics laws by entering into the contract for the sale of products, because his winning bid was the lowest sealed bud, and he did not participate or assist in the procurement of the bid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' daughter fell off a slide which was located in a park owned by the city. They brought an action seeking recovery for personal injuries and the trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment based on the immunity contained in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2795. The court noted that the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 9:2795, which was raised by the parents, was not necessary to be determined because it found summary judgment inappropriate on other grounds. The court reversed the summary judgment, holding that the immunity contained in &sect; 9:2795 did not contemplate this type of injury. The court noted that the immunity was meant to extend to conditions of the true outdoors and to undeveloped, non-residential properties.

The trial court denied them recovery and dismissed the proceedings, finding that the provision which allowed a lump sum payment to a non-dependent parent created a class of beneficiaries that violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States and Louisiana Constitutions. Accordingly, the trial court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1231 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court did not reach the merits, finding that jurisdiction over an appeal where a statute was declared unconstitutional was in the Louisiana Supreme Court. Accordingly, the court transferred the matter for proper appellate review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from convictions of obscenity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106, a film distributor argued the statute was unconstitutional as allegedly disparate treatment violated their right to equal protection of the law in the exercise of First Amendment rights. The court held that the statute provided pre-arrest adversary hearings, but only for purveyors of material that did not contain the explicit depictions described by the statute. Sellers who were entitled to a hearing could be prosecuted only if they persisted in the prohibited conduct after the court declared their materials obscene. In contrast, sellers of materials which contained the described sexual depictions could be prosecuted without a pre-arrest adversary hearing. The court held the statute represented a reasonable means of protecting the public from obscene materials while at the same time safeguarding constitutionally protected expression. Because a pre-arrest adversary hearing was not constitutionally required and because states had broad powers to regulate obscenity, the legislature was free to achieve its purposes by any rational procedures, including exceptions to the hearing provision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with and convicted of two counts of attempted first degree murder. He appealed his conviction and sentence. In affirming the conviction, the court concluded the evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of attempted first degree murder. After shooting the first victim in the dining room, defendant proceeded to fire a second shot at the second victim in the kitchen and then fired three more shots at both victims at close range in the same room as one victim knelt over the other. Although defendant claimed that the shots were accidental and denied having had a specific intent to kill either victim, his multiple firings of the shotgun at close range at both women in rapid succession constituted a series of inseparable acts manifesting his specific intent to kill more than one person during a single consecutive course of conduct. In setting aside the sentence and remanding for resentencing, however, the court concluded that the trial court erred in imposing imprisonment without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, as this was not permitted under the attempt statute,&nbsp;La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company provided residential living alternatives for mentally retarded individuals.

Approximately one week before construction was completed, the parish attempted to halt construction upon the claim that the building was not being constructed as per the approved plans. After a hearing, the trial court found that the company had failed to comply with La. Rev. Stat.

Accordingly, the trial court enjoined the operation of the home until the company complied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A motorist was proceeding along a road when a car driven by defendant pulled out of a gas station and struck the motorist's vehicle on the right front fender, causing a blowout of her left front tire.

The motorist proceeded on foot to a restaurant to confront defendant, who denied hitting the motorist, claiming that he only had a blowout. Subsequently, an officer arrived, investigated the accident, and cited defendant for hit and run. On appeal of defendant's conviction, the court held that the evidence fully supported the finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Where no formal estimate of damage was introduced at trial, the court set aside the amount of restitution awarded. In sentencing defendant, the district court, after imposing a six month jail term, suspended the entire sentence, then sought to have defendant serve five days as a special condition of probation. The court held that the district court was without authority to make such a special condition of probation.</SPAN></P>

Those conditions were annulled and set aside and the case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fisherman was cited for violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:320 for taking commercial fish with non-approved traps. The department permitted fishermen to take any size catfish so long as the catfish was caught in slat traps which had one inch spacing. The trial court reasoned that if there was no minimum size limit for the length of fish caught then the specifications for slat traps could not be enforced and issued a permanent injunction against enforcement. The court noted that the suspension of the size limit meant that any fish in a fisherman's possession was a legal catch, while retention of the regulation on the traps ensured that enough sexually-mature channel catfish could escape the traps to propagate the species. Because the act was criminal in nature, the fisherman had to prove that the statute was a clear invasion of a property right, there was threatened irreparable injury and the statute was manifestly unconstitutional. Because the fisherman failed to meet that burden, the trial court erred when it granted the injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was error for the trial court to grant a permanent injunction of a criminal statute, therefore, the trial court's judgment was reversed and the injunction was set aside and annulled.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stabbed a bank employee and claimed that he perceived the victim to be a demon-like creature. Defendant's trial took place after a sanity commission declared defendant competent. On appeal the court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in limiting him in the direct examination of an expert witness. The court found that any error in the ruling was not reversible because it did not affect defendant's substantial rights. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in commenting on the evidence, but the court found that the remark did not imply an opinion as to defendant's guilt or innocence. The court also rejected defendant's assertion that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for continuance of the sentencing hearing. The court, however, found that the trial court erred in the imposition of the sentence. Although the court found no error in the imposition of the 10-year sentence, the court concluded that the trial court erred in the imposition of the fine. The fine violated the one-year limit of La.

Defendant applied for a writ of review contending that the ordinance under which he was convicted was unconstitutional because of vagueness and overbreadth. The court found that the ordinance was not void for vagueness because the words as used in the context of the criminal ordinance would be understood by a person of ordinary intelligence to include the conduct of which defendant was found guilty and would provide the trial judge with adequate standards for determining the guilt or innocence of an accused. However, the court held that where an ordinance, such as the one under consideration, swept broadly into areas protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, the proper disposition was to hold the ordinance unconstitutional on its face as overbroad. The court held that the ordinance was overbroad.

The court ruled that defendant's motion for a mistrial was properly granted, because he failed to specify what prejudicial material existed in either the edited or the unedited statement, which would warrant a mistrial.

On appeal the court set the sentence aside and remanded the case for resentencing. The court held that the State had the burden of proving that a defendant should be sentenced as a multiple offender, just as it had the burden of proving that a defendant should be sentenced as a single offender. The State did not carry its burden and defendant did not plead guilty to being a multiple offender. The court found that defendant had not pled guilty to being a multiple offender. He did nothing except admit that he was the same person, and in fact his lawyer objected to the multiple offender sentencing but was not given the opportunity to explain the basis of his objection. On remand defendant's counsel was to be allowed an opportunity to specify the grounds of his objection and the State was allowed to present evidence that proper Boykinization preceded the prior plea.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, licensed owner and trainer of quarter-horses, sought review of a judgment from the Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), that affirmed the racing commission's decision to suspend the owner's license pursuant to the absolute insurer rule under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:150(A) and L.AC. 11-6:53.18. .</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trainer appealed from a judgment of the trial court affirming the suspension of his license pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:150(A) and L.AC. 11-6:53.18. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the absolute insurer rule did not violate the due process clauses of the state or federal constitutions by creating an irrebutable presumption. The rule makes the trainer responsible for the condition of his horses. The court held that the rule did not violate the due process clause because it was reasonably related to the government's interests in insuring fair, safe races to protect the wagering public and to preserve the public's confidence in the integrity of the racing industry. Furthermore, strict regulation of the trainer by making him an absolute insurer is reasonable because the trainer is the person best able to guarantee the condition of the horses. Moreover, the court concluded that the trainer voluntarily applies for a license and by doing so subjects himself to certain terms and conditions such as the absolute insurer rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant approached the victim as she was getting into her car, pointed a gun at her head, and threatened to kill the victim if she resisted. He drove to a secluded area where he raped the victim vaginally and anally. Thereafter, he took her money and jewelry, ordered the victim out of the car, and drove away. Defendant was charged with and convicted of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated rape, and armed robbery. He appealed his conviction and sentence. In affirming, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the aggravated kidnapping conviction under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:44. The evidence revealed that the victim was forcibly seized and transported to another area where she was deprived of valuables. Although there was no direct evidence that defendant forced the victim to submit to his sexual demands as a condition of release, it was reasonable to infer that the defendant intended to release the victim only after raping her because that was in fact what occurred. Further, the sentence imposed on the robbery charge was not impermissibly excessive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trainer's horse finished fourth in a race, and tested positive for prohibited stimulants in its urine. The commission suspended his license for two years and fined him $ 500. He appealed and the trial court affirmed. He appealed the trial court's decision, contending that it was error not to remand for reconsideration of the penalty under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:964(G), and that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:155 violated the Louisiana Constitution. The court held that merely because &sect; 4:155 did not set out a specific penalty, it was not unconstitutional because any decision of the commission was subject to judicial review for abuse of discretion. The court reasoned that the flexibility of the statute allowed the commission to take in all the evidence and consider any surrounding circumstances. The court further held that the application of the statute did not violate due process and equal protection requirements, and affirmed the trial court's affirmation of the commission's findings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Twenty-fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which convicted him of armed robbery and sentenced him to 15 years at hard labor without the benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The trial court denied a motion to quash the bill of information based on a claim that defendant's speedy trial rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was free on bail and was not incarcerated awaiting trial. The overall period of time from his arrest to his trial was just over 10 months, during which time he filed, in addition to several requests for continuances, a motion to quash, which suspended time limitations pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 580. Thus, defendant was not unconstitutionally denied a speedy trial. On review of the record, the court concluded that the trial court took into account all of the testimony and evidence and found that the elements of armed robbery were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. There was no shifting of the burden of proof, as defendant suggested. While the statement of the trial court at the sentencing hearing did not constitute an articulate compliance with art. 894.1, an armed robbery conviction did not permit a suspended jail sentence, and a presentence investigation was not available to defendant as a matter of right. Further, the sentence was not grossly out of proportion to the offense. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its wide discretion in sentencing defendant because he was an admitted second offender, convicted of a serious crime while armed with a gun.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a decision granting summary judgment in favor of the Commission, the court reversed and remanded. The Commission adopted a formula for calculating pole attachment rates, which resulted in substantially higher rates than under a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) formula pursuant to 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 224(c). As a result of the increase, a number of cable companies filed an action questioning the authority of the Commission, under Louisiana law, to regulate pole attachment agreements. The cable companies contended that the Commission had no jurisdiction over cable companies and that the authority of the Commission to regulate public utilities did not include the authority to regulate pole attachment agreements. The court held that Louisiana law provided no express authority to the Commission to regulate the rates and terms of pole attachment agreements. La. Const. art. 4, &sect; 21 did not convey authority to the Commission to regulate these ancillary agreements which were not related to the function of the utility. Also, La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing where a dentist was represented by an attorney, the Board found that a dentist's advertising violated the Board's rules.

The dentist sought a rehearing in order to consider the constitutionality of the adjudications in light of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision. The court reinstated its prior opinion but amended it to the extent the that prior opinion indicated that the dentist claimed that the Board's regulations were unconstitutional. The record showed that the dentist's counsel merely stated that they, the dentist and his counsel, were not saying that they agreed that &quot;the statute&quot; was constitutional. That statement did not comply with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:963, which required the dentist to request a ruling from the board with respect to any alleged unconstitutional rules before the dentist could file a declaratory judgment action with respect to the validity of the rules.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 9:401-9:407 declared unconstitutional. The trial court granted the agency's exception of no cause of action and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court affirmed. The mother's vacillation and torment over her decision did not constitute a vice of consent that entitled her to annul the act of surrender. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9:401-9:407 were not violative of constitutional equal protection guarantees.The more stringent requirements in private adoptions, including legal representation at the time the parent executed the act of surrender and a period for the parent to revoke the act of surrender, had a rational basis. The differences in procedure between private and agency adoptions were founded on real distinctions and were not arbitrary or irrational.</SPAN></P>

The State's earlier summary judgment motion was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured person filed suit against the District Attorney's employee and the City of New Orleans to recover damages sustained in an auto accident. She later amended her petition to add the Orleans Parish District Attorney, asserting that the employee was in the scope and course of employee for the District Attorney when the accident occurred. The suit against the City was dismissed on summary judgment. The employee filed a suit against the State for indemnification. The employee filed a motion and rule against the State to show cause why he should not be granted attorney's fees, to which motion the District Attorney joined. The State appealed from judgment awarding attorney's fees, and the employee and the District Attorney answered, seeking an increase in fees. The court reversed and set aside the judgment and rendered judgment for the State. The court held that although he was driving his employer's car, the employee was not in the course and scope at the time of the accident because he was on his way to buy lunch. Hence, the employee was not entitled to indemnification under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5108.2(B).</SPAN></P>

Defendant pleaded nolo contendere to the charge, reserving the right to appeal the trial court's denial of a motion to quash. The trial court sentenced defendant to a term of imprisonment of two years at hard labor and imposed a fine. The court suspended imposition of the term of imprisonment and placed defendant on supervised probation requiring that 30 days be sent in the parish jail. Defendant appealed. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to quash, which was grounded on the basis that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67.1 did not provide a definition of &quot;domesticated deer,&quot; and thus was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court noted that U.S. Const. amend. VI and La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13 required that an accused be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him. The court held that the term &quot;domesticated deer&quot; afforded notice that livestock included tamed wild animals that were privately owned.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought a Class A retail beer permit to sell alcohol at a lounge.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:79-85 and was unconstitutional. Based upon a record consisting solely of stipulated facts, the trial court held that the permit had been unreasonably withheld and granted a writ of mandamus to the applicant compelling the police jury to issue the permit. On appeal, the court held that the trial court was not required to decide the question of the ordinance's constitutionality, even though the ordinance's language rather broadly prohibited the issuance of permits wherever the sale of beer would be &quot;offensive to the neighborhood, or apt to become a nuisance&quot; by being too near churches or schools. The police jury unreasonably denied the permit because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:280(C) prohibited the sale of beer only in locations within 300 feet of churches. No churches were within 300 feet of the applicant's lounge. However, mandamus was an improper remedy.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the widow submitted her claim the Office of Worker's Compensation Administration (OWCA), who then issued a resolution stating that the widow was entitled to death benefits. The insurer then mailed a rejection of the resolution. The district court ultimately entered summary judgment in favor of the widow. The court affirmed. Specifically, the court held the insurer, the interested party, received sufficient notice of the OWCA's resolution where notice was sent by regular mail. In addition, the court held that notice to the insurer's attorney was not constitutionally required. Furthermore, the court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1310.1 established a peremptive period; therefore, where the insurer's purported rejection of the OWCA's resolution came after the 30 day peremptive period had expired, its attempted rejection was without legal effect and it had forfeited its privilege to reject the resolution.</SPAN></P>

The Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), declared the name change action unconstitutional. Defendants appealed alleging La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of regents and the college and university board of trustees were both constitutional agencies of the state. La. Const. art. 5, &sect; 5(D) (1974), stated that a case was to be appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court if a law or ordinance had been declared unconstitutional. On its own motion, the appeals court addressed the issue of its jurisdiction to hear the defendants' appeal. The appeals court determined that it did not have jurisdiction under La. Const. art. 5, &sect; 10(A)(1), since La. Const. art. 5, &sect; 5(D), required that the appeal was to be heard directly and exclusively by the Supreme Court. In so deciding, the appeals court concluded, after a review of the history of &sect; 5(D), that the term &quot;ordinance&quot; as used in &sect; 5(D) included a motion that had been passed, or a resolution, of a state agency, such as the board of trustees. It was insignificant that the board trustees chose to designate their official actions as motions rather than resolutions or ordinances; their official action was in substance and effect an ordinance--it was an action intended to regulate their corporate affairs. It was substance, not form, which governed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his sentence was unconstitutionally excessive. Defendant's original sentence was identical to his enhanced sentence. The instant court found that the trial court was without jurisdiction to enhance defendant's sentence pursuant to the multiple offender statute because an order of appeal was previously granted. The instant court concluded that the record clearly supported the finding that the trial court adequately complied with the strictures of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1.There was no evidence of mitigating facts. Defendant knew exactly what he was doing and deliberately engaged in an unprovoked act of terrorism, which would very likely have resulted in this victim's death or serious injury, had defendant's deadly purpose not been thwarted by the actions of the witnesses in this case. Particularly noteworthy were the actions of defendant in forcing the victim to his knees, and making him beg for his life while defendant pointed a revolver at his head, after defendant had taken the victim's money. Given the circumstances, the original sentence imposed on defendant was not excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and original sentence were affirmed. Defendant's enhanced sentence as an habitual offender was vacated and set aside.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), treated a lawsuit filed by plaintiff police officers as a class action suit, and found unconstitutional defendant police department's administrative regulation and a companion regulation requiring police officers working a paid detail or outside employment to complete an authorization form. The police department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police department adopted regulations that stated that any police officers who wanted to work paid details or engage in outside employment had to complete an authorization form. It required that those who employed off-duty police officers assumed all liability for workers' compensation coverage. It also stated that the outside employer assumed all liability for costs incurred for the legal defense of the officer employed in the off-duty work. The police officers alleged that the regulations violated their constitutional rights. While the suit was pending, the form was revised to further indemnify the city. The trial court treated the suit as a class action and ruled that the regulations were unconstitutional. After the police department appealed, the appellate court found the regulations were unconstitutional as employers could only be held liable for workers' compensation relative to that portion of the salary they paid. It also found the city could only be held liable for the torts of its employees that were related to their duties for the city. However, it further found the necessary procedural requirements had not been met to proceed with the suit as a class action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">That part of the judgment holding the police department's administrative regulation and the companion regulation unconstitutional was affirmed.

Defendant drove off in his car, but returned 10 minutes later. The victim threatened to kill defendant and lunged at the car. Defendant shot the victim five times. In affirming defendant's manslaughter conviction, the court held that the jury's failure to find that defendant was provoked was immaterial, because provocation was not an element of the offense. The court also rejected summarily defendant's self-defense and sufficiency of the evidence issues. The court acknowledged error in the trial court's instruction to the jury regarding the mandatory minimum sentence for the offense. The court noted that the trial court failed to account for the enhancement for use of a firearm, which increased the minimum from five to seven years. But the court also noted that the trial court informed the jury of the maximum 21-year sentence, and held that the error was both inadvertent and harmless.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was confronted by police as he was fleeing from the scene of a shooting and shot one of the officers. He appealed his conviction for attempted first degree murder, arguing that his confession should have been suppressed, that his sentence was excessive, and that the firearms enhancement was improperly applied. In affirming, the court ruled that the evidence supported the trial court's findings that defendant had knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent and to have counsel present during his interrogation after the police had advised him of his rights and of the fact that an attorney had been appointed for him. The court also held that the record showed that the trial court carefully and fully considered the mitigating factor of defendant's mental condition, as well as the other criteria under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Sixth Judicial District Court, Parish of Madison (Louisiana), which convicted him on a jury verdict of indecent behavior with a juvenile and attempted indecent behavior with a juvenile. Defendant was to serve consecutive sentences of five years at hard labor, and one and one-half years at hard labor, plus a fine of $ 2,500 and costs, or service of one year imprisonment in lieu of the fine and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 51-year-old defendant picked up two 12-year-old boys, engaged in sexual acts with them, and then dropped them off. Defendant alleged that the sentences had to be served concurrently because the charges arose from a single transaction. The court pointed to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 833, which provided that consecutive sentences were proper where the trial court expressly directed so. The court found that the trial court supplied the necessary justification for consecutive sentences. Defendant had been convicted of numerous misdemeanors and had prior arrests for enticing minors into prostitution. The pre-sentence report noted complaints of defendant chasing little girls, harassing teenagers, and ordering a girl into his car with a firearm. In finding that the sentence was not excessive, the court noted that he did not receive the maximum, and that the trial court complied with art. 894.1. The sentence was not illegal because it imposed a fine with additional time if it was not paid. An indigent who did not pay a fine was subject to imprisonment for a longer term as along as the sentence did not exceed the maximum for the offense, pursuant to art. 884.</SPAN></P>

On review from an adverse decision, the relatives argued that their parents race designations were incorrect and that they were entitled to delayed birth certificates reflecting their true race. The court rejected the argument, holding that &sect; 42:267 had previously been held constitutional despite its repeal in 1983 and that the relatives had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that their race was incorrect or that those without birth certificates had been denied their issuance. The court reasoned that &sect;42:267 was irrelevant to the issuance of a writ because the initial racial designations were not made by a public official, but were made by a midwife or by the parents themselves unaided by the criteria of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow appealed the ruling from the Civil District Court for Orleans Parish (Louisiana) granting defendant employer's plea of prescription to her action seeking worker's compensation benefits for the wrongful death of her husband due to an occupational disease (asbestosis). The widow contended that the district court erred in holding that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23: 1031.1(1980) her action was not revived.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow's husband died in 1977. At that time, the prescriptive statute for worker's compensation benefits for an occupational disease provided for a six-month limit from the date of death. In 1980, the legislature amended &sect; 23:1031.1(1980) to provide that the six month limitation expired from the date the claimant had reason to believe death was caused by an occupational disease. In 1983, the widow filed an action that was dismissed on the employer's plea of prescription. On review, the employer argued that the statute at the time of death provided for prescription within six months and that it had a right to rely on prescription as a right at that time. The widow argued that the passage of &sect; 23:1031.1(1980) had revived her cause of action. The court, after a careful analysis of the theory of prescription and its retroactive application, rejected the widow's argument. The court found that the legislature did not intend to revive actions that had otherwise prescribed under the old statute and that if such a retroactive application was intended, it would have been stated in the statute.</SPAN></P>

The statutes were a rational way to protect Louisiana cable businesses, which either relayed a signal through ground cable or by microwave transmission, from the unauthorized interception by the use of various devices.

The court distinguished cases relied upon by the homeowners, pointing out that the Act was not compulsory and did not require them to secure a bond from the contractor to protect the lumber company. The Act permitted them to do so in order to protect themselves from claims such as the one at bar. Therefore, the Act did not deprive them of equal protection of the law. Nor did the filing of the materialman's lien without prior notice or a hearing, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:4822, deprive the homeowners of their Fourteenth Amendment rights to procedural due process of law, because there had been no taking of a significant property interest. Also, because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:304(C) required the lumber company to collect sales taxes, it should not have to bear the cost of the taxes on materials sold and used at the homeowners' property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been convicted of six counts of DWI over six years.

In reversing those convictions, the court held that defendant could not be convicted of fourth offense DWI when there was no bill of information charging that crime. The court stated that the subsequent filing of an amended bill did not cure this defect. The court further found that the conviction for third offense DWI must be reversed because the State had stipulated that the two predicate offenses did not show Jones compliance.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were not entitled to a jury trial pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13:5105, which prohibited jury trials for suits against the state or state agencies. The parish was negligent pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32:235(B), as the parish had constructive knowledge that a stop sign had been missing from the intersection two weeks prior to the accident and did not remedy it. The DOTD was also negligent because it had assumed responsibility for placing and maintaining stop signs at intersections. The failure to replace the stop sign was a breach of the state's duty to protect the public against risks caused by improper signing. Defendants were liable because the responsibilities of each were to intertwined. The decedent was not contributorily negligent, as she was unfamiliar with the intersection, was entitled to assume that the roadway ahead was safe for travel, and had no duty to guarding against the defective intersection.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected defendant's argument that a jury composed of persons who would consider the imposition of the death penalty resulted in a jury biased in favor of the prosecution because the exclusion of &quot;death-qualified&quot; jurors did not deny defendant his constitutional right to an impartial jury, as voir dire culled from the venire those who demonstrated they could not be fair to either side of the case. The trial court did not err by admitting into evidence photographs of the victims' bodies and the bloody crime scene because they were relevant and the probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect. The trial court properly denied defendant's request for a change in venue pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 622 because the media coverage was neither extensive, nor inflammatory.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with aggravated battery.

The court held that defendant's objection to the use of the inculpatory statements and his allegation that physical evidence was seized without a warrant alleged all the facts necessary to entitle him to an evidentiary hearing under La.

The court held that the motion made the factual allegations required by law to establish a right to suppression even though the factual details of the circumstances surrounding the warrantless seizure and the alleged involuntary statements following an illegal arrest were not as factually specific as the State preferred.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court amended defendant's sentence.

On review, defendant argued that the ordinance was invalid because of its inconsistency with state law, specifically La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98. The court found merit in this contention and reversed. According to the court, the ordinance did not incorporate the same standards or elements of driving while intoxicated as contained in &sect; 14:98. For a defendant charged under &sect; 14:98, a blood alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more established guilt.

Defendant was sentenced to six months in the parish jail on the theft charge, and two years at hard labor on the attempted burglary charge, to be served consecutively.

The court held that the judge properly complied with the criteria under art. 894.1.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant placed his two-year-old in a bathtub and turned on the hot water for the purpose of punishment. Defendant held his son in the tub while the hot water ran over the child, causing second-degree burns over 20 percent of the lower part of the boy's body. After inflicting the burns, defendant failed and refused to take his son to a hospital until the following day. Defendant pled guilty to the offense of cruelty to a juvenile in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:93, and was sentenced to 10 years at hard labor. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court failed to properly consider and apply the sentencing guidelines of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The court affirmed the conviction, but vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. The court held that the sentence imposed by the trial court was unconstitutionally excessive in violation of La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20. The court held that the sentence imposed was out of proportion to the severity of the offense, that defendant was not among the most egregious or blameworthy of offenders, and the length of the sentence amounted to a needless and purposeless imposition of pain and suffering.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita, Louisiana, which, following his plea of guilty to attempted distribution of marijuana, sentenced defendant to three years at hard labor and imposed a $ 500 fine and court costs. In default of the payment, the trial court imposed 90 days imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the imposition of a $ 500 fine and court costs was unconstitutionally excessive. In sentencing defendant, the trial judge noted the seriousness of the offense and defendant's extensive criminal record. Although defendant pled guilty to attempted distribution of marijuana, the evidence would have supported a conviction for distribution of marijuana. Defendant could have received as much as 10 years at hard labor and a fine of up to $ 15,000 on the offense he was originally charged with. Consequently, defendant received a substantial benefit when the state allowed him to plead to a lesser offense. The trial court also noted that defendant was not eligible for probation. The maximum fine was $ 7,500; however, in imposing a $ 500 fine, the trial court adverted to the small amount of money involved and defendant's lack of drug-related convictions in the last several years. Considering the serious nature of the offense and defendant's prior record, the court found that defendant's sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's sentence of a $ 500 fine and court costs or imprisonment for 90 days in default of payment in addition to three years hard labor for attempted distribution of marijuana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ordered the victim, who was pregnant with his child, out of a car, dragged her by the hair into the woods, beat her, and had sexual intercourse with her after she complied in fear for her life. The court affirmed defendant's consecutive sentences of five years at hard labor for simple kidnapping, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:45, and three years in jail for simple battery, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34.1. The court held that the trial court correctly imposed the five-year sentence without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence based on its finding, which was in accordance with overwhelming evidence and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1, that a firearm was used in the commission of the simple kidnapping. The court held that defendant was not denied due process because art. 893.1 was not a separate offense and the State was not required to allege the use or possession of a firearm in the indictment before the trial court could use art. 893.1 to enhance the penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the manager of an alcoholic beverage outlet, appealed an order from the Civil District Court, Parish of New Orleans (Louisiana), which dismissed her claim that New Orleans, La., Mun. Code &sect; 5-20(1), was unconstitutional, and denied an injunction prohibiting defendant city from withholding renewal of her alcoholic beverage outlet manager's permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city denied renewal of the manager's permit based upon a finding that she lacked good character and reputation, a qualification required by &sect; 5-20(1). The city's decision was based upon her several recent arrests and pending charges against her for possession of narcotics and stolen property. The manager alleged that &sect; 5-20(1) was unconstitutionally vague, violated due process and equal protection guarantees, and violated La. Const. art. 6, &sect; 28. The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague, even though it did not define good character or reputation, and did not expressly require denial of a permit because of an applicant's arrest record. The required qualification of good character and reputation provided an ascertainable standard, and the requirement had a real and substantial relationship to promotion of orderly and legal distribution of intoxicating beverages. The ordinance was reasonable and not arbitrary and so satisfied due process. Applying the ordinance to deny a manager's permit to persons who had numerous arrests was not unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. The ordinance did not violate &sect; 28 because it was not a revenue measure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to possession of cocaine in excess of 400 grams and was sentenced by the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana) to 12 years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension. Defendant appealed the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant urged that his sentence should not have been imposed without benefit of parole. The trial judge found that defendant rendered substantial assistance to the prosecution in a co-defendant's case, and sentenced defendant to 12 years rather than 15. Defendant contended that because he was sentenced to 12 years under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967 G(2), the parole ineligibility portion of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967 F(3) did not apply. Also, defendant argued that if the trial judge had discretion to deny parole under &sect; 40:967 G(2), this section violated the separation of powers clause of the Louisiana Constitution of 1974, Art. 2, &sect; 2. The court disagreed. Concluding that defendant's argument that &sect;40:967 G(2) stood independently from the other penalty sections of &sect; 40:967 was without merit, the court held that the trial court could, if it found substantial assistance, reduce the sentence without necessarily adjusting or eliminating the parole ineligibility portion of the sentence. Thus, the trial judge could reduce from 15 the number of years to be served and at the same time require the sentence to be served without benefit of parole, suspension, or probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to selling one tablet of hydromorphone to an undercover police officer. The court upheld defendant's conviction for distribution of a controlled dangerous substance in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967A(1) and sentence of 17 1/2 years at hard labor. The court held that the trial court complied with La. Code Crim. Proc.

The court found that defendant's long history of criminal conduct, drug and alcohol abuse, reputation as an active member of the drug community, and possession of more than one hydromorphone tablet revealed more than an adequate factual basis for the sentence.

Defendant testified at the sentencing hearing that he had pled guilty to the charge of aggravated battery, an incident that occurred when he stabbed a man during an altercation in a nightclub. The evidence showed that defendant had prior offenses, including a conviction for either murder or manslaughter. The defendant's wife testified that the husband was involved in the care of their three children and that they would suffer from his imprisonment. Defendant's physician testified that defendant had psychiatric problems which contributed to the incident but that he was currently stabilized, but that he would benefit more from a mental health confinement. The court vacated the sentence on grounds that the trial judge failed to articulate, for the record, the considerations he took into account and the factual basis for imposing defendant's sentence, as required under La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the 11th Judicial District Court, Parish of Sabine, Louisiana, which sentenced him on his plea of guilty to attempted distribution of a counterfeit controlled dangerous substance, Schedule II, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(A)(2) to a term of 4 years at hard labor and fined him $ 5,000 and court costs, or on default to serve 1 year at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold what he claimed were 10 &quot;357 magnums,&quot; a street name for a controlled dangerous substance, to an undercover police officer. A lab report revealed that the pills were counterfeit. The court held that because the sentence imposed was in the upper range of the allowable sentence, and because the trial court failed to provide articulated reasons showing that defendant committed a particularly serious violation and that he was the worst kind of offender, the trial court's failure to comply with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 required that the high and apparently severe sentence be vacated. The court also held that the sentence, although within the statutory limits, was apparently severe in relation to the offender and the offense. The sentence was so grossly disproportionate to the severity of the offense as to be shocking to the court's sense of justice. Because defendant was indigent, the imposition of a fine that automatically converted into additional jail time might also have been improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's sentence for attempted distribution of a counterfeit controlled dangerous substance and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then patted his pockets, reached in his front right pocket and removed a .22 caliber 5 shot revolver. The trooper grabbed the revolver and told defendant he was also being charged with carrying a concealed weapon. The trial court found defendant guilty of carrying a concealed firearm on his person in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The group home sought to house six or fewer mentally retarded individuals in a residential area. The city-parish refused to issue an occupancy permit due to the group home's failure to comply with East Baton Rouge, La., Code &sect;&sect; 2.119 and 2.201, which required approval of 51 percent of the neighbors before such a home could be approved. The trial court granted the group home's request for a preliminary injunction enjoining the city-parish from enforcement of the ordinances. The court affirmed. Mentally retarded individuals were a &quot;quasi-suspect&quot; class and heightened scrutiny must have been used when reviewing laws discriminating against them. Under the heightened scrutiny standard the government's classification must have served an important governmental objective and had to have been substantially related to achieving that objective. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28:381(8) defined &quot;community home&quot; and provided that a community home which provided for six or fewer mentally retarded individuals was considered single family units.

Ann. &sect; 14:30.1, defendant asserted on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial after there was an outburst in the courtroom. The court held that when the conduct did not fall within the mandatory mistrial provisions, the judge had the discretion to determine whether the activity or comment was so prejudicial to the defendant that he could not receive a fair trial. The court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying a mistrial. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in refusing to allow proffered psychiatric testimony because the testimony was crucial to his manslaughter defense. The court held that, pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 651, evidence of a mental condition or defect was inadmissible when the defendant failed to plead not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. In addition, the court held that the exclusion of the evidence did not deprive defendant of a fair trial.

The dentist asserted that the restrictions were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dentist was charged with violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:775, which defined unprofessional conduct by a dentist. The dentist admitted that his advertisements violated the statute, but claimed that the regulations were an unconstitutional violation of his First Amendment rights. On review, the court noted that it had the authority to reverse an unconstitutional decision under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:964(G)(1) of the Administrative Procedures Act. The court found no merit in the dentist's assertion that his free speech rights were violated. The dentist directly violated a prohibition against mentioning a particular drug or anesthetic in an ad when he stated that he used nitrous oxide. He also committed a violation by claiming professional superiority. Finally, he advertised free dental services as an inducement. The dentist's case did not come within the narrow precedent allowing limited advertising regarding price. The court held that the state's desire to regulate the use of narcotics and sedatives was a compelling interest that justified restrictions on dental ads.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967, as charged by the State in a bill of information. The defense sought to suppress statements defendant made to immigration officials. Defendant was sentenced to 15 years at hard labor and fined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested when entering the country because the luggage he was carrying contained cocaine. It was then discovered that his passport was illegal. Defendant was charged with transporting drugs and was then questioned by an immigration officer. Defendant was read his rights and signed a waiver before talking to the officer. Statements that he made to the immigration officer were later used as evidence at his trial on the drug charge. The court held that the trial court had not erred by allowing the statements to be admitted as evidence. The state established that the immigration officer did not interrogate defendant on the drug charge, and no pressure was placed on the accused. The defense also claimed the testimony of one witness was prejudicial. However, no objection was made at trial, so the matter could not be reviewed on appeal. Further, the testimony of an immigration agent that was admitted for the limited purpose of circumstantially establishing that the defendant knew he was carrying drugs was relevant. The court, however, found that since the fine for possession of cocaine had been ruled unconstitutional, that portion of the sentence was to be set aside.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the fine that was imposed against defendant, but it affirmed the judgment and sentence of the trial court in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the trial court (Louisiana), which convicted him of two counts of attempted manslaughter in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:27, 14:31 and sentenced him to serve six years on each count. Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

Ann. art. 894.1, and that the sentences imposed were excessive. The court finalized defendant's judgment of conviction and affirmed his sentences, as amended, finding that the sentences imposed were less than the mandatory minimum. The court found that where there was no sentencing discretion involved in correcting an illegal sentence, it was immaterial whether the correction was effected by the trial court or by the appellate court. Accordingly, the court exercised it authority under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 882 and corrected defendant's illegal sentences by increasing them to the statutorily required minimum. Additionally, the court found that in consideration of the manner in which defendant's offenses were committed, the maximum sentence exposure, defendant's criminal record, and the reason for firearm enhancement statutes, the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

The cashier later identified defendant as the perpetrator in a line up, and defendant was convicted and sentenced for attempted armed robbery. On appeal, the court held that it was not error to deny a mistrial based on an amendment to the indictment to change the date of the offense because the date was not essential to the offense of attempted armed robbery. Proceeding forward with the trial after a recess of two days after the amendment of the indictment did not violate defendant's right against double jeopardy where defendant used the same witnesses as originally subpoenaed, and was not otherwise prejudiced. Where he failed to request a new trial, defendant waived his right to object to prosecutor statements referring to defendant as being the man at the scene of the crime and asking the jury to place themselves in the victim's position. A line up was not unduly suggestive where defendant testified that the men in a line up were similar to him in physical characteristics, and the cashier had no hesitancy in her identification.

The court held that &sect; 3:1634(2) was neither unconstitutionally vague nor overbroad. The claimant, as a certified applicator, was given adequate notice that aerial application of Azodrin in order to kill birds which were inhabiting a rice field would constitute a violation of the statute. The Azodrin label clearly stated that it was a restricted use pesticide and that it was deadly to birds and other wildlife. Because the claimant did not execute a timely appeal of the judgment finding him in violation, the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the former &sect; 3:1623.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper noticed the slow and erratic manner in which a truck was being driven and pulled the truck over.

Defendants then engaged in a conversation about the items that they had recently stolen in a burglary, not knowing that the conversation was being taped.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was shot and killed by two police officers. His estate and his siblings filed a suit for damages under state and federal law. The officers and officials filed an exception of no cause of action, which was maintained by the trial court.

The court found that because federal statutory law did not address the survival of a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim, who the injured parties were when the victim was killed, or the measure of available damages, resort had to be made to state law unless it was inconsistent with federal law. The court found nothing in La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315 that was inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States; thus, a cause of action did not exist in favor of the estate where the alleged deprivation of constitutional rights caused death. The court found that under art. 2315, the estate did not have a cause of action because it was not among the designated beneficiaries in the statute. The court noted that the siblings could not sue under art. 2315 because the decedent was survived by his father. The court found that constitutional authority did not permit decedent's siblings a cause of action under &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff heirs appealed a judgment from the Twenty-Fifth Judicial District Court, Plaquemines Parish (Louisiana). After plaintiffs filed a petitory action to recover four sections of land, the trial court sustained an exception of acquisitive prescription filed by defendants, a board of levee commissioners and companies holding leasehold interests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs' ancestor settled the disputed land during the reign of the Spanish sovereign. The Louisiana purchase subsequently incorporated the land into the United States. After a federally commissioned survey erroneously represented the ancestor's land, the ancestor filed a private claim, and his corrected claim was included in a report to Congress. Congress confirmed the ancestor's ownership in 1842. Plaintiffs filed a petitory action to recover the land. The trial court sustained defendants' exception of acquisitive prescription. The court affirmed. The ancestor's claim arose from possession and occupancy of the land and was incomplete when the land was ceded to the United States. The right possessed by the ancestor was equitable until confirmation, at which time titled vested in the ancestor. The court rejected plaintiffs' argument that the heirs did not acquire title to the subject tract of land until the United States issued a patent to them in 1972. Title passed from the United States to the ancestor in 1842 when the private claim was confirmed, not in 1972 when the United States issued a patent to the heirs. Accordingly, prescription began to run from 1842, not 1972.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that defendants had acquired acquisitive prescription of the land.</SPAN></P>

The inter vivos donation and the legacy were declared to be invalid under La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 1489 and 1491. In affirming the decision, the court stated that under La. Civ. Code Ann art. 1489, there were two important exceptions to the general prohibition against donations to doctors treating the deceased during the last illness. The first exception was remunerative donations. The court held that the doctor was paid for his services rendered because he had submitted a detailed statement showing the dates and charges for house calls made for over a year prior to her death. Further, the exception of a universal disposition in case of consanguinity did not apply because it was not a universal disposition. The disposition was a specific bequest of decedent's house and dining room furniture. Finally, the donation to the doctor's wife was not remunerative in nature as a result of the wife providing friendship and counseling to decedent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgage creditor filed suit against the mortgage debtor to recover the alleged indebtedness together with interest, cost, and attorney's fees. Subsequently, the parties settled as to the principal, interest, and cost. While the issue was pending, the Louisiana Legislature passed Act 483 of 1983, which provided that attorney's fees stipulated in a promissory note are collectible. As a result, a determination was made that the Act was retroactive and judgment was rendered in favor of the mortgage creditor for the full amount stipulated for attorney's fees. In affirming the decision, the court held that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1935 as amended by Act 483 was curative of its past disabilities and was to be retroactively applied. Further, it did not fall within the general rule of prospective operation because it was curative and was entitled to retrospective application. In addition, the issue of the unconstitutionality of Act 483 of 1983 could not be reached because no assertion of unconstitutionality was pled prior to the brief filed in the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee resigned from his position with the State when he was 49 years old. The employee had elected to extend the insurance coverage to his spouse, as permitted under the insurance program rules of the State. Although vested with retirement benefits, he could not receive the benefits until he reached 55 years of age. Subsequent to his resignation, but prior to the time he became eligible to receive retirement benefits, the board of trustees adopted a resolution to define &quot;retiree&quot; for purposes of insurance benefits program eligibility. The board of trustee's action excluded from eligibility those persons such as the employee. The employee sought a judicial determination of the validity of the board of trustee's action. The lower court granted a judgment in favor of the employee that ordered the board of trustee to allow the employee to enroll in the insurance benefits program. On appeal the court held that the board of trustees in adopting the resolution that defined &quot;retiree&quot; improperly attempted to exclude the employee from receiving insurance benefits and therefore had exceeded its authority granted by La.

In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the trial court did not err in its holding that the commission could not consider the independent fair market appraisal offered by the taxpayer to challenge an assessment. The court stated that the commission may not usurp the authority of the assessor under La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 18(D) (1974) by utilizing factual data that was available to the taxpayer, yet withheld from the assessor. The court also rejected the taxpayer's contention that the trial court erred in failing to require that all property be valued as of a common date. The court found that the methods employed by the assessor did not result in a valuation of the taxpayer's property in excess of its value for the assessment year in question, and that the assessments were valid under La.

He was charged by bill of information with possession of a controlled dangerous substance (cocaine) with intent to distribute, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967-A(1).

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court opined that whatever exigency might have existed as to the original warrantless entry into defendant's home and his arrest was likely created by the government, and therefore could not justify the entry. The situation did not appear to have required prompt action. However defendant failed to raise as an issue any claim that the information contained in the affidavit supporting the search warrant, which subsequently issued, was derived from the illegal entry. Excising the information derived from the illegal entry and arrest, which was included in the affidavit for the search warrant, the court found that the affidavit contained sufficient information to establish probable cause supporting issuance of the warrant. Therefore, the court found that the search warrant was valid and the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant was properly admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

Defendants brought appeals. The issue on appeal was whether defendants were improperly sentenced under an unconstitutional statute,&nbsp;&sect; 56:34. On review, the court vacated the sentences. The court held that &sect; 56:34 was unconstitutional under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 insofar as &sect; 56:34 provided no maximum fine. The court held that &sect; 56:34 was valid in all other respects where &sect; 56:34 contained a severability clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held partly in favor of defendants and partly against defendants. The court affirmed the convictions of defendants, affirmed the trial court's ruling that denied defendant's motion to quash, vacated and set aside the sentences that the trial court had imposed upon defendant, and remanded the cases for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Fourteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), wherein he was resentenced. Defendant had pled guilty to various drug charges and was originally sentenced by the district court. The court, in a prior appeal in the case, had affirmed the sentences. The state supreme court had remanded the case for resentencing. In the instant appeal, defendant again attacks his sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant urged that the fines imposed as part of his resentencing, which totalled $ 30,000, were cruel, unusual or excessive within the meaning of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, as the fine was grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime and to other sentences imposed in like cases. The court vacated defendant's sentences and remanded the case to the district court for resentencing in accordance with the views expressed by the court. The court found that the fines totaling $ 30,000 were unconstitutionally disproportionate and cumulatively excessive. At the time, a study of the fines previously imposed by the district court reflected that the largest fine imposed for drug offenses was $ 10,000. Further the court observed that the district court had made unwarranted assumptions in resentencing defendant as reflected in its statements. Also, the district court's reference to community attitudes suggested that the sentencing in fact had not been individualized as required by law. Finally, the district court improperly had assumed that defendant was able to pay the fines and had intended that they fall not on defendant alone, but also on his family.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's sentences and remanded the case to the district court for resentencing in accordance with the views expressed in the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted the following assignments of error: (1) the trial court imposed an illegal sentence when it ordered that defendant be denied the benefit of good time; (2) the trial court erred in imposing an excessive sentence. The court rejected both claims and affirmed defendant's sentence. Whether or not to allow the defendant good time was within the discretion of the trial court, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:571.3(C). An amendment to &sect; 15:571.3, which made the granting of good time mandatory not discretionary in certain instances, did not take away the court's discretion when the statutory criteria were not met, as in defendant's case. Furthermore the sentence, which was within the maximum sentence permitted for second or habitual offenders under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, did not violate La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20's prohibition of excessive punishment. Defendant was a second offender, and the 25-year sentence was not excessive in light of his past criminal activity. Finally, in imposing sentence, the trial court considered both mitigating and aggravating circumstances, and so complied with the requirements of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant asserted that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of the crime charged and that the trial court imposed an excessive sentence. The court held that it could not review the sufficiency of the evidence because defendant had failed to designate the portions of the trial record necessary for review. Concerning the sentence imposed, the court noted that the maximum sentence for the crime was five years at hard labor. Defendant argued that the sentence was nevertheless excessive because his codefendants received more lenient sentences after accepting a plea bargain. The court held that a sentence greater than one received by another defendant for the same crime did not make the sentence cruel and unusual. The court affirmed the judgment because it found that the sentence imposed was not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Winnsboro, La. Ordinance 3-12 provided that no permit should be granted any premises situated within 300 feet or less of a public play ground or of a building used exclusively as a church, or synagogue, public library, or school. With respect to beverages of high alcoholic content the measurement of the distance was be made from the nearest point of the property line of the church, synagogue, library, playground, or school to the nearest point of the property line of the premises to be licensed. With respect to beverages of low alcoholic content, this distance was to be measured as a person walked, using the sidewalk from the nearest point of the property line of the church, or synagogue, library, play ground, or school to the nearest point of the premises to be licensed. The court held that, regarding the liquor license, the distance was properly measured, but that, for purposes of the beer license, the measurement had not been made according to law. There was a rational basis for making the distance requirements more stringent for a liquor permit than for a beer permit because of the greater alcohol content found in beverages authorized to be sold by the liquor permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the search by his neighbor, which occurred while the neighbor was caring for defendant's home during defendant's absence on a trip, was unauthorized, unreasonable, and in violation of La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 5, and that the fruits of that search therefore could not have provided the basis for a valid search warrant. The neighbor testified that he knew that defendant was in possession of pornographic materials, because he had borrowed them in the past, and further that he suspected defendant of sexual misconduct involving the neighbor's seven year old daughter. The court affirmed the order denying the motion to suppress the evidence. It reasoned that exclusion of evidence illegally obtained by a private citizen not acting under color of law did not further the goal of judicial integrity, but instead would deter citizens from reporting suspected crimes to police. The court concluded that art. 1, &sect; 5 permitted use of evidence obtained from some purely private searches to procure an otherwise valid search warrant, even if the private search was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The Commission upheld a steward's ruling that suspended the trainer for 30 days because prohibited medication was present in a horse's urine sample. The appeal raised the constitutionality of the &quot;absolute insurer&quot; rule in La. Admin. Code tit. 11, &sect; 6:53.18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After winning a race, a urine sample was taken from the trainer's horse, pursuant to &sect; 6:53.37.1. The state's chemist found the sample positive for procaine, a prohibited substance, and the trainer requested that a sample be sent to an alternate laboratory for further testing. One test at the alternate lab was not positive, but another test was positive. The lab explained that the test that did not show the presence of the drug probably resulted from a power outage that caused the samples to defrost. The trainer claimed that &sect;&sect; 6:53.15, .16, and .18 were violative of due process and were unconstitutional, in that a trainer was the absolute insurer of the condition of the horses that the trainer entered into a race, regardless of the acts of third parties. The court noted that when one weighed the control of the trainer, no one was in a better position to bear the obligation than the trainer. The government interest to insure honest and safe races, as well as to protect the integrity of the industry and its source of revenues, was substantial and was served by the rule. However harsh the rule, it was applied equally to all trainers and was not unconstitutional in its application.</SPAN></P>

The owner contended that the procedure deprived him of notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard. However, the court found that affixing tickets to the owner's windshield constituted service reasonably certain to provide notice of the violation. Further, the ordinances provided a reasonable opportunity for a hearing within 72 hours of seizure at the owner's request, and the alternative of posting bond pending trial ensured due process. The owner also maintained that requiring payment of all outstanding parking tickets plus the booting fee, or the posting of a cash bond equal to such sums, amounted to impermissible coercion to admit guilt. However, the court did not find that the scheme amounted to a presumption of guilt, but rather that it was an appearance bond that protected both the government interest in retaining fine payment security and the owner's interest in uninterrupted vehicle use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants argued that the trial court erred in not granting their motion for a continuance when the State amended the bill of information changing the charge from possession of marijuana with intent to distribute to possession of marijuana in excess of 100 pounds on the morning of trial. The court noted that although a lesser included offense was not involved, defendants were in no way prejudiced. Possession of the illegal drug was basic to the crime with which they were charged, and defendants knew the amount of marijuana that the evidence would establish they possessed. The only difference in the elements of crime that the jury would be required to consider was the amount of marijuana possessed and the fact that the jury would not need to determine intent to distribute. Contrary to defendants' contention, absent a showing of either bad faith by the State in not informing the defense of the inculpatory statement during pretrial discovery or substantial prejudice to defendants, the ruling of the trial court that denied their motion for a mistrial based on the use of the inculpatory statements was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was later arrested and convicted of second-degree battery. He sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction because the injury suffered by the victim did cause pain and swelling to her head. The court further found that when a twenty-one year old man struck a seventeen-year old girl on the head with either his fist or a blackjack there was a substantial risk of death, serious injury, or possible disfigurement. The court ruled that the sentence imposed by the trial judge was definitely not excessive because the trial court need not articulate every aggravating and mitigating circumstance outlined in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The court held that the sentence was particularized to defendant and was not grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. In view of the State's evidence, the court found that a rational trier of fact could have found that the co-defendant's testimony lacked credibility. The jury was entitled to disbelieve the version of the incident related by the co-defendant and, thus, the only reasonable inference of the evidence was that defendant was present with the co-defendant during the course of the burglary. The court rejected defendant's contention that the sentence was excessive, finding that the trial court adequately articulated the sentencing considerations necessary in particularizing the sentence to defendant.

In addition to seizing defendant's gun, the officer found a package of syringes on defendant that matched those taken from the pharmacy. Defendant was convicted of armed robbery. The court affirmed. Defendant had not been deprived of a full and fair voir dire and impartial jury even though the state legislature, through 1983 La. Acts 495, had reduced from 12 to eight the number of peremptory challenges to which defendant was entitled. There was no federal constitutional right to peremptory challenges, and even though the state constitution granted defendant a right to challenge jurors peremptorily, it did not give the right to a specified number of challenges. The reduction of the statutory number of peremptory challenges did not affect the nature of the crime, the authorized punishment, or the evidentiary rules. Instead, it related to the procedure used to determine guilt. Accordingly, the applicability of 1983 La. Acts 495 was determined by when the trial commenced and not when the offense was committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana) of manslaughter, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:31. On appeal, the court considered the application, the requirements, and the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:482, the denial of defendant's motion for a continuance, an alleged limitation on defendant's voir dire of the jury, and whether defendant's sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that evidence of a violent relationship between defendant and her husband-victim was not admissible, because she could not establish an overt act by the victim at the time of the shooting. On appeal, the court held that that the proper predicate for the introduction of the evidence was not laid. Nor did the fact that defendant pled insanity make it admissible. Because she did not shoot her husband out of a reasonable belief that the killing was necessary to save herself from imminent danger, the court did not consider the applicability of the battered woman's syndrome to that requirement of justification under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:20(1). Section 15:482 was not unconstitutional, nor did its application deprive defendant of a fair trial. There was no abuse of discretion either in a limitation of voir dire of the jurors or in the denial of a continuance based on the unavailability of a purported material witness. In sentencing defendant to 13 years at hard labor plus 2 years at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence, the trial court considered all of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who pled guilty to possession of methaqualone with the intent to distribute, sought review of the judgment from the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which denied his motion to suppress evidence. Defendant also sought review of his sentence on the theory that his sentence was unconstitutional because he was imprisoned only because he was now indigent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Contrary to defendant's contention, the trial court correctly denied his motion to suppress evidence. The police officers were able to corroborate an informant's tip by going to defendant's residence, by the description of his car complete with its license plate number, and by his possession of the tote bag containing the drugs. Additionally, the police had a photograph of defendant and were able to corroborate defendant's identity by use of it. Defendant argued his sentence was unconstitutional because he was in jail because he was indigent. Defendant was sentenced to five years at hard labor, subject to an unusual condition precedent agreed to by all parties. The sentence was to be suspended and defendant was to be placed on active probation, but only after he paid a $ 30,000. Defendant never made a claim of indigence before sentencing and there was no evidence to support his claim of indigence. The court held that when defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered into a plea bargain arranged with the aid of his counsel, the trial court did not have to suspend the sentence when defendant could not fulfill his end of the bargain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence and the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After decedent succumbed to injuries he sustained when he was struck by a car, his testamentary executor brought suit against the driver of the car, his employer, and his insurer seeking damages for medical and hospital expenses, burial and funeral expenses, succession and administration expenses, and the pain and suffering endured by the decedent. The trial court sustained exceptions of no cause of action and no right of action and dismissed the suit. On appeal, the executor asserted that the succession of a deceased was within the designated class of persons who were permitted under Louisiana law to claim damages arising out of the death of another person. The court disagreed and held that the right of action created by La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315 extended only to the beneficiaries named in the statute. The court further noted that the list was exclusive rather than illustrative and was strictly construed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner-trainer made several assignments of error, including that the Commission's requirement that owners and trainers waive consent to warrantless searches as a prerequisite to obtaining a license was unconstitutional. The court found that the warrantless search was unconstitutional, and did not consider other issues. Pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 703(E), the burden was on the Commission to prove that a warrant was not required. The Commission asserted that the police officers that conducted the search had been appointed Commission stewards. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4:147, the Commission could appoint stewards at its discretion, but there was no statutory or Commission rule making such an appointment. There was no evidence that the Commission had empowered the officers as stewards or that the officers were acting in their capacity as stewards, and not police, during the search. The Commission needed to demonstrate and prove a procedure by which the officers were appointed stewards. Without the evidence that should have been suppressed, the evidence was insufficient to find the owner-trainer guilty of violating any statutory or Commission regulations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's decision affirming the fine and the suspension of the owner-trainer's license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners held parcels of land located in a subdivision where most of the parcels were zoned single family residential and multi-family residential.

Although the Parish planning department recommended a reclassification of the parcels to General Office, the Parish zoning board refused to reclassify the parcels after a public meeting during which neighbors expressed their opposition. The court found that the reclassification of these parcels would be spot zoning because the surrounding parcels were zoned differently and the benefits of the reclassification would accrue chiefly to the property owners. The court held that the zoning board's decision was not arbitrary and that it did not amount to an unconstitutional taking of private property.</SPAN></P>

He started decorating his home and operating a lighting display during each Christmas season. The homeowners sued to enjoin the display alleging that the number and activities of the sightseers attracted to it created an intolerable situation in their neighborhood. A pre-trial conference was held at which the sheriff's department was present to discuss a traffic abatement plan. The trial court refused to issue a preliminary injunction. In its final judgment it denied the permanent injunction and ordered future displays be limited to a period of thirty days and a cessation of the lights and music each night by 11:00 o'clock. It then amended the judgment to grant a permanent injunction enjoining the individual from using public property in his display. The court affirmed finding that with the successful traffic control plan and the limitation on the time and period of operation the display was not a nuisance in fact. The court held that the trial court's restrictions on the display were parameters within which the court would not find the display to be a nuisance in fact.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school board filed a rule for taxes against defendants, who attempted to tender the funds under protest pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1576. The school board declined to accept payment, arguing that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1561 prohibited payment under protest once a &quot;suit&quot; was pending against a tax debtor. The district court ordered the school board to accept payment under protest and dismissed the rule. The court affirmed. A rule to show cause was not a &quot;suit&quot; as contemplated by &sect; 47:1561. A suit, or action, was an ordinary proceeding in a court by which one party prosecuted another for the enforcement or protection of a right, the redress or prevention of a wrong, or the punishment of a public offense. A rule, on the other hand, was an order made by a court at the request of a party to command the opposite party to do some act or to show cause why the act should not be done. Defendants' tender of money satisfied plaintiffs' rule and rendered it moot. The state constitution, the revised statutes, and the parish tax ordinance all specifically afforded a taxpayer his or her day in court, and tax statutes had to be interpreted liberally in favor of the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover police officer purchased a set of pills called &quot;T's&quot; and &quot;Blue's&quot; on the street from the defendant. One of these pills contained Pentazocine which was an illegal controlled substance. The undercover officer gave the pills to another officer. The defendant was charged with distribution of Pentazocine and was found guilty as charged by a jury by an 11-1 vote. The trial court sentenced the defendant to serve four years imprisonment without benefit of probation or parole. The defendant sought review contending that the admission of two pills, allegedly sold by the defendant, into evidence was error because the proper chain of custody had not been established and the sentence was excessive, in light of the fact that the defendant had no prior criminal record. The court affirmed the conviction holding that the fact that a testifying officer failed to remember the exact date the drugs were checked out of evidence lockup did not break the continuous chain of custody and, in any event, a defect in the chain of custody went to the weight of the evidence, rather than its admissibility. The sentence did not shock the court's sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1 and sentenced to a mandatory life sentence at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the testimony of defendant's accomplice that defendant was angry at the victim and shot him four times, the evidence that the gun that the accomplice tried to hide was the murder weapon, and defendant's statements that he knew why the police knocked on his door and that the victim should not have messed with him constituted sufficient evidence for the conviction. The officers' warrantless arrest of defendant was legal under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 213, because the officers knew that a murder, a grave crime, had been committed, the accomplice had just informed the police that defendant committed the murder and had guns in his home, and defendant's knowledge that the officers were there to arrest him constituted exigent circumstances. Thus, defendant's inculpatory statements made after his arrest and after he was given his Miranda warnings could not be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a hitchhiker, accepted a ride from his victim, struck the victim on the head with a fire extinguisher, and stole the victim's wallet with $ 38 in it. As a result, defendant was convicted of simple robbery under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:65 and sentenced to life imprisonment as a habitual offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(b). On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress the use of his prior convictions for impeachment purposes, because the convictions were admissible under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:495. The victim's testimony plus the scar he received from defendant's blow was sufficient evidence for the conviction. Defendant did not meet his burden of proving that he did not waive his Boykin rights when he pleaded guilty to a prior felony. Thus, the prior plea of guilty to armed robbery plus defendant's prior conviction for armed robbery was sufficient for the trial court to find that defendant was a habitual offender. The life sentence for a habitual offender was mandatory, and the provisions of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 did not apply.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner applied for the permit with the intent of operating a lounge on her property. The Parish denied the permit on the grounds that it would violate a parish ordinance that prohibited the sale of alcohol within 1,000 feet of private residences without approval of a majority of those residences. The trial court held that the Parish could not deny a permit on the basis of non-compliance with the ordinance because the ordinance was not a valid zoning regulation and state law prohibited local authorities from denying permits under any conditions other than those specified in the state statutes, which included zoning ordinances. The Parish conceded that the ordinance was not a zoning ordinance, but argued that it was a valid ordinance regulating the sale of alcohol as a means of protecting the public health, morals, safety, and peace. The court agreed that the Parish had the authority to adopt alcoholic beverage regulations stricter than those provided by state law, however, the court found that the Parish had not produced evidence to establish that the regulation was required for the protection of the public welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two years after her father died, a 41-year-old daughter sued her uncles, her father's brothers, seeking to prove filiation of her father by informal acknowledgment and to obtain a share in the property that the uncles inherited from their father after the daughter's father died. The trial court sustained the uncles' plea of prescription. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the one-year limitations period of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 209 was not unconstitutional, because the amendments to art. 209 provided for a grace period that gave the daughter more than one year after her father's death in order to prove filiation. Thus, the daughter had a reasonable time to assert her claim. The doctrine of contra non valentem did not apply to one uncle's statement that he would see that the daughter received her share of any property to which her father was entitled because the statement did not impede the daughter from initiating her filiation proceeding, which was separate from the succession proceedings. Thus, the limitations period was not tolled and the judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant businessman contested denial of his application for a preliminary injunction in the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The businessman got permission from the police jury to erect a bridge to obtain access from his property onto the street. He began hauling dirt, citizens complained, and the police jury passed an ordinance limiting loads on the streets. The businessman contended that the limit effectively put him out of business. The police jury removed the restriction, but then recapitulated. The businessman filed suit for a temporary restraining order (TRO), a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, damages for the loss of business profits, deprivation of civil rights and for the cost of the bridge. The TRO issued, but the trial court denied the businessman's application for a preliminary injunction. He appealed, and the court held that the police jury had the authority to establish load limits, and this limit did not solely apply to the businessman. The resolution was passed to protect residents and roads of the subdivision and applied to all vehicles. There was no evidence that the police jury acted arbitrarily or unconstitutionally. Further, the businessman failed to prove irreparable injury resulting from the load limit because he could haul dirt using smaller trucks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the 33rd Judicial District Court, Parish of Allen (Louisiana), which convicted of armed robbery, in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with armed robbery. He and accomplices robbed and killed three individuals. The conviction was based, in part, on circumstantial evidence, which supported the conclusion that defendant was a principal in the armed robbery. Defendant and the victims drove to a secluded area at which the shooter later arrived. Unless defendant had told him, the shooter would not have known to where the group was driving. The evidence tended to exclude all innocent explanations of the defendant's actions. The record showed that defendant was advised of the charges against him before he made statements to the police, and the statements he made were voluntary. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the jury to view the car and photographs of the bodies. The purpose of admitting the evidence was to establish the use of force. Reference by the prosecution to the killings in the rebuttal arguments also went to the use of force. The trial judge followed the sentencing guidelines and gave extensive reasons for the sentence imposed. Further the sentence was within statutory limits and followed the conviction of a most serious and heinous crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempted second degree murder, but plead guilty to aggravated battery for shooting his victim and agreed not to appeal his sentence. The trial court denied defendant's motion to quash the application of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1. Defendant sought writs on the denial of the motion, which the court denied, but the supreme court remanded. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court was not prohibited from applying both the firearms enhancement statutes,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.2 and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1, together as the legislature exercised its prerogative in enacting these provisions. The court rejected as meritless defendant's argument that he was not given notice that he was subject to these articles because they were not charged in the bill of information. Article 893.1 did not violate defendant's right to a meaningful sentence because it did not eliminate the trial court's discretion. Defendant's sentence was not excessive as he was under the influence of drugs when he fired at the victim and benefitted by pleading guilty to a lesser charge when he was charged with attempted second degree murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order of the trial court, which sentenced defendant for aggravated battery pursuant to two firearms enhancement statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant former husband challenged an order of the First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), which held that the husband's assets belonged to the community, with the exception of some stock acquired before the marriage, that the community should reimburse the husband for separate funds invested for the benefit of the community, and that all assets in the possession of plaintiff former wife belonged to her separate estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and the wife were both previously married and had substantial assets prior to their marriage. Following their marriage, without the knowledge of the husband, the wife filed declarations of paraphernality under former La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2386. The husband contended that he kept careful records of all money going into and out of his bank account, and that it was possible to distinguish between community and separate funds. However, the court found that the funds were co-mingled to the extent that were indistinguishable. Consequently, the husband's checking account belonged to the community, and any purchases made from the account belonged to the community. The court opined that its holding made it unnecessary to discuss the constitutionality of the &quot;double declaration&quot; rule, or the retroactivity of 1979 La. Acts 709. The court further found that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2386 and the wife's declarations of paraphernality resulted in the classification of the fruits of the wife's separate property as part of her separate estate. Article 2386 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it established parity between a wife and her husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and assessed all costs of the appeal to the husband.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a petition to terminate the rights of parents as to their four minor children and alleged that the children were placed in state custody due to their abuse and neglect in that the family had no home, no food, and no suitable clothing for the children. The petition also stated that one of the children had multiple cigarette burns on his chest, legs and arms that precipitated his being placed in foster care at the age of two years. The trial court signed two separate judgments, the first of which terminated parental rights as to three of the children, and the second terminated parental rights as to the fourth child. The parents claimed the punishment was excessive. The court however, found that termination of parental rights was not a punishment, and proceedings were not initiated in an attempt to punish the parents for their status as alcohol abusers. Rather, they were a reasonable exercise of the state's interest in the welfare of these children. Further, the judgment was not based on the singular allegation of alcoholism, but was based on a combination of conditions. The state proved its case by clear and convincing evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that terminated the rights of the natural parents of four minor children, and the court fixed the award of attorneys' fees for appellate services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover officer requested that a girl employed by an escort service be sent to his hotel room. Defendant arrived, searched the room, received $ 60 &quot;for herself&quot; and $ 300 for the escort service, disrobed, and attempted to perform oral sex on the officer, at which time she was arrested. An officer stationed in the hallway observed defendant enter the room, went inside, and retrieved $ 400 from defendant's purse. The serial numbers on the bills matched those of bills previously noted on the officers' list of buy money. On appeal, the court held that the trial court's recusal upon the State's motion during defendant's first trial was mandatory under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 775(3) because the judge had previously represented defendant's pimp; therefore, double jeopardy did not bar defendant's retrial and conviction. Defendant's attack on the constitutionality of art. 14:89 was not raised in the trial court. Defendant's entrapment defense failed on the merits, even though the trial court mistakenly believed entrapment to be incompatible with defendant's complete denial of culpability. Defendant's general intent to commit the crime was proved by her actions.</SPAN></P>

On review, defendant argued, among other things, that the trial court erred because it failed to give sufficient reasons for the sentences imposed and failed to consider mitigating circumstances in accordance with La.

According to the court, the trial court noted that defendant had several prior felony convictions, and that defendant was a danger to both society and himself. The trial court also noted that the two counts of armed robbery were crimes of violence, and that the burglary of an inhabited dwelling also presented potential danger of harm to others. The trial court also articulated several mitigating factors in imposing the sentences.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the engineer of a train that was hauling hazardous materials, which derailed and exploded.

The court found that, even assuming that his statements were improperly taken, the admission of these statements was harmless error. Defendant's testimony was free of any constitutional taint and contained basically the same facts as the inculpatory statement of which he complained. Both his testimony at trial and inculpatory statement focused on three major questions: a witness's location at the time of the derailment; the speed of the train at the time of derailment; and when, where, and how much alcohol had defendant consumed prior to the derailment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant parish police jury appealed as punitive a judgment from the Thirty-Second Judicial District Court for the Parish of Terrebonne (Louisiana), which made the police jury compensate plaintiff landowner for use of his land in an amount in excess of its actual value. The issue was the proper measure of damages pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38:113, providing for the control of public drainage channels.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor for the police jury dredged a channel depositing 50,000 cubic yards of spoil along the 100 foot servitude on the landowner's farm. The court found that the police jury was not arbitrary or capricious and did not act in bad faith. An expropriation did not occur. The taking and damage occurred as a result of the police jury exceeding the scope of authority granted it by &sect; 38:113. Therefore, the issue was the proper measure of damages. The measurement for damages was found by the district court to be the cost of restoration and the value of the lost use of the property under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315. The court found this measure to be in error. The dredging of the channel satisfied the public purpose requirement of La. Const. art. I &sect; 4. The police jury proceeded under authority of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38:113 and a court order in conducting the operations. The court therefore held that the proper measure of damages was the lesser of either the market value of the property and severance damages minus any residual value or the cost of restoration to the property's condition at the time the taking was initiated, but not both.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured wife, was struck and injured by an uninsured motorist. The insureds filed suit against their uninsured motorist (UM) insurer, under two separate insurance policies, both of which provided uninsured motorist coverage. The insureds settled with the insurer for the limits of one uninsured policy and the medical payments under both. They then proceeded against the insurer under the second uninsured policy coverage. The insurer's motion for summary judgment was granted and the insureds appealed contending that the criteria of the anti-stacking law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1406 D(1)(c)(1977) were so clearly arbitrary and capricious as to render that legislation unconstitutional. The court found that three conditions must exist in order for &sect; 22:1406 D(1)(c) to apply: (1) the insured party must have been occupying an automobile not owned by him; (2) there must be UM coverage on the occupied vehicle, which coverage is primary; and (3) there must be at least one other UM coverage available to the injured party who has not been fully compensated for his damages. The court affirmed finding that the statute was constitutional, and the insureds did not fit the exception.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1111C(2)(d) of the Louisiana Code of Governmental Ethics and that the corporation had violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1113B of the Code.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the judgment, the court held that the arrangement violated the Code. The court first held that the Commission on Ethics did not err in refusing to disclose the specific correspondence that led to the Commission's involvement in the matter, because it was not required to do so under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1141(D)(12), and because the Commission disclosed to appellants the identities of all persons whom it had interviewed in the matter. The court next held that the Commission did not err in conducting a preliminary fact-finding inquiry into the matter. The court also held that the Code was applicable to the corporation, even though it was not a public officer or employee, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1113(A) and (B). The court also held that the Code was violated even though the subcontract did not materially affect the member's compensation, because the Code was directed at conflicts of interest in addition to actual abuse and corruption. The court also held that the Code did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant telephone company sought review of a judgment from the Civil District Court, for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which issued an injunction against the company's termination of telephone service for appellee subscriber based on a single tariff violation caused by a clerical error. The subscriber also challenged an earlier ruling of the trial court that denied it an injunction against threatened termination of services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The subscriber sought injunctive relief against the threatened termination of its telephone service by the local telephone company. The trial court denied the injunction, holding that the recorded message that violated the telephone company's tariff was patently obscene and therefore devoid of constitutional protection. The subscriber's services were then terminated when it transmitted a message similar to the one the court had termed obscene. Claiming that this transmission was the result of a clerical error, the subscriber sought a preliminary injunction ordering the telephone company to reinstate the service. This time, the district court issued the injunction, holding that the tariff was unconstitutional to the extent that it permitted termination of a subscriber's service on the basis of a single violation caused by clerical error. On review, the court found that the telephone company's action must be considered state action for purposes of the 14th Amendment. The court also found that the tariff was not in violation of the constitution, nor preempted by federal law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of a preliminary injunction and concluded that the telephone company's action in terminating service pursuant to its tariff was lawful. The court also affirmed the later judgment insofar at is ordered reinstatement of the service, but reversed insofar as it declared the tariff unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to five counts of issuing worthless checks. Defendant was placed on supervised probation for 18 months. Restitution on all five of her worthless checks was a special condition of probation. Days after the convictions on the five counts, defendant was arraigned on seven more counts of issuing worthless checks. At arraignment, defendant was advised of her right to a jury trial on the two counts for worthless checks for an amount in excess of $ 100.00. Defendant pled not guilty to the seven charges. The district court also revoked defendant's probation, imposed the originally 18 month sentence, and held a trial where plaintiff faced 22 counts of issuing worthless checks. The State dismissed 10 of the 22 counts against defendant. Defendant pled guilty to the remaining charges. The district judge sentenced defendant to two years on each of the first two counts, consecutively, and two years each on the remaining 10 counts, to run concurrently with the first two counts. Defendant appealed. The court reversed in part noting that defendant was not apprised of her right to trial by jury in pleading guilty and remanded for a new trial on those charges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his challenge for cause of a juror who was a police dispatcher; that the trial judge erred when he stated in the sentencing phase of the trial that he was of the opinion that the evidence supported a conviction for the more serious crime of aggravated rape; and that the sentence was excessive. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentence. It held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant's challenge for cause, or in denying the motion for new trial on the same grounds, where the juror's testimony showed that her deliberations would not be biased due to her position, which was administrative and could not be considered an active involvement in law enforcement. The court also held that the trial judge was within his discretion to look at the underlying circumstances of the crime in sentencing and to state that he felt the evidence supported a conviction for a more serious crime. It held that where the trial judge followed the sentencing guidelines and gave extensive reasons for the sentence imposed, and where the sentence was within statutory limits, there was no manifest error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an acknowledged illegitimate son and the administrator of the estate of his deceased mother, complained of a judgment of the 16th Judicial District Court, Parish of Iberia, State of Louisiana, which held that he was precluded from inheriting and dismissed his claim, and held, further, that plaintiff adopted daughter's sale of her deceased adoptive mother's succession, entered into with her adoptive father, would not be annulled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son argued that despite the fact that his mother died in 1970, her succession was not opened until 1980, and the law in effect at the time of the opening of the succession should govern. The court held, however, that the inheritance rights of illegitimates whose ascendants died prior to the effective date of the 1974 Constitution was controlled by the Louisiana Civil Code then in effect; the rights of those whose ascendants died after that date would be governed by the Louisiana Civil Code as limited by La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, which constitutionally prohibited arbitrary discrimination against illegitimates. Because the mother died in 1970, La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 918 (repealed 1981) dictated the inheritance rights of her acknowledged illegitimate son, and precluded him from inheriting from her because at the time of her death she had a legitimate child, the adopted daughter. The court, therefore, affirmed the decision of the district judge. The court held that the decision of the district judge that there was insufficient evidence of fraud or error to vitiate the consent of the adopted daughter was not manifestly erroneous and, therefore, affirmed his decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to three of six drug-related offenses. After changing attorneys, defendant's request to withdraw his plea before sentencing was denied. Defendant was sentenced to five years imprisonment for each of the three counts to which he pled guilty, with the sentences to run concurrently, and a $ 5,000 fine. The court held that defendant failed to show that his guilty plea did not meet constitutional requirements. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion under La. Code Crim. Proc.

Ann. art. 894.1 by individualizing defendant's sentence to the particulars of the crime. The facts and background in the case supported the sentence and fine imposed in light of the sanctions imposed in similar cases. Defendant's involvement in the drug trade apparently was not limited to the immediate offenses, he had a large amount of various controlled substances in his possession at the time of his arrest, and he threatened police officers and an informant while he was out on bail.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was a four-year-old child who was not sworn in prior to her testimony. The court noted that the trial court, the district attorney, and the defense attorney questioned the child as to her competency outside the presence of the jury. The court found that the testimony was properly admitted even though a formal oath was not administered. The court pointed out that the victim first stated that she did not remember facts but, upon further questioning, she answered. However, she testified that no one told her what to say, and the trial court instructed the jury that they were to weigh the child's testimony &quot;with special caution.&quot; The court held that there was no manifest error in the trial court's finding that the victim was competent to testify. The court found that the terms &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; and &quot;sexual penetration&quot; were common terms and were sufficient to give adequate warning of the proscribed conduct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant parish tax assessor sought review of an order of the Ninth Judicial District Court, Rapides Parish (Louisiana), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiff tax purchaser in his mandamus action brought to compel the tax assessor to assess to the tax purchaser unredeemed tracts of land purchased at tax sales.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish tax assessor contended that the tax rolls should not be changed until the redemption period had expired and the tax purchaser had quieted title by an action in monition. The tax purchaser contended that, because he was a tax purchaser, he was entitled to have the properties assessed in his name from the date of recordation of a tax deed. The court agreed with the trial court that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:2193 it was mandatory that the assessor enter the property on the tax rolls in the name of the tax sale purchaser after recordation. However, the court disposed of the issue on other grounds, that the tax assessor was without interest or the right to question the constitutionality of &sect; 47:2193. The tax assessor was a public official, charged with the statutory duty of assessing property sold at tax sales according to the provisions of &sect; 47:2193. These duties were ministerial in nature and the tax assessor was without the interest or right to question the constitutionality of the statute prescribing these duties, as a defense to a mandamus proceeding. The court held that even though the tax assessor's position was untenable, it was not frivolous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court in the tax purchaser's action to compel the assessment of properties in his name and denied damages for a frivolous appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This accident occurred at an intersection that normally was controlled by a traffic light but which was out of order at the time of the accident. Defendant was travelling eastbound into the intersection and turning left when her car was struck by plaintiff's car, which was travelling westbound. In affirming the judgment for plaintiff, the court first held that the trial court had not erred in striking defendants' demand for a jury trial. The court held that although the trial court had signed a jury order, it had done so based on plaintiff's original $ 250,000 demand, which was in excess of the $ 1,000 threshold for jury trials that existed at the time the petition was filed. The court held that when plaintiff amended her petition to demand $ 5,000, this placed the demand below the threshold for jury trials contained in La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1732(1), which had been increased in the interim, so that the trial court correctly rescinded the jury order.

Further, the court noted that defendant failed to specify how the trial court did not comply with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1.

After discussing their observations regarding the manner in which the women had performed and their belief that the women were clad only in G-strings, the officers summoned additional police officers to the scene by radio. The five women performers, which included defendants, were thereafter arrested for obscenity. One of the officers testified that women performers were dressed in G-strings and each of the dancer's breast nipples appeared visible to him. One officer testified that he observed that each of the dancers had a small amount of translucent surgical tape covering the breast nipple area. Defendants were convicted of obscenity in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:1061A(1). On appeal defendants asserted that because their nipples were covered with the tape during the performances they were not exposed as proscribed by &sect; 14:061A(1). The court affirmed and amended. The court held that based on the evidence the trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that, during the performances in question; defendants' breast nipples were exposed in violation of &sect; 14:106A(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a third offense DWI in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98. Defendant filed a motion to quash the bill of information and argued that he was denied equal protection of the law due to the disparity in the sentencing provisions for third offense DWI and fourth offense DWI. Specifically, a third offense DWI conviction required that six months of the sentence be served without parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, while a fourth offense DWI conviction had no such requirement. After the trial court denied the motion, defendant pleaded guilty, but reserved his right to appeal. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that because the trial court did not specify that a portion of defendant's sentence was to be served without parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, he had not been adversely affected by the alleged disparity in the sentencing provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:98 (D) and (E). As such, the court concluded that defendant did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pleaded guilty to one of the counts. At trial, the evidence revealed that defendant sold the cocaine at the behest of an uncle at a time when defendant was pressed for money after a divorce and was required to pay a $ 200 per month child support order. Defendant was a high school graduate and was gainfully employed for most of his adult life. Defendant had no prior juvenile or adult record for arrests or convictions. Family for defendant testified as to his remorsefulness and his simple life style of going to work and spending time with his fiancee. The trial court deemed that society would be better off with defendant in prison and sentenced him to five years. The court affirmed the conviction, but vacated and remanded for resentencing, holding that it was not proper for a judge to account for larger sociological concerns, without giving a defendant a properly individualized sentence. The trial court abused its discretion, because probation was a valid minimum sentence that was supported by objective facts, as opposed to subjective conclusions.</SPAN></P>

A homeowners association and various individual homeowners filed suit seeking injunctive relief against the corporations' use of the home. The association relied on various provisions in building restrictions applicable to all homeowners in the subdivision, which prohibited any use that was not residential, and prohibited commercial use, or use by a school, church, assembly hall, or fraternal group home. The trial court found that the home was used for a commercial purpose and granted a preliminary injunction against the non-profit corporations. The court reversed, holding that restrictions affecting immovable property were to be strictly construed, with any doubt resolved in favor of unencumbered property use. The court found that the home was residential and looked to La. Rev. Stat.

It held that defendant's position, that some unknown person used his weapon to commit the murder and then placed the weapon underneath defendant's pillow, was reasonably rejected by the jury, and that defendant suggested no other hypothesis of innocence that would raise reasonable doubt as to his guilt. The court also held that the search of defendant's vehicle, which produced a holster, was justified by exigent circumstances after a police officer stopped defendant for a traffic violation, and that defendant voluntarily consented to a search of his home, which produced the gun and an empty cartridge case, and to the atomic absorption test for gun residue. The court also held that the amendment to La. Code Crim. Proc.

The court affirmed the judgment. The mayor's court was constitutional even though the mayor was untrained in law because a trial de novo was provided from a mayor's court pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1896. In addition, the court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:441.3 was constitutional. There was no evidence to support plaintiff's contention that the mayor could use his power under &sect; 33:441.3 to help a friend or hurt an enemy. Section 33:441.3 allowed the mayor to appoint a magistrate to sit in his stead as presiding official over the mayor's court. The court held that the position of the mayor was no different from any other judge who might choose to abuse his discretion. There was no showing that the equal protection rights of any citizen had been violated. The court also held that &sect; 33:441.3 did not violate La. Const. art. V, &sect; 22 because the term judge as used in that article could not be applied to mayors who function in mayors' courts or justices of the peace who function in justice of the peace courts.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rendered a judgment in favor of the homeowner against the adjacent lot owner only. The trial court specifically found that the pile driving work caused the damage to the homeowner's property. However, the trial court found that the evidence adduced on the trial of the case failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the general building contractor or the piling subcontractor were negligent. On appeal, the court could not say that the trial court was clearly wrong in finding no negligence on the part of the piling subcontractor. Therefore, the court also affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the adjacent lot owner's third-party demand against the piling subcontractor. Finally, the court found that the adjacent lot owner could not complain that the trial court would not allow evidence of third-party fault because no offer of proof was ever made.

Defendants denied the applicant's request for a building permit due to a lack of available parking based upon a change in use from a restaurant to a lounge. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's conclusion that defendants' actions were arbitrary and capricious. Because there was no evidence showing when defendants' decision was filed in the office of the zoning appeals board, the court rejected defendants' contention that the applicant's appeal was untimely. The court ruled that there was no reasonable basis for concluding that there was a change in use because the zoning ordinances treated restaurants and lounges equally with respect to parking requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who had been arguing with his sister, pointed a loaded gun at his sister's boyfriend when the boyfriend walked into the living room. The sister was intoxicated and lying on the floor. According to defendant, he was attempting to uncock the gun when it discharged, killing his sister. Defendant was convicted of negligent homicide. The court affirmed. Expert testimony established that notwithstanding the sister's intoxication, her death directly resulted from the gunshot wound. The trial court correctly applied La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1 when sentencing defendant. Those who used a firearm when violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32 were subject to the enhancement provisions of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1. Negligent homicide was a felony, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32 did not prohibit the suspension of sentence. The trial court was thus required to impose a sentence of five years at hard labor without the benefits of probation or parole if it found that a firearm was used in the commission of the negligent homicide. Defendant was not entitled to a separate hearing on the applicability of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1 regarding the use of a firearm.</SPAN></P>

During the voir dire, defendant changed his plea to guilty on all four counts. The trial judge accepted the plea after informing defendant of the rights he was waiving and after determining that the waiver and plea were given voluntarily and knowingly. After the appropriate delays, defendant was sentenced to four eight-year concurrent sentences. From these sentences defendant appealed, alleging that the sentence was excessive. The court noted that each conviction subjected defendant to a maximum prison term of 12 years and a fine. Further, the court explained that at the time of the fourth offense, defendant was on parole for convictions on other burglaries. Additionally, the court noted that the State had nolle prossed another charge. Because defendant was given no sentence promises upon his plea and the trial court complied with La. Code Crim. Proc.

The motion to quash was denied, and the matter proceeded to trial. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:330 prohibited the possession of any firearm while taking or hunting frogs during the nighttime. La. Const. art. I, &sect; 11, stated that a citizens right to keep and bear arms should not be abridged except that the legislature could pass laws regarding concealed weapons. The prohibition against simple possession of a firearm while frogging bore no rational relationship to any legitimate State interest in protecting its natural resources. Also, the firearm provision was too broad to accomplish protection of the frog hunters from themselves or other froggers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chemical company challenged an assessment of ad valorem taxes, first, to the parish board of review, and second, to the state tax commission. The chemical company then filed a discovery request upon the assessor of the parish, seeking an inspection of the ad valorem tax returns of all industrial and industrial land taxpayers in the parish. Upon the assessor's objection, the matter was set for hearing before the commission. The commission refused to order discovery, and the chemical company sought review by the distinct court. The district court reversed the commission's holding, and ordered inspection. After 12 industrial taxpayers filed an exception of non-joinder of indispensable parties, the assessor applied and obtained a supervisory writ of review. The court denied discovery, and remanded the case. The court ruled that the tax returns were not relevant to determine whether the chemical company was assessed at fair market value, and that the chemical company failed to allege a sufficient factual basis underlying its claim of lack of uniformity to permit discovery of the tax returns.

On appeal, the court held that defendants' convictions were sufficiently supported by evidence showing that the film depicting hard core sexual conduct was displayed in a public place and that defendants participated in the presentation of the film. The court ruled that &sect; 14:106 was not unconstitutionally vague because persons of ordinary intelligence could determine what conduct was regulated by &sect; 14:106. Although it might have been error to allow the jury to view the four reels of the film out of their proper order, the court concluded that the error was harmless because hard core sexual conduct was displayed throughout the film and because viewing the film in its proper order did not give the film any salvaging literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</SPAN></P>

The court also affirmed the trial court's refusal to allow the victim to be questioned about whether or not she had ever committed acts of prostitution. The court noted that that the &quot;rape shield statute,&quot; La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for manslaughter and sentenced to consecutive sentences of five and two years at hard labor without the benefit of parole. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. There was sufficient evidence to convict defendant for manslaughter because the record did not support defendant's contention that the gun was accidentally discharged. The coroner testified that the wound indicated that the victim was moving when he was shot and did not have the effect contended by defendant. Further, the location of the wound also conflicted with defendant's testimony. In addition, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1 and La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:95.2 were not violative of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 (1974) because defendant's contention that the statutes made no measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment and that the sentences mandated by the statutes were grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crime had already been presented to the court. Thus, for the reasons already assigned in the prior case, the court found that the statutes were not unconstitutional and that defendant's sentence did not constitute excessive punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in connection with the shooting death of his girlfriend while they were traveling in a car.

In affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court held that the statutory scheme defining second-degree murder under &sect; 14:30(1) and manslaughter under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:31 did not violate the Due Process Clause. The &quot;sudden passion&quot; and &quot;heat of blood&quot; provisions of the manslaughter statute were considered affirmative defenses to the charge of murder. The murder statute did not place any burden on defendant to disprove an essential element of the crime charged. Further, the evidence in the case was sufficient for a reasonable trier of fact to find pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

The court held that the victim was competent to testify because her testimony at the competency hearing and at trial established that she knew she would be punished if she did not tell the truth despite her hesitation on answers during the trial. The victim's testimony in chambers at the competency hearing appeared to be direct and unhesitating. Second, the court held that it was evident from the record that because of her age the victim had trouble telling her story, and the judge allowed repetitive questioning by the prosecutors merely to obtain her testimony.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a marine service, appealed from a decision of the Twenty-Third Judicial District Court Parish of St. James (Louisiana), which issued judgment for plaintiffs, landowners, in their action to enjoin the service from mooring barges in the Mississippi River bordering on the landowners' property and requiring the service to remove any anchor, buoy, or piling in the bed of the river immediately bordering on the landowners' property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The marine service was engaged in barge fleeting operations on the Mississippi River in Louisiana. The operations occurred in front of the landowners' property. The landowners sought to enjoin the service from warehousing of barges in front of their properties and sought to remove the services' buoys and anchor pilings from the river bed. The service admitted that its mooring operations were conducted without the approval of the landowners or the state. The court held that the injunctions were properly issued against the service. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:1102.1, only the landowners had a right to erect and maintain buildings and improvements on the river. The service was required to obtain a lease from the landowners before seeking authorization of his commercial purposes from the state. The state's creation of the port commission and empowering it to enact certain regulations governing constructions on the river did not unreasonably interfere with navigation. The service was not prejudiced by failure to give a hearing on the merits of the landowners' request for a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the course of an armed robbery at a convenience store, the store clerk and a sheriff's deputy were killed. The trial court found defendant guilty of two counts of second-degree murder in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly refused to suppress a custodial confession made by defendant because the evidence supported the finding that the confession was given freely and voluntarily and not induced by threats, promises, or coercion. The court found that the trial court properly applied 1983 La. Acts. 495, which reduced the number of peremptory challenges in capital cases from 12 to eight, because the case commenced after the effective date of the act. Therefore, its application was not ex post facto. The court also found that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a change of venue because the evidence of record failed to show that there was either actual or presumed prejudice against defendant to a degree that would render a fair trial impossible. Finally, the court found sufficient evidence to support the verdict. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction for carry a concealed weapon by a felon in violation of La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14:95.1. The trial court properly refused to suppress the two switchblade knives because absent internal conflict the trial court could accept the police officer's testimony over defendant and three witnesses' contrary testimony. Although &sect; 14:95.1 did not contain a definition of &quot;carry&quot; or of &quot;conceal,&quot; the statute did not have to in order to make sense, as anyone who spoke English would know what those words meant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court originally sentenced defendant to five years in prison. In defendant's first appeal, the court remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing because the trial court failed to accord proper weight to the sentencing guidelines contained in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. On remand, the trial court imposed the same sentence after it considered defendant's employment status, his attempted shooting of an undercover police officer during a drug sale, and the serious nature of drug trafficking. Defendant contended that the sentence imposed was excessive. The court held that a sentence was unconstitutionally excessive under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 when it was no more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering or when it was grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime. The court held that the five year sentenced imposed upon defendant was greatly disproportionate to the offense and that it was excessive in light of defendant's lack of a prior criminal record, his rural background, the amount of marijuana involved, and a comparison of sentences in other cases. The court reduced defendant's sentence to two years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which convicted defendant for armed robbery in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an 11-hour interrogation, defendant implicated himself in five armed robberies -- one of which involved the victim. The court remanded the action for a determination of whether defendant's confession was voluntary. Defendant moved to suppress his confession, alleging that two officers following his arrest and prior to his confession to a third officer had beaten him. The State could not simply rely on the general testimony of the third officer who was not present but had to rebut defendant's specific incidents of coercion. The officers accused of beating defendant did not testify at the suppression hearing. In the absence of their testimony regarding the specific and detailed allegations of abuse, the trial judge may have erred by finding the confession voluntary. Thus, the court remanded the action for retrial of the motion to suppress. The court found, however, that the State was not obliged to retry the motion to suppress defendant's confession at trial in order to establish a predicate for the confession because the trial judge's refusal to grant the motion, however erroneous, was binding at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court did not reverse defendant's conviction for armed robbery; rather, the court remanded the action for another trial on defendant's motion to suppress.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought a permit to sell alcoholic beverages containing more than six percent of alcohol by volume.

Mandamus was not an available remedy because the applicant did not comply with parish regulations and submit an application for 3.2 percent beer. While the mandamus action was properly dismissed, the court stated that the parish ordinance prohibiting 3.2 percent beer was in contravention of the repeal of La. Rev. Stat.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.2. The combination of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.2 did not impose a mandatory minimum sentence that was excessive. Under the manslaughter statute alone, a defendant was exposed to a possible sentence of 21 years. La. R.S. 14:31. There was no problem with the fact that it was possible to impose a sentence in excess of that provided for the particular crime of manslaughter. As the purpose of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.2 was to provide for an additional penalty when a firearm was used in crimes that either mandated or allowed imprisonment at hard labor, the judge could impose an additional penalty at hard labor, where the original penalty was imposed at hard labor.</SPAN></P>

All occupants were arrested and taken to the police station where the woman whose purse was searched gave officers consent to search the car. More drugs were found during that search. The appellate court held that: (1) the officers had probable cause to arrest the occupants of the car, and the search of the purse was lawful; (2) the consent the officers obtained to search the car was not tainted by prior illegal activity; and (3) although no drugs were found on the male defendant, his conviction was supported by drugs found in the trunk of the car and $ 2,400 in cash that was found on him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer sued defendants sheriff and tax collector seeking damages for the alleged unconstitutional increase in the taxpayer's ad valorem taxes. The taxpayer appealed the decision of the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, Parish of Tangipahoa (Louisiana), which dismissed the taxpayer's suit on the grounds of peremption, and awarded the sheriff $ 1,250 in attorney fees on the grounds that the suit was frivolous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sheriff had the authority to raise or lower certain ad valorem tax millage in order to provide funds for operating the sheriff's office. On September 9, 1982, the sheriff conducted a public hearing, called pursuant to a notice attached to the courthouse door the previous day. The taxpayer alleged a violation of the Open Meeting Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:4.1 et seq. The appellate court concluded that the time limitation in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:9 was peremptive, and that the taxpayer's failure to file his suit within the 60 days allowed barred the action forever. Because it was clear from the facts of the case that the taxpayer's suit was untimely, the trial court correctly maintained the sheriff's exception of peremption. In addition, since there was no evidence of non-compliance with the statute and the suit was brought without substantial justification, the trial court correctly awarded attorney fees, which the appellate court found were reasonable.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the State failed to carry its burden to prove that the statements were made freely and voluntarily and were not induced by threats, promises, or coercion. In upholding the trial court's admission of the statements, the court of appeals noted that the State specifically rebutted all allegations of mistreatment. In addition, the court of appeal noted that the trial court obviously found credible the testimony of the officer. Defendant also argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the verdict. The court of appeal found that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational finder of fact could have found that every element of attempted simple burglary had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer was a union leader with 13 years of service at the time of his termination. The police officer sought the rehearing alleging caselaw support which held similar sick leave regulations to be violative of several fundamental rights.

The court held that the court in the caselaw incorrectly relied upon the proposition that a police department's sick leave regulations must stand the test of strict scrutiny; instead, a more lenient standard of review was required. The court found that the sick leave regulations were rationally related to the maintenance of discipline and morale within the department. The regulations promoted discipline and morale by encouraging all officers to report &quot;sick&quot; only when they were truly incapable of performing any police duty. The court further held that the regulations were neither arbitrarily nor unreasonably applied to the police officer, nor enforced against him in a discriminatory manner.</SPAN></P>

Nonetheless, the appellate court decided to review defendant's sentence for excessiveness as it was a claim of a constitutional violation. Although the trial court failed to comply with La.

Tracing the history of this provision, and the law pertaining to the right to a jury trial, the court upheld the constitutionality of La. Code Crim. Pro. Ann. art. 493.1, and its application in this case to relieve the trial court of any requirement for a jury trial where the penalties remained within six months confinement and $ 500. According to the court, the statute reflected a proper legislative determination of where the line should be drawn for imposing the right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a sentence for conviction of possession of marijuana, the court granted defendant's writ of certiorari and made it peremptory. The court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded for resentencing. The penalty provision for possession of marijuana under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:966(D)(1) was that upon a first conviction, an offender must be fined not more than $ 500 and imprisoned for not more than 6 months, or both. The court held that the sentences originally imposed were illegal, as each assessed a fine of $ 2,000. The trial court correctly set aside the original illegal sentences. Although the trial court was authorized to set aside both the fines and the jail sentences and to reimpose legal sentences, its discretion in resentencing was not unbridled. Defendant had the right to have an illegal sentence set aside, and should not be saddled with apprehension that a new sentence, although within statutory limits, would be more severe. The new sentence represented a reduction in fines and an increase in jail terms. The court held that the penalty imposed by the trial court upon resentencing was more severe than that originally imposed and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had prior felony convictions. Defendant was charged by bill of information with the crime of armed robbery. Defendant initially requested a trial by jury, but later petitioned the court for a bench trial. The trial court convicted defendant of armed robbery and ordered a pre-sentence investigation. An appeal of this conviction was not perfected by defendant's appointed counsel. New counsel was appointed for defendant. Defendant then filed an application for writ of habeas corpus. On review, the court was unable to address under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 841 a new assignment of error that defendant raised in his appellate brief where it was raised for the first time on appeal. The court held that the sentence that the trial court imposed was proper under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 where the sentence was fully supported, articulated, and was not excessive. The court determined that another point of error that defendant raised was abandoned on appeal where neither brief nor argument was presented to the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with soliciting an undercover police officer for a crime against nature.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that it was clear that any rational trier of fact would have found defendant guilty of the crime as charged. The court pointed that defendant initiated the solicitation and was the first to mention an amount of money.

The trial court determined that the victim did not understand or comprehend the nature of the offense due to her mental condition and further, that defendant knew of the victim's incapacity. Defendant contended that his five year sentence at hard labor was excessive and that the trial court did not follow the sentencing guidelines set forth in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The court held that the trial court considered the mitigating factors in favor of defendant and, in weighing the totality of the circumstances, it properly concluded that the factors favoring imprisonment far outweighed any mitigating factors which might be accorded to defendant. The court further held that defendant's sentence was not disproportionate to the crime and it found that the sentence was light considering that defendant could have received 25 years.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administratrix of an estate sought review of a judgment from the Twelfth Judicial District Court, Parish of Avoyelles (Louisiana), which upheld the claim of appellee creditor. The creditor answered and claimed that the trial court erred in sustaining a three-year plea of prescription to some of her claims. The administratrix claimed that the trial court erred in ruling that the creditor had sustained her legal burden of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased died intestate. His succession and that of his wife, who died 17 years earlier, were opened. The administratrix filed a proposed tableau of distribution. The creditor filed a petition to establish liability for services allegedly performed on behalf of the decedent, including visiting him at his nursing home, performing chores for him, and running errands for him. The trial court found that the issue was not the validity of the claim, but the amount. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the trial court had committed manifest error in the findings of fact and application of law. The court held that the proof offered by the creditor was legally inadmissible under the guidelines of the Dead Man's Statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3721, and that it was legally insufficient to prove the claim according to the standard set forth in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3722. The court also noted that the one-year period of prescription applied to the case, not the three-year, because the creditor was given only one year under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3721. The court only approved payment to the creditor of the amount that was for debts incurred after the death of the deceased.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the sentence, challenging the applicability of art. 893.1. In affirming, the court concluded that the legislature intended that the &quot;use of a firearm&quot; enhancement under art. 893.1 would apply to the illegal use of weapons or dangerous instrumentalities just as any other felony where suspension of sentence had not been otherwise prohibited and a finding was made that a firearm was used in the commission of the offense.

Furthermore no search warrant was required to conduct undercover activities. The court also found that there was no reason to consolidate another charge with the present one. Noting that it was the legislature's job to differentiate between punishments, the court also found no error in the sentence as it was well within the guidelines.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the prisoners claimed that various policies in effect at one of the state penitentiaries were violative of various sections of the federal and state constitutions. The trial judge held that the rights asserted by the prisoners did not rise to constitutional standard and dismissed the suit. The court affirmed. Because prisoners were not a &quot;suspect&quot; class, the court applied the &quot;rational relationship&quot; test, not the &quot;compelling state interest&quot; test, and held that prison administrators had discretion to adopt the challenged policies in order to maintain internal order and discipline. Policies depriving prisoners of certain articles, prohibiting prisoners from buying flammable products, requiring prisoners to be restrained outside of their housing, and restricting internal prison mail were rationally related to the legitimate state interest of protecting the prisoners and guards and maintaining order, and were not denials of due process or equal protection, or cruel and unusual punishment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The medical center terminated the police officer on the basis that he was only able to work at night due to his service in the National Guard. Prior to hiring the police officer, the medical center had full knowledge that the police officer was only able to work at night. In fact, the police officer obtained the approval of the medical center before re-enlisting in the National Guard, again with the understanding that he would work for the medical center only at night. The court affirmed the decision ordering that the police officer be reinstated. Specifically, the court held that the evidence showed unequivocally that the police officer was hired with full knowledge and consent of the appointing authority for the medical center that he work only the night shift based on his service in the National Guard. As such, the medical center was not able to complain on appeal that it was error to reinstate the police officer for only the night shift. Furthermore, the court found that the police officer was entitled to an award of attorney's fees under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1451, in light of the magnitude of legal work involved in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the judgment by increasing the award of attorney's fees to the police officer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for second degree murder raising four assignments of error. The court rejected the contention that the State failed to prove every element of the crime of second degree murder as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:271. The court also rejected the contention that the trial court erred in not granting a mistrial for defendant's appearance on the first day of trial in prison clothing. The court found that the objection was not made until after defendant had switched to civilian clothing and that the trial judge had not noticed anything distinctive about the clothing that caused him to recognize it as prison attire. The court did not find fatal the presence of a witness in the trial court after having been sequestered as provided for by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 764. Significant to the court was that the trial court had specifically found that there was nothing that the witness might have heard from the preceding witnesses that would have altered her testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim had money and was spending it freely at a bar where defendants observed him. Defendants thereafter conspired to deprive defendant of the funds and brutally attacked the victim at a later time in an effort to abscond with the money. The plan was foiled and defendant managed to fortunately survive the ordeal. Police were called and observed what appeared to be blood stains on both defendants' shoes and clothing. They were both tried and convicted of attempted armed robbery. The male was also convicted of attempted manslaughter. Defendants sought review. On appeal, the court determined that the search and seizure of defendants' apparel was evidence clearly within defendants' immediate control. Further, the seizure was made subsequent to a valid arrest and was a means to preserve evidence, therefore it was legal. The court found that reference to a civil suit was properly controlled by the trial court. Also, the trial court's counseling of defense counsel not to mislead the jury after the court had sustained an objection was proper. There was no error in the prosecutions remarks to the jury. No merit was found in any of the other contentions forwarded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cable franchise instituted an action for injunctive relief against the cable company, and relief declaratory of its rights vis-a-vis those of the cable company to operate cable television systems in the parish. The cable franchise provided cable service to the residents of the unincorporated areas of the parish under a nonexclusive franchise, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4361. The cable company was also providing service to customers in the same area, and it had been doing so since for about 18 years. The cable company, however, was not operating under a La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4361 franchise. For that reason the cable franchise sought to have the cable company's operation declared an unlawful infringement on its franchise rights and permanently enjoined or, alternatively, restricted in scope. The trial court dismissed the cable franchise's action. The court held that the cable company lawfully commenced its operations in 1966 pursuant to the State law then in effect. The court further determined that the cable company was formed for the purpose of transmitting intelligence and was allowed, pursuant to the parish police powers.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then made an oral confession to another officer and gave a taped confession. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder. The court affirmed. Although the statements made to defendant's wife were inadmissible under the husband-wife privilege, those conversations were privileged but not illegal. Thus, defendant's subsequent statements did not have to be suppressed. The court rejected defendant's argument that the police had played upon his religious sensitivities. The officer who had the prayer session with defendant had sought to speak with defendant to share Christ, not to solicit a statement. Although that officer was a former deacon, he was not a clergyman under La. Rev. Stat.

Personal jurisdiction was based on &sect; 13:3201(g) of the Long Arm Statute. The State served the petition and citation by certified mail pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3204. The trial court sustained defendant's declinatory exceptions, alleging lack of jurisdiction over the person and insufficiency of service of process. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erroneously held that it could not exercise long arm jurisdiction over a nonresident unless it could establish continuing jurisdiction from a former proceeding. However, the trial court correctly sustained the exception on other grounds. The State's petition was completely devoid of any factual allegations that the child was conceived while defendant either resided in or was in the state, the express statutory minimum contacts necessary to establish jurisdiction under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) granted the petition of relators, doctors and insurers, for a writ of certiorari presenting the issue of whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 could be applied retroactively, which would bar the action of respondent patient brought against the doctors and insurers for malpractice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In June of 1975 the doctors performed x-rays on the patient which allegedly demonstrated disease of the lungs, but the doctors did not advise of or treat for the condition. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628, which provided that actions for damages against physicians had to be filed within three years of the date of the alleged injury, became effective September 12, 1975. The patient discovered his condition in April of 1979 and filed his action in September of 1979. The doctors and insurers petitioned the court for a writ of certiorari regarding the issue of whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:5628 could be applied retroactively to bar the action of the patient against them for malpractice. The court granted the petition and issued the writ granting summary judgment in favor of the doctors and insurers. The court found that because the retroactive application of &sect; 9:5628 did not divest the patient of anything other than three additional months within which to file his action, and that even extending the period to three years from the effective date of the act, the patient would still not have been timely, retroactive application was appropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court directed that the writ of mandamus issue ordering that summary judgment be granted in favor of the doctors and insurers and that the patient's action for malpractice against them be dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued the children had no right of action because the action to establish filiation was not timely. The trial court sustained the exception upon its finding, ex proprio motu, that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 209 required that filiation be established in a separate proceeding vis-a-vis other possible heirs or family members before illegitimate children who are not formally acknowledged may assert a tort claim. Contrary to the findings of the trial court, the court held that there was nothing in the statute which would prohibit the children, the statutory beneficiaries, from combining their action to establish filiation under art. 209 with their wrongful death/survival action. All art. 209 required was that a civil proceeding be filed asserting filiation. Therefore, the trial court's ruling that such an action must be brought in a separate proceeding was clearly wrong. The court also found the children's action was filed in a timely manner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court that sustained the exception of no right of action was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the victim confronted each other following an altercation between their daughters. Defendant shot the victim when the victim tried to pin defendant between the door and the cab of defendant's car. The court upheld defendant's conviction and sentence, rejecting defendant's numerous claims of error. The court found no errors in the admission of evidence and no insufficiency of evidence. The evidence as a whole established that it was more probable than not that the projectile introduced into evidence was the object originally seized by police officers. The court also found sufficient evidence from which the jury could find specific intent. The court found no error in the jury instructions. The trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury as to negligent homicide because negligent homicide was not a responsive verdict and was not pertinent to the evidence presented. Further, defendant suffered no prejudice from the trial court's refusal to inform the jury of the mandatory sentence under the firearms enhancement statute,&nbsp;La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 893.1. Finally, the court rejected defendant's contention that art. 893.1 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was given a concurrent sentence of five years on the welfare offense, theft of property having a value greater than $ 500. The court held that the imposition of the maximum sentence under &sect; 14:67 was not an abuse of discretion in light of the fact that fines and probation failed to deter defendant from further criminal conduct and that the pre-sentence investigation showed that no circumstances justified leniency and that the interests of defendant's children were best served by placing them in other homes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, upon a guilty plea, of manslaughter, and sentenced to 19 years at hard labor plus two additional years imprisonment to run consecutively, without benefit of parole, probation, suspension of sentence, or credit for good time. Defendant challenged the sentence, arguing that it was excessive. The court ruled that the trial judge complied with the proper procedure set forth in the sentencing guidelines in sentencing defendant, and that the sentence imposed was not excessive. The court noted that the trial judge relied upon the presentence investigation report, and carefully explained the considerations taken into account and the factual basis for imposition of the sentence. The court held that there was no error in the consideration by the judge of defendant's prior juvenile history and prior adult arrest record. The court held that the sentence of 19 years did not even meet the maximum statutory limit, and the additional two years for the use of a firearm in the commission of manslaughter was a mandatory sentence and not within the discretion of the trial judge.</SPAN></P>
