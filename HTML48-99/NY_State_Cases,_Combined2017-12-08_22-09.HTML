</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the St. Lawrence County Court (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the Town Court of the Town of Norfolk (New York) convicting defendant of harassment under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of harassment under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.25 after cursing at a neighbor. The court reversed the conviction and dismissed the case because defendant's obnoxious behavior did not create an immediate likelihood of violence. The law defining the offense was overbroad and created an unconstitutional limitation on speech. Defendant had not made a real threat to commit an assault. Speech could not be forbidden merely because it was annoying. The court therefore held that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.25(2) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction and dismissed the case, holding that the harassment law under which defendant was convicted was an unconstitutional limitation on freedom of speech.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Statute -- Harassment -- Use of &quot;Abusive&quot; Language with Intent to Harass -- Overbreadth</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Penal Law &sect; 240.25 (2), which proscribes the use of &quot;abusive&quot; language with the intent to &quot;harass&quot; or &quot;annoy&quot; another person, is invalid for overbreadth, under both the State (NY Const, art I, &sect; 8) and Federal (U.S. Const 1st, 14th Amends) Constitutions because the statute, on its face, prohibits a substantial amount of constitutionally protected expression, and because its continued existence presents a significant risk of prosecution for the mere exercise of free speech.  At the least, any proscription of pure speech must be sharply limited to words which, by their utterance alone, inflict injury or tend naturally to evoke immediate violence or other breach of the peace.  However, the proscriptions of Penal Law &sect; 240.25 (2) is not limited to such &quot;fighting words&quot;; it extends to any &quot;abusive&quot; language intended to &quot;annoy&quot;, and no fair reading of the statute's unqualified terms supports or even suggests the constitutionally necessary limitations on its scope.  Accordingly, an information, to the extent it charges defendant with harassment under section 240.25 (2), is dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Statutes -- Construction -- Limitations on Judicial Construction to Cure Unconstitutionally Overbroad Statute Regulating Speech</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The unconstitutional overbreadth of Penal Law &sect; 240.25 (2), which proscribes the use of &quot;abusive&quot; language with the intent to &quot;harass&quot; or &quot;annoy&quot; another person, cannot be cured by judicial construction restricting its reach to &quot;fighting words&quot; or other words which, by themselves, inflict substantial personal injury.  Although a statute ought normally to be saved by construing it in accord with constitutional requirements, the very language of the statute must be fairly susceptible of such an interpretation.  Here, the language of section 240.25 (2) simply does not even suggest a limitation to violence-provoking or substantial injury-inflicting utterances. An attempt by the court to so limit the statute would be tantamount to wholesale revision of the Legislature's enactment, rather than prudent judicial construction. Moreover, to so construe the statute would likely result in transforming an otherwise overbroad statute into an impermissibly vague one; the statutory language would signify one thing but, as a matter of judicial decision, would stand for something entirely different.  Under those circumstances, persons of ordinary intelligence reading section 240.25 (2) could not know what it actually meant.  Such a deficiency is especially intolerable in a statute regulating speech, since it chills the expressive freedom of those who believe the statute means what it says, and subjects individuals to arrest and prosecution, even if ultimately unsuccessful, by officials strictly enforcing the statute's prohibitions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Crimes -- Harassment -- Threat of Physical Harm</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The conviction of defendant for harassment under Penal Law &sect; 240.25 (1), based upon her statement to the complainant that she would &quot;beat the crap out of [complainant] some day or night in the street&quot;, is reversed.  There is nothing in the record demonstrating that defendant's statement was either serious, should reasonably have been taken to be serious, or was confirmed by other words or acts showing that it was anything more than a crude outburst. While genuine threats of physical harm fall within the scope of the statute, such an outburst, without more, does not.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant automaker sought review of the order of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which modified and affirmed a prior judgment that permanently enjoined the automaker from charging a deductible to customers, and requested restitution for those who had already paid it, pursuant to N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 63(12), in favor of respondent state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The automaker issued a two stage warranty for its new automobiles and light trucks. In its primary stage, the basic warranty covered the entire vehicle and was effective for the vehicle's first year or 12,000 miles, whichever occurred first. During the second stage, the automaker applied an extended warranty that charged a $ 100 deductible for the earlier of the vehicle's second year or 18,000 mile. The state sought to enjoin the automaker from charging the deductible and requested restitution for those who had already paid it, pursuant to N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 63(12). The state argued that it violated the state's &quot;Lemon Law.&quot; This law prohibited motor vehicle manufacturers from charging for warranty-covered repairs made during the earlier of the vehicle's first two years or 18,000 miles. N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 198-a(b). The court affirmed the order, holding that the deductible charging practices violated the Lemon Law, pursuant to the express language of the statute and the law's legislative history. The court further held that the Lemon Law was not unconstitutional because there was no attempt at direct regulation, no discriminatory effect, and no in-state favoritism.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order, which modified and affirmed a prior judgment that permanently enjoined the automaker from charging a deductible to customers, and requested restitution for those who had already paid it, in favor of the state, because such deductible charging practices violated the Lemon Law, pursuant to the express language of the statute and the law's legislative history.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Motor Vehicles -- Lemon Law -- New Car Lemon Law -- Validity of Deductible for Warranty-Covered Repairs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Appellant automaker's imposition against consumers of a $ 100 deductible for repairs to a vehicle's powertrain and other major components covered by an extended warranty, which applies to the earlier of the vehicle's second year or 18,000th mile, violates the provision of the Lemon Law prohibiting motor vehicle manufacturers from charging for warranty-covered repairs made during the earlier of the vehicle's first two years or 18,000 miles (General Business Law &sect; 198-a [b]).  The statute clearly and unambiguously provides that when a new motor vehicle does not conform to all express warranties for the earlier of its first two years or 18,000 miles, &quot;[the] manufacturer * * * shall correct said nonconformity * * * at no charge to the consumer&quot; (General Business Law &sect; 198-a [b]).  By the automaker's expressly warranting the performance of the powertrain and other major components during the extended portion of the statutory period, there arose by operation of the Lemon Law an unconditional duty by the automaker to repair any warranted nonconformities &quot;at no charge&quot; to the consumer. Even if the deductible can be legally transformed into a condition precedent as urged by the automaker, it would be in direct contravention of the legislative expression and intent found in the statute itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Jurisdiction -- General and Plenary Jurisdiction of Appellate Division to Impose Discretionary Restitution Remedy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A proceeding pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 63 (12) is not exempt from the general and plenary jurisdiction of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court to impose a discretionary restitutionary remedy.  Section 63 (12) is the procedural route by which the Attorney-General may apply to Supreme Court for an order enjoining repeated illegal or fraudulent acts.  The statute expressly provides that such an injunction, if granted, may also direct restitution. Although an application by the Attorney-General for remedial orders under section 63 (12) is addressed to the sound judicial discretion of the Supreme Court, once that court makes its ruling the initial adjudication is reviewable in a plenary fashion by the appellate level of the Supreme Court itself.  Thus, in a proceeding pursuant to Executive Law &sect; 63 (12) in which Supreme Court declared that appellant automaker's practice of charging consumers a deductible for certain warranty-covered repairs to vehicles violated the express warranty provision of the Lemon Law (General Business Law &sect; 198-a [b]), the Appellate Division, upon the appeal from Supreme Court's judgment, was authorized to review and to grant the discretionary remedy of restitution petitioned for by the Attorney-General.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- New Car Lemon Law Provision Requiring Repairs at No Charge to Consumer -- Commerce Clause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The express warranty provision of the Lemon Law (General Business Law &sect; 198-a [b]), insofar as it prohibits the charging of a deductible for a warranty-covered repair during the statutory period of coverage, i.e., the earlier of a vehicle's first two years or 18,000 miles, does not violate the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8, cl 3), since there is no attempt at direct regulation, no discriminatory effect and no in-State favoritism by the statute's requirement that warranty-covered repairs be made &quot;at no charge&quot; as limited to vehicles sold and registered in New York State (General Business Law &sect; 198-a [a] [2]).  Further, the statute's burden on interstate commerce cannot be anything but incidental in the constitutional Commerce Clause sense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Matters Reviewable -- Review by Court of Appeals of Constitutional Question on Appeal by Permission of Court of Appeals -- Constitutional Question Not Addressed by Appellate Division</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. On an appeal to the Court of Appeals, by permission of that court, from a judgment of Supreme Court, bringing up for review a prior nonfinal order of the Appellate Division which did not address the constitutionality of the Lemon Law (General Business Law &sect; 198-a) in respect to appellant automaker's practice of charging a $ 100 deductible for certain warranty-covered repairs, on the ground that the issue was not properly before it, the Court of Appeals should resolve that issue as part of the appeal before it on the grant of the motion for leave to appeal, since the constitutional question in the particular aspect at issue in this case remains in the case in view of the constancy from the onset of the litigation of the constitutional challenge to the statutory prohibition of a $ 100 deductible. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants providers challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a trial court determination in a declaratory judgment action that procedures used by respondent, the Commissioner of the Department of Social Services (DSS), pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, 518.7, were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The providers, two medical laboratories that provided services under the New York State Medical Assistance Program (Medicaid), were audited by the DSS and were found to have charged for services not performed; reimbursement payments to the providers were withheld by the DSS pursuant to N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 518.7. The providers filed an action under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78, seeking a declaratory judgment that the withholding of Medicaid reimbursement payments was arbitrary and capricious, and that the providers had been deprived of their property rights without due process of law. The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court. Applying the three-part test for determining whether a governmental action violated due process, the court concluded that the procedures for withholding payment of Medicaid reimbursement claims set forth in N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 518.7 were not unconstitutional. The procedures adequately safeguarded the private interests of the providers and minimized the risk of erroneous deprivation while serving a substantial government interest in safeguarding the integrity of the state's Medicaid program.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Medicaid Reimbursement Payments -- Constitutionality of Regulation Authorizing Withholding of Reimbursement Payments under Specified Circumstances -- Procedural Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. To the extent that providers in the Medicaid program may enjoy a constitutionally protected property right in the payment of their claims for reimbursement for services rendered, 18 NYCRR 518.7, which authorizes withholding payment of reimbursement claims under certain specified circumstances, provides adequate procedural due process and thus passes constitutional muster.  The procedures for withholding payment of Medicaid reimbursement claims set forth in 18 NYCRR 518.7 adequately safeguard the private interests of petitioners, and minimize the risk of erroneous deprivation while serving the substantial government interest in safeguarding the integrity of the Medicaid program.  Moreover, the regulations permit withholding payment only where there is &quot;reliable information that a provider is involved in fraud or willful misrepresentation involving claims submitted to the program or has abused the program or committed unacceptable practices&quot; (18 NYCRR 518.7 [a]).  Notice of the withholding must be given to the provider promptly, within five days (18 NYCRR 518.7 [b]), and the notice must describe the reasons for the withholding and afford the provider an opportunity to make written submissions and arguments in opposition (18 NYCRR 518.7 [c] [4]).  The withholding may not continue beyond 90 days unless a written report or notice of proposed agency action is given to the provider (18 NYCRR 518.7 [d]) in which event the provider would be entitled to request a hearing (18 NYCRR 518.7 [d] [2]; 518.8 [b]).</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In two CPLR article 78 proceedings commenced by petitioners, clinical medical laboratories enrolled as providers in the New York State Medical Assistance Program (Medicaid), challenging respondent's decision to withhold payment of petitioners' claims for reimbursement for services rendered pursuant to 18 NYCRR 518.7 pending review and verification of the reimbursement claims, petitioners' contention that respondent's decision to withhold payment was arbitrary and capricious is without merit.  Respondent's decision to withhold payment pending the audit was based on &quot;reliable information&quot; -- written statements of several physicians indicating that some of petitioners' claims were improper, which provided an adequate basis for the withholding of payment pending audit and review.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs brought suit asserting that New York, N.Y.

The appeals court held that where owners are forced to accept the occupation of their properties by persons not already in residence, the resulting deprivation of rights was sufficient to constitute a physical taking for which compensation was required. The appeals court continued and held that when the adjustment of rights for the public good became so disproportionate that it could be said that the governmental action was forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole, a regulatory taking of property occurred.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Local Laws, 1987, No. 9 of the City of New York, which prohibits the demolition, alteration, or conversion of single-room occupancy (SRO) properties and obligates the owners to restore all units to habitable condition and lease them at controlled rents for an indefinite period, is facially invalid as a physical taking in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions (US Const 5th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 7) and is, therefore, null and void.  Local Law No. 9 requires the owners to rent their rooms or be subject to severe penalties; it compels them to admit persons as tenants with all of the possessory and other rights that that status entails; it compels them to surrender the most basic attributes of private property, the rights of possession and exclusion.  Where, as here, owners are forced to accept the occupation of their properties by persons not already in residence, the resulting deprivation of rights in those properties is sufficient to constitute a physical taking for which compensation is required.</SPAN></P>

Local Laws, 1987, No. 9 of the City of New York, which prohibits the demolition, alteration, or conversion of single-room occupancy (SRO) properties and obligates the owners to restore all units to habitable condition and lease them at controlled rents for an indefinite period, is facially invalid as a regulatory taking in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions (US Const 5th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 7) on the ground that it denies SRO owners economically viable use of their properties.  The coerced rental provisions deprive owners the fundamental right to possess their properties.  Moreover, these mandatory rental provisions -- together with the prohibition against demolition, alteration and conversion of the properties to other uses, and the requirement that uninhabitable units be refurbished -- deny owners of SRO buildings any right to use their properties as they see fit.  In addition, Local Law No. 9, particularly in those provisions prohibiting redevelopment and mandating rental, inevitably impairs the ability of owners to sell their properties for any sums approaching their investments and, therefore, must also negatively affect the owners' right to dispose of their properties.  Whether the property rights abolished or impaired are considered alone, or the values of these rights are compared with the values of the properties as a whole, the conclusion is inescapable that the effect of the local law's provisions is unconstitutionally to deprive owners of economically viable use of their properties.</SPAN></P>

Local Laws, 1987, No. 9 of the City of New York, which prohibits the demolition, alteration, or conversion of single-room occupancy (SRO) properties and obligates the owners to restore all units to habitable condition and lease them at controlled rents for an indefinite period, is facially invalid as a regulatory taking in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions (US Const 5th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 7) because the burdens imposed by the local law do not &quot;substantially advance&quot; its putative purpose of relieving homelessness. The nexus between the obligations placed on SRO property owners and the alleviation of the highly complex social problem of homelessness is indirect at best and conjectural.  Such a tenuous connection between means and ends cannot justify singling out this group of property owners to bear the costs required by the law toward the cure of the homeless problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Taking of Property without Just Compensation -- Local Law Mandating Preservation of Single-Room Occupancy Properties in City of New York -- Buy-Out, Replacement and Hardship Exemptions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The invidious effects of Local Laws, 1987, No. 9 of the City of New York, which prohibits the demolition, alteration, or conversion of singleroom occupancy (SRO) properties and obligates the owners to restore all units to habitable condition and lease them at controlled rents for an indefinite period, are not mitigated by the local law's buy-out, replacement and hardship exemptions so that the local law becomes constitutionally acceptable.  The effect of the moratorium and antiwarehousing measures is unconstitutionally to deprive owners of their basic rights to possess and to make economically viable use of their properties; merely allowing the owners to purchase exemptions from the law by paying cash or by providing an equal number of replacement units cannot alter this conclusion.  Nor can the hardship exemption, which can do no more than permit the Commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development -- in the event that an owner could ever come within its provisions -- to exercise his discretion and lower the purchase price of escape from the law, make a difference.  Local Law No. 9 creates an illegal taking notwithstanding the buy-out and replacement options; the local law does not become legal simply because an owner may, in some cases, buy his way out of the law by paying a lesser sum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought reversal of the ruling of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirming their convictions for burglary, attempted grand larceny, and conspiracy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged their convictions for conspiracy to steal antiques. Defendants' convictions were affirmed by the state intermediate appellate court, and they took a further appeal. The state's highest court reversed due to erroneous denial of severance. The court reasoned that severance was compelled when the core of each defense was in irreconcilable conflict with the other and where there was a significant danger that the conflict alone would have led the jury to infer defendants' guilt. That was the case here, as one defendant's defense was complete denial and the other's was a claimed lack of intent to defraud. In addition, redaction of one defendant's pretrial statement, in order to protect the other defendant, deprived the first of a fair opportunity to use that statement in his defense. Since defendants' defenses were not only antagonistic but also mutually exclusive and irreconcilable, with a jury being unable to credit both, severance was required. The convictions were reversed and remanded for retrials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were reversed, and the cases were remanded for separate retrials. The trial court committed reversible error when it failed to grant appellants' motion for severance, given antagonistic, mutually exclusive, and irreconcilable defenses offered by defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Conspiracy -- Verdict -- Sufficiency of Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In the prosecution of defendants involving a staged theft from a warehouse of a collection of artifacts owned by one defendant, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that both defendants had conspired, as charged, to stage a burglary and fraudulent theft in order to collect the insurance proceeds covering the collection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Consolidation and Severance -- Undue Prejudice -- Antagonistic Defenses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Antagonism in the defenses advanced by jointly tried defendants results in such prejudice under CPL 200.40 (1) as to compel severance where the core of each defense is in irreconcilable conflict with the other and where there is a significant danger, as both defenses are portrayed to the trial court, that the conflict alone would lead the jury to infer defendant's guilt. Accordingly, in the prosecution of two defendants for burglary, attempted grand larceny and conspiracy arising out of the staged theft from a warehouse of a collection of artifacts owned by one defendant, with the objective of recovering the insurance proceeds, where the defendant owner denied any participation in the crimes and the other defendant conceded the theft, but, in defense, claimed that there was no intent to defraud the insurer, the denial of defendants' motions pursuant to CPL 200.40 to be tried separately on the ground of undue prejudice was an abuse of discretion.  The defendants' defenses were not only antagonistic but also mutually exclusive and irreconcilable.  The jury could not have credited both defenses.  The People's proof of the conspiracy and attempted grand larceny charges was largely circumstantial.  In a case of directly conflicting defenses such as this, there was a significant possibility that the jury unjustifiably concluded by virtue of the conflict itself that both defenses were incredible and gave undue weight to the government's evidence.  Under those circumstances, defendants were denied a full opportunity to present their defenses, and did not receive a fair trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Consolidation and Severance -- Undue Prejudice -- Redaction of One Defendant's Statement to District Attorney</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the prosecution of two defendants for burglary, attempted grand larceny and conspiracy, arising out of the staged theft from a warehouse of a collection of artifacts owned by one defendant, with the objective of recovering the insurance proceeds, defendant owner was unduly prejudiced at the joint trial, when, out of concern for a possible </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Bruton</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> problem with respect to the other defendant, large portions of the defendant owner's statement to an Assistant District Attorney were redacted.  It is not crucial that the excised portions of the statement, which defendant owner would have been entitled at a separate trial to have the jury consider in its entirety, were not &quot;exculpatory&quot; in the strictest sense.  The redacted material supported the defendant owner's defense arguments and if believed, it explained much of the evidence against him.  Given the circumstantial nature of the People's case against defendant owner, redaction of these areas of his statement, which would have provided the jury with an explanation for some of the evidence equally consistent with an inference of innocence as of guilt, was unduly prejudicial.  The People's contention that the redaction actually favored defendant owner because a few details of the excised answers were arguably inconsistent with his trial strategy is not dispositive; the great bulk of defendant owner's statement was entirely consistent with and supported his defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Preservation of Issue for Appellate Review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. On appeals to the Court of Appeals from Appellate Division orders affirming the judgments convicting defendants of attempted grand larceny, burglary and conspiracy, defendants' contentions that, even if the People proved all of the allegations of the indictment, the acts they were charged with committing did not amount to an attempt to commit grand larceny or to a burglary, were preserved for review by defendants' pretrial motions to dismiss on that precise ground, even though defendants did not specifically seek dismissal on that basis at the close of the People's evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Attempt -- Conduct &quot;Dangerously Near&quot; Completion of Intended Crime -- Attempted Grand Larceny</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Before liability can be imposed for the substantive crime of attempt (Penal Law &sect; 110.00), a defendant's conduct must come &quot;very near&quot; or &quot;dangerously near&quot; completion of the intended crime.  The defendant's act need not be the final one toward the completion of the intended crime.  The necessity of further steps for the completion of the crime and the possibility of abandonment or renunciation are factors to be considered in evaluating whether conduct has come &quot;dangerously close&quot; to success, but are not dispositive.  Accordingly, in the prosecution of defendants arising out of the staged theft from a warehouse of a collection of artifacts owned by one defendant, with the objective of recovering the insurance proceeds, where defendants had not yet reported any loss to the insurer or filed an insurance claim when police intervention put an end to their scheme, the defendants' actions reached the stage where they were &quot;very near&quot; or &quot;dangerously near&quot; completion of the larceny of the insurance proceeds so as to constitute an attempt.  The fact that defendants had not yet taken the final step necessary to obtain the insurance money does not mean that the steps they had taken could not constitute an attempt to do so; nor does the theoretical possibility that defendants might yet have renounced the criminal venture obviate their liability for an attempt.  The steps they had already taken were more than substantial: they had secured insurance, arranged for shipment of the goods from Europe and storage in a particular New York City warehouse, and hired thieves who actually broke in and removed the goods.  These steps took defendants to the point where only a few comparatively minor acts -- all wholly within defendants' own power -- remained to be accomplished.  Thus, in the circumstances of this crime and this case, defendants' conduct went sufficiently beyond mere preparation and, as the jury found, constituted attempted grand larceny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Attempt -- Model Penal Code</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The Court of Appeals does not adopt the Model Penal Code's definition of an attempt as a &quot;substantial step&quot; toward completion of crime </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Model Penal Code &sect; 5.01) in order to conclude that some acts -- even if preparatory in a dictionary sense -- go sufficiently beyond &quot;mere preparation&quot; as to be properly characterized as an attempt for which criminal liability may be imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Burglary -- Intent to Commit Crime within Premises -- Criminal Facilitation -- Attempted Grand Larceny</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In order to secure a conviction for burglary (Penal Law &sect; 140.20), the People need only allege and prove a knowing and unlawful entry of the premises coupled with an intent to commit a crime therein.  There is no requirement that the People allege or establish what particular crime was intended, or that the intended crime actually be committed.  Thus, in the prosecution of defendants arising out of the staged theft from a warehouse of a collection of artifacts owned by one defendant, with the objective of recovering the insurance proceeds, there was sufficient proof that defendants intended that the crimes of criminal facilitation and attempted grand larceny be committed by their hired helpers in the warehouse to support defendants' convictions for burglary premised on their liability as accessories for the acts of their hired helpers in breaking into the warehouse and removing the artifacts. The evidence amply demonstrates that defendants intended that their hired helpers engage in conduct that would provide defendants with the means to commit the felony of grand larceny, as the theft of the artifacts was a necessary step in their scheme to recover the insurance proceeds.  Thus, the conduct intended by defendants was the crime of facilitation (Penal Law &sect; 115.00), and it took place within the premises their accomplices had entered illegally.  Moreover, since it is not necessary that the intended crime be completed to sustain a burglary conviction, it is of no moment that the ultimate grand larceny never took place.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner town sought to enjoin respondent owner from continuing operation of an adult bookstore in a prohibited zone in violation of the town's zoning ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Town sought to enjoin owner from continuing operation of an adult bookstore in a prohibited zone in violation of the town's zoning ordinance. The ordinance differentiated between certain adult uses and limited the operation of adult uses to areas zoned Industrial I. It also provided that nonconforming adult uses should be amortized over a period of years based on a graduated scale of investment in the business. The court upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance and granted the town a permanent injunction. The appellate division modified the judgment by striking a provision of the ordinance that required proprietors to obtain a special permit before establishing an adult use in an Industrial I district. On appeal, the court affirmed holding that under the stipulated facts there remained ample space available for adult uses. The court held that the ordinance, as approved by the appellate division, was no broader than needed for the intended purpose and did not violate the State Constitution. The court opined that the amortization provisions were content-neutral under the federal and state constitutions. The court concluded that the ordinance was neither vague nor overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate division's modification and affirmation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Regulation of &quot;Adult Uses&quot; under Zoning Power -- Federal Constitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under the Federal Constitution, municipalities are permitted to regulate adult bookstore and theater uses through the zoning power if they can establish that (1) the &quot;predominant purpose&quot; of the ordinance is not to control the content of the material purveyed but to control the &quot;secondary effects&quot; of such uses on the surrounding community, (2) the ordinance is designed to serve a substantial governmental interest, (3) it is narrowly tailored to affect only the category of uses that produce the unwanted effects, and (4) it allows for reasonable alternative avenues of expression.  Thus, the zoning ordinance of the Town of Islip, insofar as it restricts certain adult uses, defined as those which exclude minors by reason of age, to areas zoned Industrial I, meets Federal constitutional standards.  The &quot;predominant purpose&quot; of the Islip officials in enacting their ordinance was to eliminate the secondary effects of adult uses and to attempt to control future development in the business districts, not to regulate expression.  The governmental interest supporting the ordinance is the eradication of the effects of urban blight and neighborhood deterioration and furtherance of the general underlying purpose of zoning, the enhancement of the quality of life for the Town's residents.  The ordinance does not impose any limitation on the content of the material or the ability of the creators or sellers to distribute it and it does not restrict in any significant way those wishing to acquire adult books from doing so.  Moreover, the ordinance is narrowly tailored to affect only those uses shown to produce the unwanted secondary effects, and it provides alternative locations within the Town for adult use businesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Regulation of &quot;Adult Uses&quot; under Zoning Power -- State Constitution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Under the NY State Constitution, regulation designed to carry out legitimate and important governmental objectives which incidentally burdens free expression may be sustained only if the State action is no broader than needed to achieve its purpose.  Accordingly, the zoning ordinance of the Town of Islip, insofar as it restricts certain &quot;adult uses&quot;, defined as those which exclude minors by reason of age, to areas zoned Industrial I, does not violate the State Constitution.  Although the Town's zoning ordinance addresses only adult uses, it was not a purposeful attempt to regulate speech; the ordinance was enacted to correct the effects of adult uses on community development, and its effect on expression is only incidental. The adverse affects of adult uses on the Town's neighborhoods are not subject to direct attack and the Town's use of its zoning powers was the most appropriate means to address its substantive problems.  Arguments can be advanced that different techniques should be used to address the problem, but that is not to say that they are constitutionally required.  The ordinance adopted is an appropriate method for addressing existing problems; it is not overinclusive and it does not unduly restrict adult uses to limited or unsuitable areas of the Town.  Accordingly, the ordinance, insofar as it restricts adult uses to the Industrial I zone, is no broader than needed for the intended purpose and does not, therefore, violate the State Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Regulation of &quot;Adult Uses&quot; under Zoning Power -- Validity of Amortization Provisions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A challenge by respondents, the owners of property within the Town of Islip upon which an adult bookstore is being operated, to the provisions of the zoning ordinance of the Town of Islip which require the termination of nonconforming adult uses through amortization over a period of 1 1/4 to 5 1/4 years, measured from the 1980 effective date of the ordinance, on the ground that those provisions are facially unconstitutional because they apply to preexisting uses, is rejected.  In light of the intractable problem of eliminating nonconforming uses, amortization provisions of a zoning ordinance may be sustained if the period allowed to recapture the investment in the use is reasonable.  Reasonableness is determined by examining all the facts, including the length of the amortization period in relation to the investment and the nature of the use.  Presumptively, amortization provisions are valid unless the owner can demonstrate that the loss suffered is so substantial that it outweighs the public benefit gained by the exercise of the police power.  Here, respondents failed to overcome that presumption, since they have continued to operate well past the maximum five-year amortization period and they have presented no evidence of economic loss which would establish unreasonableness.  Conversely, the Town has established the damage caused to its neighborhoods by adult uses and the substantial investment it has made, particularly in the village where respondents' property is located, to overcome the blight caused in part by them.</SPAN></P>

A challenge by respondents, the owners of property within the Town of Islip upon which an adult bookstore is being operated, to the provision of the zoning ordinance of the Town of Islip which requires the termination of nonconforming adult uses through amortization over a period of 1 1/4 to 5 1/4 years, on the ground that amortization applied to uses enjoying constitutional free speech protection amounts to content-based regulation which must be prospective, or must &quot;grandfather-in&quot; existing uses, is rejected.  Since the ordinance is content -neutral under both the Federal and State Constitutions, the amortization provisions rest upon the same legal foundation as such provisions generally and, on the facts presented, are valid.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found the firefighter entitled to benefits and remanded the matter to the board for a calculation of the back pay due. On the board's appeal, the court held that: (1) an evaluation of statutory history and language revealed that N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 207-a and N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 363-a represented separate disability systems with differing coverages and consequences; (2) the legislature had refused to amend into N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 207-a the presumption that fire fighters incurred in the line of duty any condition of impairment of health caused by diseases of the heart resulting in disability or death; (3) the addition of such a line-of-duty presumption to N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 363-a did not operate to effect a similar implicit amendment to N.Y. Gen. Mun.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The line-of-duty presumption for firefighters' heart-related retirement disability benefits (Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 363-a [1]) should not be read into General Municipal Law &sect; 207-a, which generally governs firefighters' sick leave benefits.  It cannot be assumed that the Legislature made a significant addition to General Municipal Law &sect; 207-a by amending the Retirement and Social Security Law without acknowledging it somewhere.  Sections 207-a and 363-a represent separate disability systems with differing coverage and consequences.  From the face of the statutes, the 1973 amendment to section 363-a, which added to that section the line-of-duty presumption for New York City paid firefighters contained in General Municipal Law &sect; 207-k, was not intended to increase the scope of coverage under section 207-a; it surely did not do so unambiguously.  Moreover, the legislative history of the 1973 amendment contains no reference to General Municipal Law &sect; 207-a, and does not evidence a legislative intent to apply the job-related disability presumption of section 363-a to section 207-a.  Accordingly, the line-of-duty presumption of section 363-a (1) need not be read into an application by petitioner firefighter for sick leave benefits under section 207-a based upon petitioner's affliction with coronary artery disease and angina.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appeals from decisions of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) denying summary judgment to defendant drug manufacturers in products liability action arising from injuries plaintiffs suffered as result of plaintiffs' mothers' use of diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sued defendant drug manufacturers in three product liability actions, alleging injuries from use of diethylstilbestrol (DES) by plaintiffs' mothers during pregnancy. In all three cases, the trial court denied defendants summary judgment, and the appeals court affirmed. On appeal, defendant drug manufacturers argued that summary judgment was proper because plaintiffs could not identify the manufacturer of the drug that allegedly injured them and that state law, which revived time-barred DES claims, violated constitutional due process and equal protection principles. The court affirmed, adopting a national market-share theory for apportioning liability, and holding the statute was rationally based and constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In actions to recover damages for injuries allegedly sustained by plaintiffs due to their mothers' ingestion during pregnancy of the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was manufactured by defendants, liability and apportionment of damages in cases in which identification of the manufacturer of the specific drug that injured the plaintiff is impossible is to be determined by application of a market share theory, using a national market.  Liability should be apportioned so as to correspond to the over-all culpability of each defendant, measured by the amount of risk of injury each defendant created to the public-at-large; a defendant cannot be held liable if it did not participate in the marketing of DES for pregnancy use.  Use of a national market is a fair method of apportioning defendants' liabilities according to their total culpability in marketing DES for use during pregnancy. Under the circumstances, this is an equitable way to provide plaintiffs with the relief they deserve, while also rationally distributing the responsibility for plaintiffs' injuries among defendants.  Further, the liability of DES producers is several only, and should not be inflated when all participants in the market are not before the court in a particular case.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Laws of 1986 (ch 682, &sect; 4) is not unconstitutional as a denial of due process under the State and Federal Constitutions </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, NY Const, art I, &sect; 6; US Const, 14th Amend, &sect; 1) insofar as it revived, for the period of one year, actions for damages caused by the latent effects of the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES).  The Legislature may constitutionally revive a personal cause of action where the circumstances are exceptional and are such as to satisfy the court that serious injustice would result to plaintiffs not guilty of any fault if the intentions of the Legislature were not affected.  The latent nature of DES injuries is well known, and it is clear that in the past the court-maintained exposure rule for toxic substances prevented the bringing of timely actions for recovery.  Thus, exceptional circumstances are presented, an injustice has been rectified, and the highest standard for determining whether the Legislature's revival of a personal cause of action satisfies due process has been met.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Laws of 1986 (ch 682, &sect; 4), insofar as it revived, for a period of one year, actions for damages caused by the latent effects of the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES), is not unconstitutional as applied to cases in which the plaintiff could have sued before the original limitations period ran, but did not.  Some plaintiffs may have known of their exposure, but did not develop injuries during the limitations period.  Others may have known of some effect upon them of DES exposure, which became cancerous only after any action would have been time barred.  Under these circumstances, the Legislature properly determined that it would be more fair for all plaintiffs to uniformly now have one year to bring their actions, rather than for the courts to begin drawing arbitrary lines transecting this area's shades of gray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Limitation of Actions -- Revival of Time-Barred Action -- Constitutionality of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Reviving Claims for Exposure to Specified Toxic Substances -- Equal Protection of Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Laws of 1986 (ch 682, &sect; 4), which revived, for a period of one year, actions for damages caused by the latent effects of five substances, does not violate equal protection </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, NY Const, art I, &sect; 11; US Const, 14th Amend, &sect; 1) because the Legislature designated only those five substances for revival including the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES), while instituting a prospective only discovery rule for other substances.  That this categorization is the result of &quot;political compromise&quot; is no basis for finding the revival statute unconstitutional, since most, if not all legislation is the product of some compromise.  Further, as it pertains to DES, the revival statute has a rational basis, and the Legislature acted within its broad range of discretion in enacting the law.  The number of DES-caused injuries was relatively well known by the Legislature, which allowed for the ramifications of revival of DES claims, such as the effect on insurance interests, and the other costs, to be reasonably predicted.  It was also well known that DES victims were prejudiced under current law.  This is enough of a basis for the Legislature to revive DES claims now, and wait as to other substances until it is felt that these substances present a problem suitable for resolution.  The Legislature does not violate equal protection by providing a rational piecemeal remedy for what may be a larger problem.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Products Liability -- Alternative Liability Doctrine -- Actions Involving Unidentifiable Manufacturers of DES for Pregnancy Use</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In actions to recover damages for injuries allegedly sustained by plaintiffs due to their mothers' ingestion during pregnancy of the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was manufactured by defendants, the doctrine of alternative liability is unavailable as a basis for recovery where identification of the producer of the specific drug that caused the injury is impossible.  Use of the alternative liability doctrine generally requires that the defendants have better access to information than does the plaintiff, and that all possible tort-feasors be before the court; further, alternative liability rests on the notion that where there is a small number of possible wrongdoers, all of whom breached a duty to the plaintiff, the likelihood that any one of them injured the plaintiff is relatively high, so that forcing them to exonerate themselves, or be held liable, is not unfair.  However, in DES cases, the defendants are not in any better position than are plaintiffs to identify the manufacturer of the DES ingested in any given case, nor is there any real prospect of having all the possible producers before the court.  Moreover, the fairness of employing alternative liability in cases involving only a small number of potential wrongdoers disappears with the decreasing probability that any one of the defendants actually caused the injury, particularly where, as here, the chance that a particular producer caused the injury is often very remote.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Products Liability -- Concerted Action Doctrine --</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Actions Involving Unidentifiable Manufacturers of DES for Pregnancy Use</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In actions to recover damages for injuries allegedly sustained by plaintiffs due to their mothers' ingestion during pregnancy of the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was manufactured by defendants, the doctrine of concerted action, in its pure form, does not supply a basis for recovery where identification of the producer of the specific drug that caused the injury is impossible.  The concerted action doctrine provides for joint and several liability on the part of all defendants having an understanding, express or tacit, to participate in a common plan or design to commit a tortious act.  However, there is nothing in the record beyond the drug companies' extensive parallel conduct in developing and marketing DES to show any agreement, tacit or otherwise, to market DES for pregnancy use without taking proper steps to ensure the drug's safety.  Parallel activity, without more, is insufficient to establish the agreement element necessary to maintain a concerted action claim.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Products Liability -- Actions Involving Unidentifiable Manufacturers of DES for Pregnancy Use -- Judicial Formulation of Remedy</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In actions to recover damages for injuries allegedly sustained by plaintiffs due to their mothers' ingestion during pregnancy of the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was manufactured by defendants, where extant common-law doctrines, unmodified, do not provide a basis for recovery to a plaintiff who is unable to identify the manufacturer of the specific drug that injured her, the ever-evolving dictates of justice and fairness require formation of a remedy for injuries caused by DES; judicial action is required to overcome the inordinately difficult problems of proof caused by contemporary products and marketing techniques.  The DES situation is a singular case, with manufacturers acting in a parallel manner to produce an identical, generically marketed product, which causes injury many years later, and which has evoked a legislative response reviving previously barred actions.  Given this unusual scenario, it is more appropriate that the loss be borne by those that produced the drug for use during pregnancy, rather than by those who were injured by the use, even where the precise manufacturer of the drug cannot be identified in a particular action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Products Liability --</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Concerted Action Doctrine -- Substitution of Conscious Parallel Activity for Proof of Actual Agreement -- Prescription Drug Manufacturers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. In actions to recover damages for injuries allegedly sustained by plaintiffs due to their mothers' ingestion during pregnancy of the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES), which was manufactured by defendants, a modified version of the concerted action doctrine, which, in effect, substitutes the fact of conscious parallel activity by manufacturers for the usual common-law requirement that there be proof of an actual agreement between actors to jointly act tortiously, does not provide a basis for recovery where identification of the manufacturer of the specific drug that caused the injury is impossible.  Parallel behavior, the major justification for visiting liability caused by the product of one manufacturer upon the head of another under this analysis, is a common occurrence in industry generally.  Therefore, inferring agreement from the fact of parallel activity alone improperly expands the concept of concerted action beyond a rational or fair limit; among other things, it potentially renders small manufacturers, in the case of DES and in countless other industries, jointly liable for all damages stemming from the defective products of an entire industry.  </SPAN></P>

The state appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of marijuana and a gun, which were recovered in a search of his girlfriend's house. At trial, defendant's motion to suppress this evidence was denied for lack of standing, and defendant was convicted. The appellate court reversed defendant's conviction and dismissed the indictment, holding that since he had been charged with constructive possession of the contraband, he could not be deprived of standing to challenge the legality of the search. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that a defendant seeking to challenge a search and seizure could not rest upon the fact that the people had charged him with possession, but was required to demonstrate a personal legitimate expectation of privacy in the searched premises. Since the lower court did not address whether defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy, the court remitted for consideration of this issue.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Standing -- Constructive Possession</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A defendant does not have standing to challenge a search that results in the discovery of contraband, based solely on his alleged constructive possession of that contraband; the defendant has the burden of demonstrating a personal legitimate expectation of privacy in the searched premises at the pretrial stage, protected by the rule that such testimony cannot be used to prove the charges.  There is no anomaly endemic to constructive possession cases that requires departure from the long-established rule in New York that a defendant seeking suppression must assert personal standing.  Further, the rule that a defendant who is charged with possession of a gun based on the statutory presumption in Penal Law &sect; 265.15 (3), which attributes possession of a gun to the passengers in an automobile simply by their presence in the car where the gun is found, has a right to challenge the legality of the search regardless of whether the defendant is able to assert a cognizable Fourth Amendment interest, should not be extended to permit all defendants charged with constructive possession to claim standing for that reason alone.  Accordingly, in the prosecution of defendant, who was charged with constructive possession of marihuana and weapons which were seized following the search of a house occupied by his girlfriend, defendant's claim of standing to seek suppression of the contraband, based solely on the fact that he is charged with constructive possession, is insufficient under the law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To correct an error in the drawing of boundaries for a sewer system, the town submitted a request to the legislature for a home rule law. The legislature enacted chapter 755 to describe the property in the improvement area. The landowners, whose property was within the boundary, challenged the town's assessment, alleging that chapter 755 was invalid. The appellate court reversed the trial court's dismissal, and declared chapter 755 unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the order, holding that the landowners were not entitled to notice or a hearing. The landowners were only entitled to notice and a hearing if a subordinate body, rather than the legislature, fixed the district boundaries. Because chapter 755 established the sewer boundaries, the landowners were not deprived due process. The court rejected the landowners' argument that chapter 755 was unconstitutional because the town created facts to support its request, holding that there was no judicial review of the validity of an act passed in accordance with a home rule request.

In a &quot;legislative&quot; proceeding, as here, where district boundaries are established by statute as an incident of the Legislature's power to determine that a public improvement should be made and to define the district to be benefited, a landowner is not entitled to notice or a hearing prior to the creation of a district that includes its property.  Moreover, petitioners' contention that the statute is unconstitutional on the ground that there was no genuine basis for the Town Board's request for the enactment of a special law is expressly foreclosed by Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 40 and Legislative Law &sect; 56; given these statutes, which are unchallenged, it must be accepted that the Legislature by its own act of adopting chapter 755 has certified that all requisite steps necessary for the passage of the law were properly carried out.

In a prosecution for criminally negligent homicide, arising out of a motor vehicle accident in which the victim was killed when the automobile she was driving was struck by two vehicles, one operated by defendant and the other by his codefendant, who were engaged in a high-speed race, the Trial Justice exercised her discretion within permissible legal limits when she ordered two juries (one as to each defendant) and the procedure did not prejudice the defense.  The right to trial by jury is guaranteed by both Federal and State Constitutions (US Const 6th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 2) and implemented by statute (CPL arts 260, 270), and there is nothing in the Constitutions, the statutes or decisions interpreting them, which expressly authorizes or prohibits the use of multiple juries in New York.  The court's power to employ multiple juries, while not explicit in the statute, may logically be implied from its terms.  In this case the People's evidence against the two defendants was the same except for defendant's inculpatory statement to a bystander.  Under the circumstances, the harm to defendant, if any, resulting from the use of separate juries was little more than that occurring in the usual joint trial and existed only because of the logistics of managing two separate juries. The risk of error arising from the procedure was clearly outweighed by judicial economy, witness convenience and the possibility of prejudice or inconsistent verdicts which might result from sequential trials.  Multiple juries should be used sparingly and then only after a full consideration of the impact the procedure will have on the defendant's due process rights and after thorough precautions have been taken to protect those rights; the Trial Justice properly did so in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Criminally Negligent Homicide -- Sufficiency of Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a prosecution for criminally negligent homicide, arising out of a motor vehicle accident in which the victim was killed when her automobile was struck by two vehicles, one operated by defendant and the other by his codefendant, who were engaged in a high-speed race, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the People, supported the jury's guilty verdict.  Contrary to defendant's contention, the People proved more than excessive speed in this case.  There was evidence introduced that defendant failed to observe a vehicle plainly visible in front of him or take steps to avoid it, and that his failure was caused by engaging in a race with another car on a busy divided highway in a metropolitan area. This evidence is sufficient to support the jury's verdict finding defendant guilty of criminally negligent homicide for failing to perceive a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death would result from his conduct </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Penal Law &sect;&sect; 125.10, 15.05 [4]).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner broker appealed an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), dismissing his petition claiming that the nonsolicitation order prohibiting blockbusting and regulation restricting license relocation, both issued by respondent Secretary of State of the State of New York, were unconstitutional. The court applied N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 296(3-b) and N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 441-a(5).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The secretary issued a nonsolicitation order that prohibited brokers and salespersons of real estate from soliciting for sale residential realty. The secretary promulgated the regulation restricting the number of licensed brokers permitted to operate in areas. The broker petitioned for a declaratory ruling to eliminate those provisions, but the supreme court upheld them as constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the supreme court's order and directed that the petition be granted to invalidate the regulation. The court rendered the decision on this ground and did not reach other or constitutional issues. The court found the order exceeded the statutory prohibition on blockbusting by administratively limiting all broker-initiated solicitation, not just the illegal solicitation banned by the legislature in &sect; 296(3-b). The court also found the secretary made unlawful what the legislature had not made unlawful, which exceeded her statutory mandate and exercised a power that she lacked. The regulation establishing the requirement of preapproval by the secretary to the broker's relocation, which imposed conditions, exceeded the notification function of &sect; 441-a(5) and was invalid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An order of the respondent Secretary of State which interdicts real estate brokers and salespersons from soliciting for sale residential realty in eastern Bronx County in furtherance of the Legislature's declared policy to ban blockbusting (Executive Law &sect; 296 [3-b]) exceeded whatever authority the Secretary did have to regulate broker untrustworthiness flowing from unlawful discriminatory practice of blockbusting, as the Legislature has defined it, and the order is, therefore, invalid. The Legislature has explicitly enumerated the types of solicitation it views as forbidden blockbusting activity in section 296 (3-b).  The nonsolicitation order at issue leaps well beyond that legislative articulation and interdicts administratively all broker-initiated solicitation, not just the illegal solicitation as targeted by the Legislature.  Thus, the Secretary has gone beyond administering the written law and has, under color of regulatory authority, actually rewritten and extended the law.  The agency cannot make unlawful what the Legislature still has on the books as lawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the court initially reversed the appellate court's order, the United States Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari, vacated the court's judgment and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of the commission's proposed new regulations.

Upon reargument, the court adhered to its previous decision which reversed the appellate court's order reversing the trial court's grant of a preliminary injunction to the truckers. The court declined to express an opinion on whether the statutes as implemented by the new regulations generally met constitutional standards because a decision on their validity would have constituted an advisory opinion involving hypothetical future transactions of unknown parties. The court further declined an invitation to consider the validity of the commission's assessments in light of the Hayden-Cartwright Act, 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 104 because the statute was not cited on prior appeal to the court, not urged as a ground for reversal before the Supreme Court, and not identified as a matter for consideration on remand.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon reargument of an appeal, following remand by the United States Supreme Court, concerning the question whether the State may require the corporate plaintiff, a wholesale distributor of motor fuel to Seneca Indians on the Allegany and Cattaraugus Reservations, to prepay taxes on motor fuel delivered to the retailers for resale to Indian and non-Indian consumers, the Court of Appeals adheres to its prior determination that the Federal Indian trader laws preempted State regulation of the corporate plaintiff and that the Appellate Division erred, therefore, in denying the corporate plaintiff's application for an order preliminarily enjoining defendant State Tax Commission from proceeding against it.  Inasmuch as the Supreme Court remanded the case for the Court of Appeals to reconsider its decision in light of new regulations proposed by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance not before the Court of Appeals on the prior appeal, which apply only to sales of motor fuels after January 1, 1989, and it is not apparent from the record that plaintiff will continue to sell to the Indians, a decision on the validity of the new regulations upon the present record, even assuming there were no factual issues to be determined when applying them, would constitute an advisory opinion involving hypothetical future transactions of unknown parties.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals expresses no opinion on whether the statutes as implemented by the new regulations generally meet constitutional standards.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a math teacher engaged in inappropriate sexual contact with pupils.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Corroboration as to Sex Offenses -- Ex Post Facto Law -- Retroactive Application of Law Repealing Corroboration Requirements for Underage Victims</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution (US Const, art I, &sect; 10; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see also</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, art I, &sect; 9, cl 3) does not preclude the application of the legislative enactment repealing the statutory provisions requiring corroboration of the victim's testimony in certain sex-crime prosecutions involving underage victims (L 1984, ch 89, amending Penal Law &sect;&sect; 130.16, 260.11) to prosecutions for crimes occurring before its effective date.  Thus, in the prosecution of defendant for various sex-related crimes committed against young children,  there was no constitutional impediment to applying the new statute and convicting defendant solely on the basis of the victims' testimony, even though the charged crimes occurred before the repealing legislation became effective.  Defendant had ample notice that the conduct in which he engaged was prohibited and that, if convicted, he could be punished within certain legislatively prescribed guidelines.  He had no legitimate right to rely on a procedural rule that affected neither his culpability nor his expected punishment but instead merely made the prosecution's case against him more difficult to prove.  The repeal of the corroboration rule did nothing more than remove an obstacle arising out of a rule of evidence.  Further, there is no claim that the legislative decision to repeal the corroboration rule applicable to defendant's case was arbitrary, vindictive or oppressive or that it was intended to single out defendant for particularly unfavorable treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Proof of Other Crimes -- Prosecution for Sex-Related Crimes Involving Children -- Admissibility of Evidence of Prior Accusations of Sexual Misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Evidence of a defendant's prior criminal or immoral conduct has some minimal probative worth because of its tendency to demonstrate the defendant's bad character and general criminal propensity, but it is excluded as a matter of law when it has no additional relevance to a specific issue, because there is a very real danger that the trier of fact will overestimate its significance.  Accordingly, in the prosecution of defendant, an elementary school teacher, for various sex-related crimes involving students under the age of 11, evidence concerning the accusations of a former student with respect to sexual misconduct by defendant, which were made more than one year before the accusations underlying the present prosecution were made, should have been excluded since it had no relevance to any material issue in the case and tended only to demonstrate defendant's general criminal propensity. The testimony of the former student was offered to show that the children's charges against defendant were not simply the product of rumor. However, while proof that the former student came forward and accused defendant of sexual misconduct before any rumors occurred, and may therefore have been telling the truth, may tend to support the credibility of that student's accusation, it throws no light upon the truthfulness of the other children who subsequently accused defendant -- except of course to the extent that defendant's misconduct toward the former student makes it more likely that he also engaged in similar misconduct with others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Harmless and Prejudicial Error -- Proof of Other Crimes -- Evidence of Prior Accusations of Sexual Misconduct in Prosecution for Sex-Related Crimes Involving Children</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In the prosecution of defendant, an elementary school teacher, for various sex-related crimes involving students under the age of 11, evidence concerning accusations by a former student of sexual misconduct by defendant, made more than one year before the accusations underlying the present prosecution, which was admitted in violation of the rule prohibiting the admission of evidence of defendant's bad character and general criminal propensity when it has no additional relevance to a specific issue, was highly prejudicial and therefore not harmless, despite the fact that eight other boys recounted essentially the same story.  The evidence of accusations by the former student was qualitatively different from the  testimony of the other boys, in that it was not subject to impeachment under the defense's theory that the current charges were the product of a rumor. Because of the relative strength of this evidence, particularly as it was bolstered by other corroborative testimony, there is a serious danger that the jury used it to draw the impermissible inference (&quot;he did it before, so he probably did it this time too&quot;) and to resolve any doubts it might otherwise have had about the other boys' stories in the People's favor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Evidence -- Extrinsic Proof of Reason to Fabricate -- Examination of Police Officers Who Questioned Child-Witnesses in Prosecution for Sex-Related Crimes -- Suggestive Comments by Police</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Although trial courts have broad discretion to keep the proceedings within manageable limits and to curtail exploration of collateral matters, extrinsic proof tending to establish a reason to fabricate is never collateral and may not be excluded on that ground.  Further, the trial court's discretion in this area is circumscribed by the defendant's constitutional rights to present a defense and confront his accusers.  Accordingly, in the prosecution of defendant for various sex-related crimes involving boys under the age of 11, defendant was improperly denied the right to present his case in violation of both the constitutional and evidentiary rules by the trial court's ruling foreclosing examination of the two investigating police officers about the manner in which the child-witnesses were first questioned. The trial court's conclusion that the proposed line of questioning was &quot;collateral&quot; is obviously flawed, since the questioning concerned more than the credibility of the People's witnesses in general and went instead to a possible reason for fabrication by these impressionable witnesses -- i.e., the investigators' suggestive comments.  That defendant had a limited opportunity to explore the matter during his cross-examination of the child-witnesses does not cure the error in the court's evidentiary ruling.  Further, the information defense counsel sought to elicit from the investigating officers was not duplicative of the admissions he elicited from some of the child-witnesses that they had changed their stories after police questioning.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Harmless and Prejudicial Error -- Evidence -- Foreclosure of Examination of Police Officers Who</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Questioned Child-Witnesses in Prosecution Involving Sex-Related Crimes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In the prosecution of defendant for various sex-related crimes involving boys under the age of 11, the trial court's error in denying defendant the right to present his case by foreclosing examination of the two investigating police officers about the manner in which the child-witnesses were first questioned cannot be considered harmless.  The issue of the manner in which the police had interviewed all of the young victims and the possibility that there had been a degree of suggestiveness in their approach went to the heart of defendant's case.  The limited questioning which the court permitted concerning the manner in which one of the witnesses had been interviewed was no substitute for the broader inquiry that was improperly precluded.  Further, because defendant was precluded from questioning the police officers about the manner in which the boys had been interviewed, his ability to develop the defense theory was seriously curtailed and the prosecutor was placed in a position to argue on summation that any defense contention concerning the victims' motive to falsify was purely speculative.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sentence as a second felony offender, upon his conviction of attempted robbery, pursuant to his guilty plea. Defendant was determined to be a second felony offender based on his prior conviction for drug crimes. At his first trial, the judge closed the courtroom to the public when an undercover officer testified. After defendant's first conviction became final, that practice was held to be reversible error. Court rejected defendant's argument that his first conviction was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights and therefore could not serve as a predicate conviction for enhancement purposes. Court held that the standard applied was whether the conviction satisfied constitutional standards defined by the law up until the time that the conviction became final. Finding that defendant's conviction was constitutional at the time it was obtained and could serve as a predicate felony, court affirmed order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court affirmed judgment against defendant, holding that for sentence enhancement purposes, a conviction must have been constitutional under the laws as defined until the conviction became final and that a later change in the law would not prevent conviction from being used as a predicate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Second Felony Offender -- What Constitutes Prior Conviction &quot;Unconstitutionally Obtained&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">For purposes of determining whether a prior conviction &quot;was unconstitutionally obtained&quot; ( CPL 400.21 [7] [b]) -- and thus may not be counted for predicate felony purposes -- the proper inquiry is to determine whether the conviction was obtained in violation of the defendant's rights as defined by the law at the time of the conviction or by present law which is properly applied to it under recognized principles of retroactivity. Under those principles of retroactivity, a defendant is entitled to the benefit of any change in the  law if the change occurs before his conviction becomes final or, if the right at stake is such that the law has engrafted an exception to the traditional rule to permit collateral attack on judgments of conviction after they have become final.  Thus, defendant's sentence as a second felony offender may be predicated upon a 1971 conviction which satisfied constitutional standards when obtained and has survived postconviction collateral attack, but was obtained by means which, if the indictment were tried now, would violate defendant's rights to a public trial under US Constitution 6th Amendment as presently applied by the courts.  Defendant's 1971 conviction meets neither of the retroactivity criteria.  It was not obtained in violation of defendant's rights because the closure of the courtroom during his trial complied with the existing legal requirements for a public trial as was held on defendant's direct appeal. That a similar procedure was subsequently declared unconstitutional in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Jones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (47 NY2d 409) does not make the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jones</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rule retroactive to prior convictions that have survived direct appeal, nor does it, in view of the plain language of CPL 400.21 (7) (b), require a finding that the predicate conviction &quot;was unconstitutionally obtained.&quot; </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee juvenile sought appellant Department of Probation's (Probation) compliance with the requirements of N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 375.1 to keep the records of his favorably terminated cases sealed and not to reveal the existence and contents of those materials. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of juvenile. Probation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Probation reviewed sealed information of favorably terminated matters concerning juvenile and supplied protected data from its own records to the family court. Juvenile argued that Probation's actions violated N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 375.1. Probation claimed the invoked sealing provisions were inapplicable because it did not derive any information submitted to the family court from a review of sealed court records, but rather acquired the data from indexed case record materials or from an administrative folder it maintained for itself. The court determined that the Family Court Act was plain and unambiguous. The court concluded that Probation violated the sealing provisions of &sect; 375.1 by releasing information concerning cases terminated in juvenile's favor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The sealing provisions of Family Court Act &sect; 375.1 are violated when a public agency, privy to and maintaining records and information concerning cases terminated in a juvenile's favor, divulges information resurrected from otherwise sealed records.  However, the background facts to such matters, if relevant and material, may be disclosed in an Investigation and Report (I &amp; R), a document prepared to assist a Family Court Judge in determining the appropriate disposition after adjudication of juvenile delinquency charges, if derived from sources other than sealed records and materials.  Accordingly, where the New York City Department of Probation (Probation) reviewed sealed information of favorably terminated matters concerning petitioner juvenile and supplied protected data from its own separately maintained records to the Family Court in an updated I &amp; R in connection with the disposition of petitioner's latest brush with the law, Probation violated the sealing protections of Family Court Act &sect; 375.1 and the implementing judicial sealing orders.  It is of no consequence that the source of the arrest and prosecution data, included within the I &amp; R, was Probation's own indexed case record materials, cumulative case records, or administrative records.  Indeed, this makes matters worse and more disturbing because it unmasks a concededly regularized evasion of the prophylactic law itself and of particular sealing orders.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent superintendent of insurance appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) entered in petitioner nonprofit association's N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 action that affirmed a decision annulling a determination by the superintendent of insurance that established primary and excess premium rates for medical malpractice insurance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A nonprofit association that provided medical malpractice insurance challenged the premium rates set by the superintendent of insurance pursuant to section 40 of the temporary insurance rate-stabilization program, 1986 N.Y. Laws, ch. 266, &sect; 40. The nonprofit association contended that the state superintendent of insurance's interpretation of &sect; 40 was unreasonable and resulted in rates that were not actuarially sound, that the rates were confiscatory, and that the rates would result in an unconstitutional taking of property. The lower court set aside the superintendent of insurance's determination, and an appellate court affirmed. On further appeal, the court reversed. The superintendent of insurance's determination that anticipated future surcharges, which were designated as income earned, should be considered both in determining present rates and in calculating the solvency of the nonprofit association was reasonable and should be sustained. A disagreement among actuaries was not evidence that acceptance of one set of conclusions was arbitrary, and the use of certain assumptions did not render the conclusions irrational.</SPAN></P>

The superintendent of insurance's interpretation of the law was reasonable, and the conclusions reached were not arbitrary or capricious.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- Malpractice Insurance -- Rate Setting -- Solvency of Medical</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Malpractice Insurance Association -- Consideration of Anticipated Future Surcharges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The respondent Superintendent of Insurance's interpretation of section 40 of the Medical Malpractice Reform Act of 1986 (L 1986, ch 266) so as to consider anticipated future surcharges, which are designated as income earned, both in determining present rates for medical malpractice insurance and in calculating the solvency of petitioner Medical Malpractice Insurance Association as required by Insurance Law &sect;&sect; 2303 and 5505, is reasonable.  If future surcharges were not to be accounted for until actually received beginning in 1989, then the last sentence of section 40, which provides that &quot;[the] surcharges authorized herein shall be deemed to be income earned&quot; for the purposes of Insurance Law &sect; 2303, would be superfluous, since moneys actually received would undoubtedly be deemed income earned at that time.  Thus, the Legislature must have intended that the future surcharges be considered on an accrual basis similar to the treatment of investment income. Further, it is clear that temporary rate stabilization is designed to complement the numerous remedial measures codified in 1985 and 1986 (L 1985, ch 294; L 1986, ch 266).  Section 40 is designed to bridge the gap and allow the other reforms to start taking effect.  Moreover, if the Superintendent cannot account for future surcharges in calculating present rates, section 40 would mean nothing and do nothing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- Malpractice Insurance -- Setting of Primary and Excess Premium Rates -- Rational Basis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Respondent Superintendent of Insurance's reliance upon his actuary's calculations in setting the 1985 through 1988 primary and excess premium rates for medical malpractice insurance was not arbitrary or capricious.  Actuarial data existed, and the Superintendent's rate decisions were based on such data.  Although the parties' actuaries disagreed on almost everything, a disagreement among actuaries is not evidence that the Superintendent's acceptance of one set of conclusions was arbitrary.  Nor does the Superintendent's use of assumptions in his computation, including future interest rates, projected decreases in severity of claims due to accompanying legislative reforms, and the Superintendent's willingness to permit &quot;adequate&quot; increases beginning in 1988-1989 and the following years, render his conclusions irrational.  Moreover, there is an adequate rational basis for the rates set by the Superintendent for layers of excess coverage.  These rates were fixed as percentages of the rates approved for primary coverage, and the Superintendent's actuarial witness testified that, while excess programs at inadequate rate would increase the deficit, there would be greater surcharge income in future years, and that the two would offset each other.  Further, the Regulatory Impact Statement, of which the court can take judicial notice ( CPLR 4511 [b], [c]) and which the Superintendent filed during the pendency of the case before the Supreme Court, explains how the same factors used by the actuaries in setting primary rates were also used in setting excess rates, and consequently supplies an adequate rational basis for the excess rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- Malpractice Insurance -- Rate Setting Which Results in Deficit for Medical Malpractice Insurance Association -- Rational Basis</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. That the respondent Superintendent of Insurance's interpretation of section 40 of the Medical Malpractice Reform Act (L 1986, ch 266) and his actuarial projections with respect to the setting of the 1985 through 1988  primary and excess premium rates for medical malpractice insurance may require petitioner Medical Malpractice Insurance Association (MMIA) to run at a continued deficit until the surcharges imposed pursuant to section 40 result in recoupment of that deficit in approximately the year 2000, does not render the Superintendent's decision arbitrary and capricious.  This 15-year period for recoupment is not unreasonable, since according to respondent's chief actuary, the established rates coupled with the 8% surcharge after 1989 will enable MMIA to remain liquid and pay claims as they come due, at least through the year 2010.  More importantly, medical malpractice claims are &quot;long-tailed&quot;, so that claims made on policies written between 1985 and 1988 will not, on average, be payable until after 1995 through 1998.  Thus, it is entirely conceivable that the deficit will be made up while some losses attributable to policies written and premiums collected in 1985 through 1988 are still unpaid.  The combination of the &quot;long-tailed&quot; nature of medical malpractice claims along with the other statutory reforms promulgated under the 1985 and 1986 acts makes the long-term deficit entirely reasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Insurance -- Malpractice Insurance -- Rate Setting Which Results in Deficit for Medical Malpractice Insurance Association -- Confiscatory Taking</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In a CPLR article 78 proceeding challenging the approach adopted by the Superintendent of Insurance in setting the 1985 through 1988 primary and excess premium rates for medical malpractice insurance, the claim of petitioner Medical Malpractice Insurance Association (MMIA) that section 40 of the Medical Malpractice Reform Act (L 1986, ch 266) is confiscatory as to it (US Const 5th, 14th Amends; NY Const, art I, &sect;&sect; 6, 7) is rejected.  MMIA is a creature of statute, and all of its rights, obligations and duties have been defined by the Legislature.  Thus, since MMIA is a statutory entity created by the Legislature, the State's broad police power can be implemented to foster affordable medical malpractice coverage, with the possibility that MMIA will operate under a deficit. Indeed, such deficits were expressly contemplated in the enabling legislation.  In this regard, even if MMIA will operate at a continued loss, such a loss is not confiscatory vis-a-vis MMIA.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the supreme court convicting defendant after a bench trial of murder in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of killing his girlfriend. The evidence against him included a statement he made in the police station approximately an hour after the police arrested him in his apartment without a warrant. Defendant contended that the statement should have been suppressed because it was obtained in violation of constitutional guarantees against illegal searches and seizures. After considering three factors to determine if a confession was the product of free will after an illegal arrest, the court held that defendant's statement must be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree. The causal link between the illegality and the confession was not attenuated. Defendant's statement one hour after the illegal arrest, coupled with the continuous police presence, indicated that the station house statement was no less a product of a U.S. Const. amend. IV violation than was the statement defendant made in his apartment. Moreover, the police illegality was knowing and intentional. They made no attempt to obtain a warrant even though five days had elapsed from the time of the killing and defendant's arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the appellate division, suppressed defendant's statement, and ordered a new trial.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where defendant was given </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings and freely made a written statement in the police station approximately one hour after the police had illegally arrested him in his apartment without a warrant, that statement should have been suppressed on Fourth Amendment grounds since the causal connection between the illegal arrest and the statement was not sufficiently attenuated. The temporal relationship between the illegal arrest and the statement is, at best, ambiguous; standing alone, it cannot serve to attenuate the illegality. Further, the short time period and the continuous police presence with defendant from the time he was arrested until the time he gave his statement, without any legally significant intervening event, indicate that the station house statement was no less a product of the Fourth Amendment violation than was the prior statement defendant made in his apartment which the courts below suppressed. Reading defendant his </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rights again, standing alone, could not attenuate the link between the Fourth Amendment violation and the statement.  Nor does a consideration of the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct support a finding of attenuation. The police deliberately made an illegal arrest, according to the practice of that police department not to get warrants before making arrests in the home, to obtain a confession of defendant; there was no intervening event sufficient to attenuate that illegality. Moreover, the taint of the illegal arrest was not attenuated because the police had probable cause to make the arrest. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner, who was convicted of sodomy in the first degree while on parole after serving approximately 3 1/2 years of the sentence imposed upon his 1975 conviction for robbery, which was subsequently reversed as having been unconstitutionally obtained and the indictment  dismissed, is not entitled pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 70.30 (3) to credit for the time he served on the invalid robbery conviction toward satisfaction of the sentence imposed upon the sodomy conviction.  The last paragraph of Penal Law &sect; 70.30 (3), the so-called &quot;dismissal-acquittal paragraph&quot;, provides that where a person has been in custody due to a charge that culminated in a dismissal or an acquittal, the amount of time that would have been credited against a sentence for such charge, had one been imposed, shall be credited against any sentence that is based on a charge for which a warrant or commitment was lodged during the pendency of such custody. The legislative history of Penal Law &sect; 70.30 establishes that the term &quot;custody&quot; was intended to mean &quot;confinement&quot; or &quot;detention&quot; under guard and not &quot;constructive custody&quot; such as release on parole or bail. Further, the &quot;dismissal-acquittal paragraph&quot; clearly envisions that the &quot;dismissal&quot; of the first charge occur prior to the formal commencement of any sentence imposed on that charge and thus does not encompass dismissals that result as a consequence of a successful appeal from a judgment of conviction. The meaning of the term  &quot;custody&quot;, therefore, cannot be said to include the status of parole. Insofar as petitioner's &quot;dismissal&quot; resulted from a successful appeal subsequent to conviction and imposition of sentence, and because the second charge -- for sodomy -- was lodged during his release on parole rather than while he was in actual custody on a pending charge, petitioner's circumstances do not fall within those contemplated by the statute, and his request for jail time credit was properly denied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, not-for-profit corporation and individuals, appealed from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) that dismissed three causes of action in the complaint. Plaintiffs sought reinstatement of their first and second causes of action in their challenge to an amendment to the New York City Zoning Resolution that established the Special Manhattan Bridge District in Chinatown.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, not-for-profit corporation and individuals, filed an action against defendants, city, various officers and agencies, and private developer, to challenge an amendment to the New York City Zoning Resolution, alleging that the amendment would displace residents who required low-income housing. The appellate division dismissed the complaint finding the first and second causes of action failed to state a claim and the third cause of action, seeking to enjoin development of a particular building, moot. On appeal, plaintiffs nevertheless contended that the amendment was invalid because the means adopted to achieve them were inadequate. The court held that the first cause of action did not state a legal claim for relief because plaintiffs failed to allege that the city failed to plan for the balanced and well-ordered development of the community. The court held that defendants had met the requirements for a well-considered plan, and plaintiffs failed to state a claim of exclusionary zoning. The court held that plaintiffs' allegations fail to state a cause of action entitling them to judicial relief and affirmed the order of the appellate division, with costs.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- &quot;Piecemeal&quot; Zoning -- Special Manhattan Bridge District</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The amendment to the New York City Zoning Resolution which established the Special Manhattan Bridge District in Chinatown is not &quot;piecemeal&quot; legislation.  Piecemeal zoning exists when only part of the land within a municipality is regulated by the  zoning laws.  However, the entire City of New York is zoned; the Special Manhattan Bridge District enactment is simply one of many amendments to the City's comprehensive zoning law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Sufficiency of Allegations of Complaint Claiming Amendment to Zoning Resolution Not Part of &quot;Well Considered Plan&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action challenging an amendment to the New York City Zoning Resolution which established the Special Manhattan Bridge District in Chinatown, plaintiffs' first cause of action alleging that the amendment is &quot;not comprehensive in outlook&quot; and that the study on which it is based is not part of a well-considered plan does not state a legal claim for relief.  The pleadings refer to the amendment only in this one conclusory assertion; the remaining several paragraphs of the cause of action challenge the planning study which preceded it.  However, the validity of the amendment is not dependent solely upon the adequacy of the study of the Manhattan Bridge area, but on all the City's zoning policies and plans and nowhere in the complaint have plaintiffs alleged that the City has failed to plan for the balanced and well-ordered development of the community or that it has neglected to zone the City to provide for the needs of its inhabitants or those in the region.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Constitutionality of Amendment to Zoning Resolution -- &quot;Well Considered Plan&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The power to zone must be exercised in the case of cities in accord with a &quot;well considered plan&quot; (General City Law &sect; 20 [25]).  If a zoning ordinance is adopted for a legitimate governmental purpose and there is a reasonable relation between the end sought to be achieved by the regulation and the means used to achieve that end, it will be upheld.  An amendment which has been carefully studied, prepared and considered meets the general requirement for a well-considered plan and satisfies the statutory requirement.  Thus, an amendment to the New York City Zoning Resolution which established the Special Manhattan Bridge District in Chinatown is not unconstitutional because it was not enacted pursuant to a well-considered plan.  This legislation was reasonably related to its goals: the development of needed housing and the rehabilitation of existing housing in one area of Chinatown.  There is no allegation that it was not consistent with the City's general planning or that the City had failed to make provision for low-cost housing. That being so, and inasmuch as the amendment was enacted after study and consideration, it met the requirements for a well-considered plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Exclusionary Zoning -- Special Manhattan Bridge District</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In an action challenging an amendment to the New York City Zoning Resolution which established the Special Manhattan Bridge District in Chinatown for the purposes of encouraging construction of new residential facilities, rehabilitating existing structures and expanding community facilities, and which authorized development of mixed-income housing on land vacant or substantially vacant, and permitted increased density in new housing units for those developers who agree to either donate space for community facilities, construct low-income dwelling units or rehabilitate existing substandard housing, or to do a combination thereof, plaintiffs have not stated a claim of exclusionary zoning. The City does not now nor has it ever excluded low-cost housing in Chinatown or in the City generally.  Low-income families now live in the District and will continue to live there,  hopefully in rehabilitated or newly constructed low-cost housing, if the purposes of the amendment are fulfilled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Special Manhattan Bridge District -- Availability of Injunctive Relief Compelling Provision of Low-Cost Housing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In an action challenging an amendment to the New York City Zoning Resolution which established the Special Manhattan Bridge District in Chinatown for the purposes of encouraging construction of new residential facilities, rehabilitating existing structures and expanding community facilities, and which authorized development of mixed-income housing on land vacant or substantially vacant, and permitted increased density in new housing units for those developers who agreed to perform work in furtherance of the amendment's purposes, plaintiffs' cause of action alleging that the incentives offered will not provide sufficient low-cost housing and seeking a mandatory injunction compelling the City to amend the Special Manhattan Bridge District to provide low-cost housing fails to state a claim entitling them to judicial relief.  Plaintiffs seek not to overcome exclusionary practices or to correct some past inequity, but to overturn the considered decision of the executive and legislative branches of New York City's government because they believe the City's chosen remedy for this established area will prove inadequate; plaintiffs seek a rewriting of the ordinance itself.  However, those charged with the duty of addressing the problems of Chinatown chose to rezone the Manhattan Bridge area and provide housing incentives they deemed most suitable.  They have attempted to use incentive zoning to provide realistic housing opportunities which include new apartments for the poor.  Nothing in the legislative plan suggests that it will fail its purpose and plaintiffs do not allege that the solution is arbitrary or capricious or undertaken for an improper purpose, only that they would have zoned the area differently, or better, to avoid a potential future problem.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed defendant's conviction, upon his guilty plea, for reckless endangerment in the first degree, robbery in the second degree, assault in the second degree, and grand larceny in the second degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was ordered to undergo a competency examination prior to trial. Defendant was examined by two state psychiatrists and found to be competent. Defendant's privately retained psychiatrist deemed that defendant was incompetent, and so the trial judge ordered a re-examination by court-appointed psychiatrists, who had defendant committed. After defendant's brief stay at a psychiatric center, the center issued a notification to the court that defendant was no longer incapacitated. Defendant's attorney then asked the trial judge to hold a competency hearing on his own motion and the court refused, allowing defendant to make a plea of guilty. On appeal, the defense contended that the trial judge abused his discretion in proceeding without ordering a competency hearing sua sponte. On review of the appellate court decision affirming the trial court, the court held that in view of the information the trial court had before it, the court did not abuse its discretion in not ordering a competency hearing sua sponte.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the prosecution of defendant for robbery and assault in the second degree and other felonies, the trial court did not commit reversible error in refusing to conduct, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">sua sponte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, a competency-to-stand-trial hearing after the Director of Mid-Hudson Psychiatric Center certified defendant as competent following defendant's 14-day placement at the Center upon the trial court's initial finding of incapacity ( CPL 730.50).  CPL 730.60 makes no provision for an in-all-instances hearing under CPL 730.30 (4) based  on a difference between a precommitment finding of incapacity and a postcommitment declaration of fitness because the circumstances of each vary by their very nature.  Although, following a determination of fitness to proceed ( CPL 730.60 [2]), the court must conduct a hearing to determine the issue of capacity upon motion therefore by defendant ( CPL 730.30 [2]), neither defendant nor his counsel affirmatively requested a hearing.  Due process requires, in some instances, that the trial court inquire into a defendant's competence whether or not a request has been made for such an inquiry.  The statute so requires ( CPL 730.30 [2]).  Here, however, a detailed inquiry was made according to the dictates of CPL article 730 and the Judge had relevant and complete data consisting of expert evidentiary material and judicial observations before he made his factual and constitutionally satisfactory determination that defendant was competent to proceed and that an evidentiary hearing on the point was not required on the court's own motion. Moreover, defendant's extensive psychiatric record, coupled with the Trial Judge's progressive personal observations of defendant, wholly fail to establish that a &quot;sufficient doubt&quot; existed which would, independently of the applicable statutes, require the trial court to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">sua sponte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> order a hearing on constitutional due process grounds.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Residential Permit Parking System -- Power of Locality to Restrict Highway Use Based upon Residency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Albany City Ordinance No. 5.11.86, which creates a program allowing residents of certain areas of the City of Albany who purchase permits to park in their neighborhoods for periods of unlimited duration but restricts nonresident parking in such areas during weekday business hours to 90 minutes, is ultra vires and void.  Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect;&sect; 1600 and 1604 prohibit localities from excluding persons from free use of the highways except to the extent such limitations are expressly authorized by statute.  Further, case law makes clear the types of exclusions foreclosed by these statutes and reveals that in the absence of specific authorization from the Legislature, restrictions on highway use based upon residency -- such as that found in the contested ordinance -- are prohibited.  The general rule with respect to the power of localities to restrict highway &quot;use&quot;, which includes use for parking as well as travel purposes, is clear: residents of a community have no greater right to use the highways abutting their land -- whether it be for travel or parking -- than other members of the public and Albany City Ordinance No. 5.11.86, which confers special parking privileges to residents of certain neighborhoods, violates this proscription. Although the Legislature is free to create exceptions to the general rule or delegate the power to do so to the localities (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1604), it did neither here; none of the three provisions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law (&sect; 1640 [a] [6], [15], [16]), relied on by the City of Albany authorize Ordinance No. 5.11.86.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Residential Permit Parking System -- Vehicle and Traffic Law Does Not Authorize Restrictions on Highway Use Based upon Residency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action challenging the validity of Albany City Ordinance No. 5.11.86, which creates a program allowing residents of certain areas of the City of Albany who purchase permits to park in their neighborhoods for periods of unlimited duration but restricts nonresident parking in such areas during weekday business hours to 90 minutes, Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1640 (a) (6), (15) and (16) do not supersede the general rule proscribing localities from placing restrictions on highway use, whether for travel or parking, based upon residency, and none of those provisions authorize Ordinance No. 5.11.86.  Paragraph (6) generally authorizes local parking restrictions such as the 90-minute time limit found in the contested ordinance, but it does not permit discrimination between residents and nonresidents, a distinction forbidden at common law (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see also</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1200).  Paragraph (15) empowers the City of Albany to enact a prepaid parking permit program, but not one which confers preferred status to those in the community.  The omnibus provision contained in paragraph (16) does not authorize regulations at odds with the laws of the State and New York common law forbids according local residents priority in the use of public streets. Moreover, no provision in section 1640 differentiates between residents and nonresidents, and such a &quot;drastic&quot; distinction should not be upheld based upon the omnibus provision.  Finally, because the ordinance patently excludes nonresidents it violates the prohibition against discriminatory restrictions.</SPAN></P>

The question is one of power.  While the Legislature could delegate to the localities power to enact such a plan, it has not done so and the ordinance is ultra vires. </SPAN></P>

The actions of Correction Department employees in preparing and filing misbehavior reports, confining inmates, and making dispositions following Superintendent's hearings entail discretionary decisions in furtherance of general policies and purposes where the exercise of reasoned judgment can produce different acceptable results.  Thus, the actions of correction employees, in such circumstances, are quasi-judicial in nature and deserving of absolute immunity. In carrying out their duties relating to security and discipline in the difficult and sometimes highly stressful prison environment, correction employees, like other officials with quasi-judicial responsibilities, should not be inhibited because their conduct could be the basis of a damage claim.  Accordingly, in separate claims against the State by inmates in a State correctional facility seeking damages for unlawful confinement and loss of privileges resulting from the prosecution of disciplinary charges against them, an Appellate Division order affirming the dismissal of the claims by the Court of Claims, is affirmed.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the trial court convicting defendant of murder and assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the affirmation of his convictions for murder and assault, claiming that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 40.15, defining New York's affirmative defense of mental disease or defect, violated the New York State constitutional due process clause. Defendant argued that N.Y. Penal Law &sect;25.00 (2)&nbsp;unconstitutionally placed the burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence on defendants for all affirmative defenses. The court concluded that there was no state constitutional violation because placing the burden on the defendant did not relieve or transform the people's primary and constant burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, all the elements of the crimes charged, including proving all components of the applicable culpable mental state element. The court found that the people's proof and burden on the issue of criminal culpability established that defendant, at the time he fired the shots, &quot;intended&quot; his act. Defendant had a conscious objective to cause the result or to engage in the conduct, and acted &quot;recklessly,&quot; with awareness of and conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the result would occur or that the circumstances existed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Penal Law &sect; 40.15, defining New York's affirmative defense of mental disease or defect, does not violate the State constitutional Due Process Clause because Penal Law &sect; 25.00 (2) places the burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence on defendants for all affirmative defenses.  Inasmuch as placing this burden on defendants does not relieve or transform the People's primary and constant burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, all the elements of the crimes charged, including all components of the applicable culpable mental state element, there is no State constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It may be legally impossible for a person who is unable to appreciate the nature and consequences of his conduct (Penal Law &sect; 40.15) to form a &quot;conscious objective&quot; to kill the victim (Penal Law &sect; 15.05 [1]; &sect; 125.25 [1]) in cases where the concepts defined in those sections factually overlap with one another.  Then, the affirmative defense statute suffers the potential of impermissibly shifting to defendant the burden of disproving the formation of conscious objective to kill another human being, and the statute as applied could be unconstitutional.  This potentiality can be reasonably safeguarded by jury instructions which should emphasize the People's primary, ultimate, and nontransferable burden of proving all the elements of criminal intent beyond a reasonable doubt. Indeed, without transferring any burden to the defendant, the trial court should also, after the primary instructions, sequentially advise the jury that defendant bears a different burden on insanity, and that evidence of insanity relating to whether defendant knew what he was doing must be considered by the jury in its consideration of the People's nontransferable satisfaction of its burden to prove intent beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Insanity -- Mental Disease or Defect as Affirmative Defense -- Presumption of Sanity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. New York's presumption of sanity does not render unconstitutional&nbsp;Penal Law &sect; 40.15, which, in defining mental disease or defect as an affirmative defense, places the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence on a defendant asserting the affirmative defense (Penal Law &sect; 25.00 [2]).  The presumption of sanity has never relieved the People of the burden of establishing beyond a reasonable doubt defendant's pertinent culpable mental state at the time the crime was committed, including those elements that may overlap with the affirmative defense of mental disease or defect.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that simultaneously prescribing Tier III status to public employees who were preliminarily afforded Tier II rights and benefits did not constitute an unconstitutional impairment or diminution of a fixed public retirement contractual right as to those entering between July 27, 1976, the date of signing of the statute.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Laws of 1976 (ch 890), which conferred Tier II rights and benefits (Retirement and Social Security Law art 11) to public employees only until December 31, 1976, at which time they matured into Tier III benefits (Retirement and Social Security Law art 14), did not violate the protection provided by NY Constitution, article V, &sect; 7 against diminishment or impairment of pension rights, which are fixed and determined by the laws and conditions in existence at the time membership in the pension system commences, as to employees hired between July 27, 1976, the date chapter 890 was signed into law, and December 31, 1976.  The rights of public employees hired between those dates were fully established by the laws and conditions in effect when their membership commenced.  Insofar as the staggered retirement package established the rights of those who acquired membership between July 27 and December 31, 1976, the automatic shift of such employees to Tier III rights in no way constitutes a diminishment or impairment of the contractual rights conferred at the time of membership.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the trial court, resentencing defendant as a first felony offender following his conviction for robbery and related offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery and related offenses, and based on his record of prior convictions, was originally sentenced as a second felony offender. On defendant's application, however, the trial court resentenced him as a first felony offender, concluding that he was not a second felony offender within the meaning of the applicable statutes. The appellate court affirmed and the state sought review. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that defendant's conviction within the 10 years prior to his robbery conviction was properly ignored in determining whether defendant could take advantage of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.06(1)(b)(iv), which provided that convictions older then 10 years could not be used as a predicate for sentence enhancement. Defendant had two prior convictions. One conviction was more than 10 years in the past and the other was not. However, the intervening conviction had to be ignored because it was found to have been in violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, so that under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 400.21(7)(b), it could not be counted for purposes of second felony offender status. Thus, neither conviction could be used as a predicate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the appellate court that affirmed the trial court's judgment resentencing defendant as a first felony offender following his conviction for robbery and related offenses.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Second Felony Offender -- Extension of 10-Year Limitation Period for Prior Felony Conviction -- No Exclusion for Unconstitutionally Obtained Conviction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A defendant convicted of robbery and related offenses in 1982 should not be sentenced as a second felony offender based on a prior 1968 conviction, when this can only be done by taking into account the fact that the defendant was incarcerated in 1972 on another conviction which concededly was obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. The Penal Law provides that a prior felony conviction cannot serve as a predicate for enhanced punishment if the sentence was imposed more than 10 years before the commission of the felony on which the defendant presently stands convicted (Penal Law &sect; 70.06 [1] [b] [iv]), but that the period during which defendant has been incarcerated &quot;for any reason between the time of commission of the previous felony and the time of commission of the present felony&quot; shall be excluded in calculating the 10-year period (Penal Law &sect; 70.06 [1] [b] [v]).  However, CPL 400.21 (7) (b) provides that a previous conviction obtained in violation of a defendant's Federal constitutional rights &quot;must not be counted in determining whether the defendant has been subjected to a predicate felony conviction&quot;.  The various statutes provide an integrated legislative scheme, and all of the factors must be considered together to determine whether a prior conviction should be treated as a &quot;predicate felony offense&quot;.  Reading the statutes in that light, it is clear that defendant's 1968 conviction does not qualify because the 10-year limitation period had run when the defendant committed the current offenses, and it cannot be extended by taking into account defendant's incarceration on the 1972 conviction since that conviction was unconstitutionally obtained.  In short, when the statute says that incarceration &quot;for any reason&quot; extends the limitations period, it contemplates at least that the defendant has not been imprisoned without reason or unconstitutionally. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Commissioner of Health did not exceed his powers in reversing evidentiary rulings of an Administrative Officer made at a disciplinary hearing before a Committee of the State Board for Professional Medical Conduct, which rulings had effectively prevented the Committee from making a final determination in the matter.  Nothing in the legislation creating the position of Administrative Officer (L 1980, ch 866) or its history suggests an intention that the limited authority given to an Administrative Officer should work to impede the disciplinary process or inhibit the Commissioner and the Board of Regents from effectively and expeditiously resolving complaints of misconduct in the medical profession. Given the broad powers conferred upon the Commissioner in matters concerning the public health, and more particularly in regulating professional medical conduct, it would be anomalous if the Commissioner, under the unusual facts of this case, did not have the power to make his independent determination of the issues.  The power to do so is essential to the exercise of the far-reaching powers expressly granted to the Commissioner by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>

Relief in the nature of prohibition is not available to petitioner physician in a proceeding to annul and vacate an order of the Commissioner of Health, which reversed evidentiary rulings of an Administrative Officer made at a disciplinary hearing before a Committee of the State Board for Professional Medical Conduct. Although petitioner urges that the Commissioner's determination gives rise to an issue of constitutional dimension, it does not follow that this proceeding is properly brought as a legitimate exception to the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. Petitioner's challenge is directed only to the alleged evidentiary error committed within the disciplinary proceeding; the writ of prohibition does not lie as a means of seeking collateral review of a mere error of law in the administrative process, no matter how egregious that error might be, and however cleverly the error may be characterized by counsel as an excess of jurisdiction or power.  Petitioner has an adequate remedy in his right to institute a CPLR article 78 proceeding following a final agency determination. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The People appealed orders from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which granted defendant thief's motion to suppress physical evidence following an arrest for loitering and reversed defendant drug addict's conviction of loitering, in actions where defendants asserted that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(7) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were arrested for loitering in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(7). The People asserted that N.Y.

Defendants asserted that the statute was void for vagueness and violated constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizures and self-incrimination. The court held the statute was unconstitutionally vague, since it provided no legislative guidelines governing the determination as to whether a person was engaged in suspicious loitering in places of unrestricted public access. Also, since the facilities at issue here were &quot;public places,&quot; N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.35(7), as applied, did not satisfy due process, since it failed to give unequivocal notice to the unwary that an activity as innocuous as mere loitering was prohibited. Who would be stopped, questioned, and arrested under the statute was left solely up to the discretion of the police officer on the scene.

Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (7), which provides that &quot;[a] person is guilty of loitering when he * * * [loiters] or remains in any transportation facility, or is found sleeping therein, and is unable to give a satisfactory explanation of his presence&quot;, is unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions because it fails to give fair notice to the ordinary citizen that the prohibited conduct is illegal, it lacks minimal legislative guidelines, thereby permitting arbitrary enforcement and, finally, it requires that a citizen relinquish his constitutional right against compulsory self-incrimination in order to avoid arrest. Accordingly, in separate prosecutions of two defendants who were charged with loitering (Penal Law &sect; 240.35 [7]) in Pennsylvania Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, respectively, orders of the Appellate Division and Appellate Term which held that section 240.35 (7) was unconstitutionally vague, are affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The provision of Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (7), which requires a person suspected of violating the loitering statute to provide a &quot;satisfactory explanation&quot; of his presence to avoid arrest, is violative of a citizen's constitutional right not to answer questions posed by law enforcement officers (US Const 5th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 6).  A provision such as this one effectively deprives the citizen of his constitutional right to remain silent, since his failure to speak will result in certain arrest under the statute.  It punishes a suspect for exercising his constitutional right to remain silent and impermissibly transforms the invocation of this right into a criminal act.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Penal Law &sect; 240.35 (7), which prohibits loitering &quot;in any transportation facility&quot;, is unconstitutional as applied to defendants, who, in separate prosecutions, were charged with loitering in Pennsylvania Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal, respectively.  Under Penal Law &sect; 240.00 (2), a &quot;transportation facility&quot; is defined in such a broad, all-encompassing manner so as to include some facilities that are more analogous to the public street than to a specific area of restricted public access that gives notice of its prohibition against loitering. The statutory definition that embraces &quot;all appurtenances thereto&quot; is also too vague and wide ranging in the context of this case.  Since both transportation facilities at issue here are, in reality, &quot;public places&quot;, the statute, as applied, does not satisfy due process, since it fails to give unequivocal notice to the unwary that an activity as innocuous as mere loitering is prohibited.  Indeed, facilities such as Pennsylvania Station and Port Authority Bus Terminal are so public in nature, that they actually invite conduct that could be construed as loitering. Thus, in these two cases, the statute has the effect of prohibiting loitering in a public place and cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant natural gas company challenged on constitutional grounds the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed that N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 66-d requiring shared use of natural gas pipelines and respondent Public Service Commission's opinion were valid exercises of the state's police power and did not violate the United States Constitution or the New York Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 66-d (2) gave the Public Service Commission (PSC) the authority to order, after notice and hearing, any natural gas producer to transport or contract with others to transport gas under contract for sale, provided that the gas company had available capacity for such transport and such transport did not impair the gas company's ability to render adequate service to its customers. The law permitted an affected gas company to charge for the service it was ordered to provide. The natural gas company was ordered by the PSC to provide access to its gas lines. The natural gas company challenged the order, which was affirmed at the trial and appellate levels. On appeal, the court affirmed because &sect; 66-d (2) did not substantially interfere with the natural gas company's right to conduct its business or cause it to engage in business for which it had no authorization. It also held that &sect; 66-d (2) did not result in a taking without just compensation when it forced the natural gas company, within specified circumstances, to transport other companies' gas through its pipelines. The law and the order of the PSC were valid exercises of the state's police powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed because the law did not require the natural gas company to engage in acts for which it was not licensed, nor did it result in an illegal taking of the company's property when it mandated that other suppliers use the pipelines for transportation of their gas supplies to customers within the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Public Service Law &sect; 66-d (2) (as applied to plaintiff utility by Public Service Commission Opinion No. 85-6), which authorizes defendant Public Service Commission (PSC) to require certain utilities to transport customer-owned natural gas through their pipelines if the utility has excess capacity, receives reasonable compensation for doing so and if transportation of the customer-owned gas will not burden the utility or its ratepayers or impair the over-all quality of service to customers, does not substantially interfere with plaintiff's right to conduct its business, in violation of plaintiff's substantive due process rights.  Inasmuch as plaintiff is a public utility, it is under an obligation to discharge duties which affect the community at large and the Legislature may amend such duties in furtherance of the public interest. Public Service Law &sect; 66-d (2) does no more than compel the utility to provide access to its pipelines to New York State gas producers on occasions when it will not be burdensome to the utility or its remaining customers and upon payment of reasonable compensation. It is a reasonable regulation consistent with the public interest in developing the State's resources, furthering competition and controlling the cost of natural gas in the retail market.  Accordingly, the Legislature acted well within constitutional limitations when it modified the manner in which plaintiff was required to satisfy its public obligations declaring that the public must be afforded reasonable access to the utility's pipeline network in the manner specified.</SPAN></P>

Inasmuch as even private corporations may be deemed affected with a public interest and subjected to reasonable regulation under the State's police power, plaintiff's status as public or private carrier is largely irrelevant under modern substantive due process rules.  The dispositive question is whether the governmental exercise of its police powers is reasonable, and section 66-d (2) is a reasonable regulation consistent with the public interest in developing the State's resources, furthering competition and controlling the cost of natural gas in the retail market.  Plaintiff is a public utility affected with a public interest and, thus, under either old or current notions of substantive due process public duties manifestly can be imposed on it.</SPAN></P>

The statute appears to have little economic impact on plaintiff.  Nor does it appear that the State's action had any adverse affect on plaintiff's investment-backed expectations.  Further, the government's action involves only minimal, intermittent access to plaintiff's pipelines, under circumstances which will not interfere with plaintiff's regular business.  No permanent appropriation of plaintiff's property rights is involved.</SPAN></P>

The Legislature has defined the powers of corporations and it can redefine them by statutory amendment to promote the public interest.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. There is nothing in plaintiff utility's franchises which inhibits defendant Public Service Commission (PSC) from implementing Public Service Law &sect; 66-d (2) (as applied to plaintiff by PSC Opinion No. 85-6), which authorize the PSC to require certain utilities to transport customer-owned natural gas through their pipelines if the utility has excess capacity, receives reasonable compensation for doing so and if transportation of the customer-owned gas will not burden the utility or its ratepayers or impair the over-all quality of service to customers. Whether plaintiff's franchises specify that the gas it is to transport is to be owned by the franchisee or not, their terms may not be used to limit the State's lawful exercise of its police powers.  The franchises are no more than commitments by various local governments to plaintiff to use public property in exchange for supplying a public service and the State may revoke or modify them to impose new service obligations on the franchisee to promote the public good.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff builder appealed from a judgment of Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) that affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff's petition for review of an administrative decision, which partially revoked plaintiff's building permit, against defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff builder sought a permit to construct a new building near an area where the height of buildings was limited. When the building permit was issued, the issuer erroneously interpreted the map, finding plaintiff's location to fall outside the restricted area when in fact it was located within the restricted area. The Board of Standards and Appeals upheld the later partial revocation of plaintiff's building permit, and plaintiff sought judicial review. The trial court dismissed the petition, and the appellate court affirmed. Plaintiff appealed, and the court affirmed. There was no discretion to issue a building permit that failed to conform with applicable provisions of the law, and it was permissible to revoke a permit that had been issued in error when the conditions were such that the permit should not have been issued. Further, estoppel could not be invoked against a municipal agency to prevent it from discharging its statutory duties, including the enforcement of zoning laws.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Insofar as estoppel is not available to preclude a municipality from enforcing the provisions of its zoning laws and the mistaken or erroneous issuance of a permit does not estop a municipality from correcting errors, even where there are harsh results, respondent City of New York should not be estopped from revoking that portion of the original building permit issued to petitioner which violated the long-standing zoning limits imposed by the applicable Special Park Improvement District (P.I.D.) resolution with respect to the height of new buildings in that district, notwithstanding that petitioner's building has already been constructed in excess of the P.I.D. resolution's height limitations in reliance on the original permit.  Even if there was municipal error in one zoning map and in the mistaken administrative issuance of the original permit, those factors would be completely outweighed in this case by the doctrine that reasonable diligence would have readily uncovered for a good-faith inquirer the existence of the unequivocal limitations of 150 feet in the original binding metes and bounds description of the enabling legislation, and that this boundary has never been changed by the Board of Estimate; thus, the rare exception to the unavailability of estoppel against governmental entities may not be invoked in this case.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- New York City Zoning Resolution -- Partial Revocation of Erroneously Issued Building Permit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The New York City Department of Buildings has no discretion to issue a building permit which fails to conform with applicable provisions of law and the Commissioner of Buildings may revoke a permit which &quot;has been issued in error and conditions are such that a permit should not have been issued&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect;&sect; 27-191, 27-197).  Further, discrepancies between the zoning map and the enabling resolution are controlled by the specifics of the resolution (New York City Zoning Resolution &sect;&sect; 11-22, 12-01).  Accordingly, the original building permit issued to petitioner was invalid where it authorized construction within the 150-foot Special Park Improvement District (P.I.D.) above 19 stories in violation of New York City Zoning Resolution &sect; 92-06 and, therefore, the subsequent action of the Board of Standards and Appeals, in ratifying the decision of the Commissioner of Buildings partially revoking petitioner's permit to the extent that it authorized construction to a height of 31 stories within the 150-foot P.I.D., had a sound legal basis.</SPAN></P>

In a proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78, arising from respondent City of New York's partial revocation of a building permit erroneously issued to petitioner, pursuant to which petitioner had already constructed a building in excess of the height limitations of applicable zoning provisions, petitioner's claim that the City's action constitutes a taking without due process of law or just compensation may not be addressed by the Court of Appeals on petitioner's appeal from the Appellate Division's affirmance of the dismissal of the petition because petitioner had failed to apply for a variance. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the provisions of the Code, unpaid property taxes became a lien against each property that could be purchased with only notice by publication. Nassau County, N.Y. Admin. Code &sect; 5-37.0(a),(c). The purchasers served a notice to redeem to the record owner and if he or she failed to redeem, the purchaser took title. The former property owners contended that they were denied due process because they had not received actual notice of the tax lien sales, they had been denied any hearing before conveyance of the property, and that the notice they did receive was inadequate to inform them of the situation. The court held that due process required a balancing of the State's interests and the individual's interest in actually being informed of proceedings affecting rights or property. Because the interests of the former property owners was substantially affected by an act of government, and because the owner's name and address were known, due process required that actual notice be given. Further, N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 1002(4), 1014(3), 2006, required personal service upon the property owner of both the notice of sale of the tax lien and the notice to redeem.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Where the interest of a property owner will be substantially affected by an act of government, and where the owner's name and address are known, due process requires that actual notice be given.  Accordingly, the failure of the former real estate tax collection enforcement provisions of the Nassau County Administrative Code to provide for actual notice to the property owner of a tax lien sale in that statutory scheme, constitutes a deprivation of due process and, therefore, those former provisions are unconstitutional.  The Nassau County tax lien sale commences enforcement proceedings that may terminate 24 months later in forfeiture upon the mere request of the tax lien purchaser, without any requirement or opportunity for a hearing or any court intervention.  The tax lien sale is a condition precedent to the transfer of title.  Moreover, substantial interest, penalties and expenses accrue upon that sale.  Thus, the tax lien sale, in the context of this Code, creates &quot;momentous consequences&quot; for the homeowner and -- balanced against these consequences -- requiring that a notice be mailed to a person whose name and address are known imposes a minimal burden on the County.  Actual notice is therefore required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Former Real Estate Tax Collection Enforcement Provisions of Nassau County Administrative Code -- Due Process of Law -- No Actual Notice of Tax Lien Sale -- Actual Notice of Notice to Redeem</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The failure of the former real estate tax collection enforcement provisions of the Nassau County Administrative Code to provide property owners with actual notice of tax lien sales constitutes a deprivation of due process and, therefore, those provisions are unconstitutional.  Further, the Nassau County statutory scheme cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny because the Code requires mailing of the notice to redeem to the property owner three months before the deed is conveyed to the purchaser of the tax lien. What is reasonable for purposes of notice is usually a legislative policy determination; however, whether legislative choice passes constitutional muster is a decision for the courts.  The mechanism designed by the Nassau County legislators to provide what they deemed was adequate notice to property owners contemplated that before automatic forfeiture, there would be a 24-month redemption period.  It is their failure to provide due process notice of the tax lien sale that has shrunk that period to a mere three months and defeated the legislative intention.  Moreover, notice which does not afford a realistic opportunity to produce the funds necessary to avoid forfeiture of the title or sell the encumbered property does not afford due process.  The truncated three-month period would in any event be troubling as satisfying the due process notice requirement, particularly where very large surpluses are at stake.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Inasmuch as the Court of Appeals declaration that the former real estate tax collection enforcement provisions of the Nassau County Administrative Code are unconstitutional could have broad, unsettling effect on the marketability of otherwise settled titles to property, the court's decision is to have no general retroactive application and shall apply only to cases where tax titles are still in the normal litigating process.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the New York State Department of Transportation (department), sought review of a judgment of the Supreme Court of New York, which granted respondent employee's petition in his action under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 that challenged the department's determination to discharge the employee after he had refused to answer questions in his capacity as a supervisory employee in the department's investigation of wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee filed suit, asserting that his discharge violated his constitutionally guaranteed right against self-incrimination because he was not informed by the department at the investigatory proceeding under N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 61 that he was entitled by operation of law to immunity from the use of his answers in any subsequent criminal prosecution. The court found that the department did not have the power either to confer the immunity or to define or alter its breadth. The employee was assisted and advised by counsel that was present throughout the hearing, a situation that did not implicate the danger faced by witnesses testifying before a grand jury. Insofar as the employee was not requested to waive his right to immunity before answering questions specifically, directly, and narrowly relating to his official duties, his dismissal did not violate fundamental fairness or his privilege against self-incrimination. Moreover, there was substantial evidence to support the department's determination that the employee willfully refused to answer the questions posed, and dismissal was not so disproportionate as to be shocking to one's sense of fairness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When a public employee is compelled to answer questions or face removal upon refusing to do so, the responses are cloaked with immunity automatically, and neither the compelled statements nor their fruits may thereafter be used against the employee in a subsequent criminal prosecution. However, the State may compel any person enjoying a public trust to account for his activities and may terminate his services if he refuses to answer relevant questions, or furnishes information indicating that he is no longer entitled to public confidence.  What is proscribed as unconstitutional is to condition public employment upon a waiver of the privilege against self-incrimination. Thus, insofar as petitioner, a supervisory employee with the Department of Transportation, was not requested to waive his right to immunity before answering questions specifically, directly and narrowly relating to his official duties in a civil proceeding instituted pursuant to Public Officers Law &sect; 61 to investigate disciplinary charges of work-related misconduct, petitioner's dismissal for refusing to answer those questions did not violate fundamental fairness or his privilege against self-incrimination despite the State's failure to inform him that immunity automatically attached by operation of law before ordering him to answer the questions.  As the Commissioner's representative at the investigatory proceeding did not have the power to confer immunity, or to modify the immunity to which petitioner was entitled, there is no basis for concluding that he nonetheless had an affirmative obligation to inform petitioner of the automatic attachment of immunity.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is substantial evidence in the record to support the determination of the respondent Commissioner of the Department of Transportation that petitioner, a supervisory employee with 34 years of service in the Department's Waterways Division, willfully refused to answer questions directly relating to the performance of his official duties at a civil proceeding instituted pursuant to Public Officers Law &sect; 61 to investigate disciplinary charges of work-related misconduct, and dismissal under the circumstances is not so disproportionate to the offense as to be shocking to one's sense of fairness. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Commissioner of the State Department of Health, the Public Health Council (Council), and Council employees, challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a trial court's order finding that the smoking policies adopted by the Council were invalid and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Council promulgated a comprehensive code to govern tobacco smoking in areas open to the public. The Legislature gave the Council broad authority to promulgate regulations on matters concerning the public health pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 225(5)(a). Appellees, affected businesses, groups, and individuals, asked for declaratory relief, and the trial court granted summary judgment, which was affirmed by the appellate division. The court affirmed the decisions of the lower courts. The broad grant of authority did not contravene the principle that the legislative branch of government cannot cede its fundamental policy-making responsibility to an administrative agency. The Council exceeded the permissible scope of its mandate by using it as a basis for engaging in inherently legislative activities. Enactments conferring authority on administrative agencies in broad or general terms must be interpreted in light of the limitations that the Constitution imposes (N.Y. Const. art. III, &sect; 1). Striking the proper balance among health concerns, cost, and privacy interests was a uniquely legislative function.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- No-Smoking Regulations -- Separation of Powers</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Public Health Council (PHC) overstepped the boundaries of its lawfully delegated authority, running afoul of the constitutional separation of powers doctrine, when it promulgated a comprehensive code to govern tobacco smoking in areas that are open to the public (10 NYCRR part 25).  While the Legislature has given the PHC broad authority to promulgate regulations on matters concerning the public health, the scope of the PHC's authority under its enabling statute (Public Health Law &sect; 225 [5] [a]) must be deemed limited by its role as an administrative, rather than a legislative, body.  The PHC usurped the latter role and thereby exceeded its legislative mandate, when, following the Legislature's inability to reach an acceptable balance, the Council weighed the concerns of nonsmokers, smokers, affected businesses and the general public and, without any legislative guidance, reached its own conclusions about the proper accommodation among those competing interests.  In view of the political, social and economic, rather than technical, focus of the resulting regulatory scheme, the PHC's actions were ultra vires.  Further, the &quot;separability&quot; provision of the PHC's rules (10 NYCRR 25.7) cannot be used to save those rules from the conclusion that, taken as a whole, they are invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Validity of Regulation -- No-Smoking Regulations -- Preemption of Field by State Legislature</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. By enacting Public Health Law article 13-E, which imposes restrictions on smoking in a narrow class of public locations, the Legislature did not preempt the field of indoor smoking so as to preclude the Public Health Council's (PHC) promulgation of regulations prohibiting smoking in a wide variety of indoor areas that are open to the public (10 NYCRR part 25).  The Legislature has given the PHC a wide field for the exercise of its regulatory authority (Public Health Law &sect; 225 [5] [a]), and nothing in the Legislature's 1975 adoption of a limited antismoking provision (Public Health Law art 13-E) suggests a legislative intention to narrow the statutory mandate or exclude the area of smoking restrictions.  Although the PHC's regulations prohibit smoking in a wider variety of indoor settings than do the Legislature's enactments on the subject, both the regulations and the relevant statutes have a common underlying policy objective -- minimizing nonsmokers' exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real estate developer argued that, because the law allowed a tax exemption at the time he purchased the property, a subsequent change deprived it of due process because it acted in reliance on the inducement contained in the law at the time of its purchase.

The court rejected the real estate developer's argument and noted that retroactivity provisions in tax statutes were valid especially when the retroactivity extended for only a short period. The court noted that the real estate developer had been forewarned of a change in the legislation, and thus, its reliance on the old law was unreasonable. The real estate developer also conceded that the length of the legislation's retroactivity was valid. The court also found that the legislation had a valid public purpose.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Petitioner, who commenced renovation of two single room occupancy (SRO) buildings in April 1983 was not unconstitutionally deprived of due process by the retroactive application of the amended version of Real Property Tax Law &sect; 489 (L 1983, ch 401, eff June 30, 1983, retroactive to June 1, 1982) to prevent petitioner from qualifying for the receipt of the tax exemption for the renovation of SRO buildings provided by Administrative Code of the City of New York former &sect; J51-2.5 pursuant to the enabling legislation of Real Property Tax Law former &sect; 489, which expired on June 1, 1982.  The one-year period of retroactivity is not excessive, and the objectives of the retroactive application -- to forestall the loss of SRO housing and to discourage the precipitous eviction of tenants -- are valid public purposes.  More importantly, petitioner was forewarned that the State authorization for the exemption expired on June 1, 1982 thereby calling into question the continued validity of the Administrative Code provision after that date.  Accordingly, petitioner may not now claim he entertained a settled reasonable expectation of entitlement to the City's exemption based upon renovations he did not commence until April 1983 and, since he could not have justifiably relied on the tax inducement as it existed in 1982, application of this particular retroactive provision to petitioner did not constitute an unconstitutional deprivation of due process.  </SPAN></P>

Accordingly, since DHCR was acting in a governmental and not proprietary capacity in exercising its regulatory powers over respondent, and since estoppel generally may not be invoked against a municipal agency to prevent it from discharging its statutory duties, the factual setting in this case does not warrant an exception to that doctrine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Commissioner of Health of the State of New York (commissioner) filed an action against petitioner nursing home owners. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) affirmed a judgment of the lower court permanently enjoining the commissioner from revoking the nursing home owners' operating certificate as a result of their 1979 industry-related felony convictions. The commissioner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner contended that the administrative proceedings initiated against the nursing home owners were not barred under the doctrine of res judicata. The commissioner also contended that neither the prior final judgments nor the operating certificates themselves conferred on the nursing home owners constitutionally protected rights, which would have been impaired by the application to them of N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2806(5), as amended. The court stated that the vested rights doctrine did not preclude application of &sect; 2806(5) to the nursing home owners. The court found that there was a strong public interest to be served by permitting &sect; 2806(5) to be enforced as amended in 1983 and that the public interest overrode the nursing home owners' claimed constitutional objection. The court concluded that a second revocation proceeding was not unfair to nursing home owners in any sense that was protected by law because the proceeding was, to the contrary, supported by supervening considerations of public interest that have been properly balanced by the legislature.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The doctrine of vested rights does not foreclose a second administrative proceeding pursuant to Public Health Law &sect; 2806 (5), as amended in 1983 (L 1983, ch 584), for automatic revocation of petitioners' nursing home operating certificate owing to their industry-related felony convictions where the final judgment in the first revocation proceeding denied automatic revocation because the then applicable law (Public Health Law &sect; 2806 [5], as amended by L 1981, ch 607) was impermissibly at odds with Correction Law &sect; 701.  The 1983 amendments to section 2806 (5) -- explicitly made retroactive by the Legislature -- were intended to apply to all licensed operators, even those like petitioners who had litigated the automatic revocation issue to a final judgment in their favor under preexisting law. The doctrine of vested rights, pursuant to which a judgment becomes an inviolable property right once all avenues of appeal have been exhausted which thereafter may not constitutionally be abridged by subsequent legislation, is, however, conclusory, and a fiction that hides many unmentioned considerations of fairness to the parties, reliance on preexisting law, the extent of retroactivity and the nature of the public interest to be served by the law.  Balancing the various factors upon which the constitutionality of retroactive legislation depends, the vested rights doctrine does not preclude application of the amended statute to these petitioners.  There is a strong public interest, that of policing the nursing home industry and removing persons convicted of industry-related felonies from the operation of nursing homes, to be served by permitting the law to be enforced as amended in 1983, and the public interest overrides petitioners' claimed constitutional objection.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The doctrine of res judicata does not foreclose a second administrative proceeding pursuant to Public Health Law &sect; 2806 (5), as amended in 1983 (L 1983, ch 584), for automatic revocation of petitioners' nursing home operating certificate owing to their industry-related felony convictions where the final judgment in the first revocation proceeding denied automatic revocation because the then applicable law (Public Health Law &sect; 2806 [5], as amended by L 1981, ch 607) was impermissibly at odds with Correction Law &sect; 701.  Although both revocation proceedings instituted against petitioners are based on the same felony convictions, seeking the same remedy, the statutory rights of the parties were altered between the first and second proceedings.  This being so, the two proceedings against petitioners can be said to lack the requisite identity for application of res judicata. For compelling reasons in the public interest, the Legislature provided that all persons holding operating certificates at the time of the amended law should be equally subject to automatic forfeiture upon conviction of an industry-related felony. If the pending proceeding against petitioners under the amended statute were precluded by res judicata, petitioners would be left with a license to operate a public health facility despite their convictions and despite the fact that others operating comparable facilities automatically lose their licenses upon comparable convictions.  A second revocation proceeding is not unfair to petitioners in any sense that is protected by law; this proceeding is, to the contrary, supported by supervening considerations of public interest that have been properly balanced by the Legislature.  </SPAN></P>

The judges contended that in view of the ADEA and the administrative board's interpretation thereof, the N.Y. Const. and N.Y. Jud. Law provisions denied them due process and equal protection.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. NY Constitution, article VI, &sect; 25 (b) and Judiciary Law &sect; 23, which require retirement of Judges and Justices of the Unified Court System at age 70, as applied to plaintiffs, various State Judges, do not deny them their constitutional right to equal protection of the laws because of the Administrative Board's interpretation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (29 USC &sect; 623), which prohibits discrimination in employment based on age, against persons age 70 and above, to require that appointed Judges be allowed to continue to the end of their appointive terms, notwithstanding their age, but that elected Judges must retire at age 70 because the Federal statute, by its terms, does not apply to elected State officers (29 USC &sect; 630 [f]).  Age is not a suspect class and therefore the appropriate standard of review is whether the classifications created are rationally related to some State interest.  Applying that standard, the Administrative Board did not err in applying the Federal statute as written, nor does any denial of plaintiffs' rights to equal protection of the laws result from the joint operation of the State and Federal statutes and the State constitutional provision. That the State policy requiring retirement of Judges is partially frustrated because the Federal statute preempts it with respect to appointed Judges does not render the policy irrational and the State is free to pursue that policy to the extent doing so is consistent with Federal law.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the local law was facially valid. The court concluded that the city had express authority to enact the local law under N.Y. Mun.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Local Laws, 1986, No. 63 of the City of New York (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; 11-208.1) which, with certain exceptions, requires owners of income-producing property in New York City to furnish income and expense statements to the Commissioner of Finance in preparation for real property assessment, is a valid exercise of the City's home rule power.  Municipal Home Rule Law &sect; 10 (1) (ii) (c) (2) supplies the express authority to enact Local Law No. 63 because the filing of the income and expense statements relates essentially to the &quot;preparation of assessments&quot;.  Inasmuch as Local Law No. 63, by its terms, requires the filing of information related solely to the operation of the income-producing property, it is neither an exercise of impermissible in personam taxing jurisdiction over individual property owners nor is it inconsistent with the so-called in rem nature of the real property tax as defined by the State Legislature </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, RPTL 304).  The filing requirement of this local law does not relieve a municipality, as an assessor, from its statutorily imposed nondelegable duty of determining the value of the property to be taxed, nor on its face does it unfairly or inappropriately shift the burden of doing so to the real property taxpayer.  Moreover, the City's enactment does not conflict with RPTL 1802 because RPTL article 18 deals exclusively with methods of assessment and Local Law No. 63 deals with preassessment valuation information.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.

The local ordinance is not inconsistent with the State Constitution on equal protection grounds.  While Local Law No. 63 distinguishes between taxpayers based on the size or value of the property, that does not per se render an enactment unconstitutional unless there is no rational basis for the classifications. The City advances several particular justifications for exempting and thus distinguishing smaller property owners from the filing requirements.  Further, Local Law No. 63 is not unconstitutionally vague.  Due process requires only a reasonable degree of certainty so that individuals of ordinary intelligence are not forced to guess at the meaning of statutory terms, and here that standard is satisfied because the disputed terms </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(e.g</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., &quot;income&quot;, &quot;expense&quot;, &quot;assessed value&quot; and &quot;current fiscal year&quot;) are defined by judicial construction or are commonly used in other statutes without further definition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff administrator commenced two malpractice actions against the state and against defendant state employees. A lower court dismissed plaintiff's complaint against defendants, holding that the state was the real party in interest in such an action. The court reversed the lower court's order and denied defendants' motion to dismiss. The court held that defendants were the real parties in interest, not the state, and that, therefore, the lower court had subject matter jurisdiction. The court determined that a suit against a state officer would be held to be one which was really asserted against the state when it arose from actions or determinations of the officer made in his or her official role and involved rights asserted not against the officer individually but solely against the state. The court found further that N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect;17 did not impose direct liability upon the state for the negligent acts or omissions of its employees or make the state the real party in interest in actions against them, and did not purport to diminish the remedies available to an injured party.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Jurisdiction -- Jurisdiction of Supreme Court to Entertain Negligence Action against State Employees -- Alleged Breach of Duty of Care Owed by State Employees Directly to Injured Party</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Where a suit against a State agent or officer is in tort for damages arising from the breach of a duty owed individually by such agent or officer directly to the injured party, the employees are the real parties in interest -- not the State, even though it could be held secondarily liable for the tortious acts under respondeat superior -- and, therefore, Supreme Court has subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, in a malpractice action commenced in Supreme Court against defendants, State-employed physicians, to recover damages allegedly resulting from defendants' negligent medical treatment of plaintiff's decedent, an order of the Appellate Division, which reversed Supreme Court's order denying defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction ( CPLR 3211 [a] [2]) and dismissed the complaint, is reversed and defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint is denied.  Plaintiff's suit against defendants individually for an alleged breach of the duty of care owed by them directly to decedent was not one against State officers as representatives of the State in their official capacity which had to be brought in the Court of Claims.  That plaintiff could have chosen to proceed in the Court of Claims directly against the State based on its vicarious responsibility for defendants' actions does not make the State the real party in interest in the suit against defendants in Supreme Court.  Nothing in Public Officers Law &sect; 17 (which provides for the defense and indemnification of State employees by the State for acts or omissions in the course of employment) imposes direct liability upon the State for the negligent acts or omissions of its employees or makes the State the real party in interest in actions against them; the statute does not purport to diminish the remedies available to an injured party. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prospective candidates filed designating petitions for nomination as the democratic candidate for the office of Surrogate. The petitions to validate and invalidate the designating petitions on various grounds were filed in the trial court. The prospective candidates raised a constitutional challenge to the 5,000-signature requirement of &sect; 6-136(2)(b), as being unduly burdensome in light of the shortened time period for collecting signatures following the recent removal of the sitting surrogate. The trial court held the provision constitutional and the appellate division reversed. The court reversed and held that the equal protection ground upon which the prospective candidates ultimately prevailed was first advanced at the lower court. Thus, there was no evidence that any notice was provided to the attorney-general that the differing signature requirements based upon geographic location were being challenged as unconstitutional and that that failure not only ignored fundamental principles of separation of powers, but also adversely affected the judicial review process which required a full presentation and record upon which constitutional determinations could be based.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A determination of invalidity of an enactment of the Legislature -- with ramifications beyond the parties and their immediate dispute -- necessarily must be founded upon an adequate record,  the parties having properly raised their contentions and presented their proof in the lower courts.  Also important to the procedure for challenging the constitutionality of a State statute is notification to the Attorney-General </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Executive Law &sect; 71; CPLR 1012), which ensures that all of the people of the State may be represented when the constitutionality of their laws is put in issue and serves the additional function of ensuring the development of an adequate record upon which the court may base its determination.  Accordingly, two orders of the Appellate Division, which declared Election Law &sect; 6-136 (2) (b)&nbsp;unconstitutional on the ground that the statute denied equal protection by requiring candidates for the same elective office in counties of substantially equivalent population to collect different numbers of signatures, are reversed.  The equal protection ground upon which candidates Backal and McGee ultimately prevailed was first advanced at the Appellate Division.  Further, there is no evidence that any notice was provided to the Attorney-General that the differing signature requirements based upon geographic location were being challenged as unconstitutional.  Thus,  the mechanism designed to afford a necessary opportunity to examine fully particular challenges to the constitutionality of statutes was not set in motion and not satisfied.  Such failure not only ignores fundamental principles of separation of powers, but also adversely affects the judicial review process which requires a full presentation and record upon which constitutional determinations must be based.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission appealed the judgment of the trial court, which annulled a determination of the commission sustaining a sales tax assessment on sales made at the department store's out-of-state stores to non-New York residents who directed the store to have the merchandise delivered by common carrier as gifts to New York residents. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court finding that the transactions were deemed to have occurred wholly outside New York State and that, consequently, the New York State sales tax was inapplicable. The sale required consideration pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 1101(b)(5) and that was given by the purchaser out-of-state. The recipients of the gifts within the state were wholly unconnected with the out-of-state exchange of consideration for transfer of title and possession to the purchaser. Therefore, the events at issue were comprised of two transactions: out-of-state sales, followed by gifts to New York residents.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A non-New York resident's out-of-State purchase of a gift from a store owned by petitioner, which also does business in New York, is not subject to New York State sales tax (Tax Law &sect; 1105 [a]) solely because, at the customer's request, petitioner arranges to have the gift delivered by common carrier to the ultimate intended recipient in New York.  In such circumstances, the transaction must be deemed to have occurred wholly outside New York State and, consequently, the New York State sales tax is inapplicable.  The act of delivering a gift to a New York resident by a common carrier engaged by petitioner does not constitute a transfer of possession within New York under Tax Law &sect; 1101 (b) (5), subjecting the transaction to sales tax. Although delivery in New York has often been listed as a major factor indicating that a taxable New York sale has occurred, it is only that delivery which transfers control of the merchandise for consideration which marks a taxable event. The transactions in this case are not taxable as the purchasers' only control over the property was exercised out of State when they directed petitioner to send the merchandise to New York donees after the sale was completed.  Most importantly, it cannot be ignored that the only New York nexus to these transactions is the location of the passive recipients of gifts. Since the recipients of the gifts within New York were wholly unconnected with the out-of-State exchange of consideration for transfer of title and possession to the purchaser, the events at issue were comprised of two transactions: out-of-State sales, followed by gifts to New York donees. Neither transaction justifies imposition of New York's sales tax. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, affordable housing associations, sought review of an order entered in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), that affirmed a judgment that declared defendant town's zoning ordinance was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that housing associations essentially sought judicial rezoning through their action and declined to perform this legislative function. The court affirmed the lower courts' conclusion that associations failed to overcome the presumption of constitutionality of the town's zoning ordinance. The court noted that associations had not demonstrated that the town's efforts caused a shortage of shelter. Additionally findings showed that the inadequate development of low-cost multi-family housing stemmed from a lack of developers, rather than from the town's regulations.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action by plaintiffs seeking a judgment, among other things, declaring the zoning ordinance of the Town of Brookhaven void in its entirety because of the Town's failure to exercise its zoning power (Town Law &sect; 261) to enable development of sufficient low-cost shelter and ordering the Town to take affirmative action to rectify the perceived housing shortage, an order of the Appellate Division which affirmed a Supreme Court judgment holding that the Town properly exercised its land use authority and concluding that plaintiffs had failed to overcome the presumption of the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance, is affirmed.  There are affirmed factual findings by the courts below, for which there is support in the record, that numerous developer applications for multifamily and subsidized housing were approved despite the special permit procedures contained in the ordinance for such housing. Moreover, there are affirmed findings that a significant reason for inadequate development of low-cost, multifamily housing was not the chilling effect of the application procedures but the lack of developers willing to undertake such projects due to factors such as rising construction and financing costs and economic stagnation. Thus, plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that efforts by the Town caused the claimed shortage of shelter. Further, in view of the affirmed factual findings, the Court of Appeals declines to take the legislative action urged by plaintiffs of rezoning 49,100 acres of vacant residential land and an unspecified number of parcels. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district appealed from an order of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which unanimously affirmed an order and judgment that granted a petition prohibiting the enforcement of a school district policy that required all probationary teachers who were eligible for appointment on tenure to submit to a urine test for the purpose of detecting potential drug abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district notified all probationary teachers by letter that they must submit to a urinalysis examination. There was no resolution by the Board of Education requiring these tests and there is no policy statement or directive from either the Board or the Superintendent relating to them. However, the teachers were informed that the Superintendent would not recommend for tenure any teacher who refused to provide the urine sample. Prior to the scheduled examination, petitioner teachers' union sought to prohibit the test, claiming that it was unauthorized and constituted an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the teachers' constitutional rights. The court concluded that the test did not satisfy the requirements of either the state or federal Constitutions and that the government's act of requiring a person to submit to urinalysis for drug abuse constituted a search and seizure. The court agreed that probable cause and a warrant were not required before school officials could demand that a teacher submit to a urinalysis for potential drug abuse, but held that appellant did not meet the standard of an articulated reasonable suspicion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Teachers -- Constitutionality of School District Policy Requiring All Probationary Teachers to Submit to Urine Test to Detect Potential Drug Abuse -- Reasonable Expectation of Privacy -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Reasonable Suspicion Standard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A urine test to detect potential drug abuse, which respondent School District requires all probationary teachers to submit to, does not satisfy the requirements of either the State or Federal Constitutions for conducting a lawful search and seizure. A urine test compelled by a government employer to determine illegal drug use infringes on the individual's reasonable expectation of privacy, and the government's act of requiring a person to submit to urinalysis for the purpose of detecting potential drug abuse constitutes a search and seizure. Since teachers have a diminished expectation of privacy with respect to State inquiries into their physical fitness to perform as teachers, it is not unreasonable for school authorities to require a teacher to submit to urinalysis for the purpose of detecting potential drug abuse without a warrant on grounds less than probable cause, but school officials must meet a standard of reasonable suspicion before they can demand that a teacher submit to such a test.  Accordingly, since respondent School District concededly did not have reasonable suspicion to believe that all or any of its probationary teachers was engaged in drug abuse, the urine tests ordered by the School District violate the guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures found in both the State and Federal Constitutions (US Const 4th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 12).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Urine Test</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Compelled by Government Employer to Determine Illegal Drug Use -- Reasonable Expectation of Privacy with Respect to Urine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A urine test compelled by a government employer to determine illegal drug use infringes on the individual's reasonable expectation of privacy. A person has a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to urine notwithstanding that it is a waste product periodically eliminated from the body.  Although it is a waste product, urine is not generally eliminated in public or in such a way that the public or government officials can gain access to it in order to &quot;read&quot; its contents.  A person can have no reasonable expectation of privacy in things which are intentionally abandoned or discarded, but it does not follow from this rule that a person has no privacy interests in a waste product before it is abandoned and therefore no right to dispose of it in a way which maintains privacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Searches and Seizures -- What Constitutes Search and Seizure -- Government's Act of Requiring Person to Submit to Urinalysis to Detect Potential Drug Abuse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The government's act of requiring a person to submit to urinalysis for the purpose of detecting potential drug abuse constitutes a search and seizure, notwithstanding that urine may be obtained without invading the body.  The act of discharging urine is a private, indeed intimate, one and the product may contain revealing information concerning an individual's personal life and habits for those capable of analyzing it.  Ordering a person to empty his or her bladder and produce the urine in a container for inspection and analysis by public officials is no less offensive to personal dignity than requiring an individual to empty his pockets and produce a report containing the results of a urinalysis examination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Teachers -- Reasonable Suspicion as Standard for Compelling Teachers to Submit to Urinalysis to Detect Potential Drug Abuse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Under special circumstances, it may be reasonable to permit the government to conduct a search without a warrant on grounds not amounting to probable cause. In such instances, the court must assess the reasons for the search and the extent to which it intrudes on legitimate privacy interests to determine whether, on balance, the government's action is reasonable.  Inasmuch as the School District has an interest in seeing that its teachers are fit and that drug use does not impair their ability to deal with the students, and teachers in New York are generally required to submit to an examination to determine their physical and mental fitness to perform their duties (Education Law &sect; 913), teachers therefore have a diminished expectation of privacy with respect to State inquiries into their physical fitness to perform as teachers, and it is not unreasonable to require teachers to submit to further testing when school authorities have reason to suspect that they are currently unfit for teaching duties.  Accordingly, when school authorities seek to have teachers submit to urinalysis for potential drug abuse, reasonable suspicion is an appropriate standard, and probable cause and a warrant are not required.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Searches and Seizures -- Random Search Conducted without Reasonable Suspicion -- Requirements -- School District Not Permitted to Require All Probationary Teachers to Submit to Urinalysis to Detect Potential Drug Abuse</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Random searches conducted by the State without reasonable suspicion are closely scrutinized, and generally only permitted when the privacy interests implicated are minimal, the government's interest is substantial, and safeguards are provided to insure that the individual's reasonable expectation of privacy is not subjected to unregulated discretion.  Thus, where respondent School District did not have reasonable suspicion to believe that all or any of its probationary teachers was engaged in drug abuse, the School District is not permitted to require all probationary teachers to submit to urinalysis to detect potential drug abuse. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which reversed, on the law, an order of the county court denying respondent's motion under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10 to vacate the judgment convicting him of burglary, criminal trespass, and petit larceny, and which remitted the case for review of the prosecution's motion on the merits and for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary, criminal trespass, and petit larceny. He collaterally attacked the judgment by bringing a motion to vacate, pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10(1)(h), alleging ineffective assistance of counsel due to appellate counsel's failure to raise questions as to prosecutorial misconduct or to challenge the verdict. Defendant subsequently challenged the order of the appellate court. On appeal, the court noted that there was a need to find a procedural forum in which to address claims of ineffective assistance of counsel which allegedly occurred in the intermediate court. N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 440.10 was not an available or appropriate procedural avenue to challenge the foundation judgment of conviction based on such a ground. The court held that since state criminal procedural law did not anticipate and provide a remedy for this particular situation, the remedy lay in the intermediate appellate court itself, by the invocation and determination there of the traditional writ of error coram nobis. The court also stressed the need for legislative action on this issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the appellate court was reversed and the case was remitted to said court because a common law coram nobis proceeding brought in the proper appellate court was the only available and appropriate procedure and forum to review such a claim until there was a legislative remedy.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Counsel -- Effective Representation -- Claim of Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel in Intermediate Appellate Court Reviewable by Writ of Error Coram Nobis in Intermediate Appellate Court Itself</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Inasmuch as the Criminal Procedure Law failed to anticipate and to provide a procedure and forum in which to address claims of ineffective assistance of counsel allegedly occurring in the intermediate appellate court, the remedy lies in the intermediate appellate court itself by the invocation and determination there of the traditional writ of error coram nobis. A motion to vacate judgment under CPL 440.10 (1) (h) does not include the claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and to force the fit would constitute legislation by judicial fiat.  Likewise, a motion for reargument ( CPL 470.50) is not an acceptable solution since a motion for reargument is not an appropriate vehicle for raising new questions which were not previously advanced; further, the lack of uniformity and the relative shortness of time among the State's various appellate tribunals for making reargument motions would lead to disparate treatment of persons seeking review of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claims; nor is reargument traditionally perceived as providing the fresh, clean examination which should be given to alleged deprivations of counsel.  Thus, until such time as a proper statutory remedy is enacted, an appellant is entitled to bring a motion for a writ of error coram nobis, on the ground of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, in the appellate tribunal which considered the primary appeal in which counsel was allegedly deficient. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city brought suit to enjoin appellee business from installing metal bins on city sidewalks to distribute advertisements. The trial court dismissed the city's actions as violative of the First Amendment and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed that judgment. The city appealed from those rulings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business installed on city sidewalks metal bins to distribute its publications. The publications included some articles, but were mainly advertisements for non-accredited classes offered by the business. Other publications were permitted to set up similar bins but those bins, unlike the business's bins, were coin-operated. The city had no regulation governing the placement of these bins. The city sought to remove the bins placed by the business because they were depleted of their contents and filled with trash. The trial court recognized that the business's pamphlets were merely disguised advertising, but held that in the absence of a narrowly regulation governing the installation of the bins, the city's action was unconstitutional. The appellate court affirmed. The court also affirmed and held that (1) while the city was permitted to regulate the installation of bins, it had to do so by properly drawn regulations balancing the city's right to maintain health and safety with First Amendment speech and press freedoms; (2) the First Amendment protected distribution of a newspaper as well as its content; and (3) the city's action was not based on regulation and was arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Freedom of Press -- Distribution of Magazine via Bins Installed on New York City Streets in Absence of Local Ordinance or Regulation Governing Use of Bins</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It would be a violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution to allow the City of New York, in the absence of local ordinance or regulation, to invoke judicial enforcement of its efforts to clear the City's sidewalks of defendants' bins installed for distribution of a free publication, whether the publication is categorized as commercial or non-commercial speech.  A government official or employee may not exercise complete and unregulated discretion, in the absence of duly enacted guidelines or procedures, to decide which publications may be distributed via bins on City streets. The City may regulate the installation of bins on its sidewalks, but it must do so by properly drawn regulations synchronizing the City's right to maintain health and safety with First Amendment speech and press freedoms.  In order to exert its police power and to restrict access to a public forum, a municipality must adopt reasonable regulations governing the time, place and manner of expression. The regulations must be content neutral, sensitively calibrated to the governmental interest at stake, and must also leave open alternative channels of communication.  They must be publicly promulgated upon being duly enacted. In this case, the City's action against defendants was taken without the benefit of any regulation. The decision to deny defendants use of bins for distribution was made presumably on the private criteria of a subordinate attorney of the City Law Department. The City Council is the proper legislative body of the City of New York in this substantive area and the Board of Estimate holds the exclusive implementing authority with respect to the use of City property.  For the City to have acted with such arbitrary discretion vested in some governmental authority is inherently inconsistent with a valid time, placeand manner regulation. Thus, the City of New York is not entitled to judicial relief against defendants' form of distribution of its publication.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action for a judgment declaring CCA 110 (f)&nbsp;unconstitutional as violative of the doctrine of separation of powers since it provides for the appointment of Housing Judges by the Chief Administrative Judge, wherein defendants contended that the statute was constitutional since Housing Judges were not full-fledged Judges, an order of the Appellate Division, which affirmed a judgment granting summary judgment to defendants and declaring the statute constitutional, is affirmed.

While the Court of Appeals, and the entire appellate function, are better served when the regular review process is followed, including some articulation of the reasoning the intermediate appellate court chose to adopt when it considered the case and reached its result, such an articulation is all the more important in those few cases singled out by the Appellate Division for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">sua sponte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> certification. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed their convictions of two counts of rape in the first degree, one count of sodomy in the first degree, and sexual abuse in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted by a jury of two counts of rape in the first degree, one count of sodomy in the first degree, and sexual abuse in the first degree. Their convictions were affirmed by the appellate court. On further appeal, the court reversed their convictions, concluding that the appellate court had failed to determine whether the jury verdict was supported by the weight of the evidence. The appellate court's analysis should not have been limited to a determination that the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence. If, based on all the credible evidence, a different finding would not have been unreasonable, then the appellate court was required to weigh the relative probative force of conflicting testimony and the relative strength of conflicting inferences that could be drawn from the testimony.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Intermediate Appellate Courts -- Reversible Error for Intermediate Appellate Court to Manifestly Avoid Exclusive Statutory Authority to Review Weight of Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. It is reversible error when the Appellate Division manifestly avoids its exclusive statutory authority to review the weight of the evidence in criminal cases.  Accordingly, where the Appellate Division concluded on an appeal from two judgments convicting defendants of rape in the first degree, sodomy in the first degree and sexual abuse in the first degree, that the jury verdict was supported by sufficient evidence, but did not do the factual analysis of whether the jury determination was against the weight of the evidence, a review which may take place only in an intermediate appellate court ( CPL 470.15 [5]), the Appellate Division's order of affirmance is reversed and the case is remitted to the Appellate Division to complete its consideration of the case, including application of its weight of evidence review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Appeal -- Intermediate Appellate Courts -- Standards of Review -- Legal Sufficiency -- Weight of Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although the two standards of intermediate appellate review in criminal cases -- legal sufficiency and weight of evidence -- are related -- each requires a discrete analysis.  To conclude that a jury verdict is supported by sufficient evidence, the intermediate appellate court must determine whether there is any valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences which could lead a rational person to the conclusion reached by the jury on the basis of the evidence at trial and as a matter of law satisfy the proof and burden requirements for every element of the crime charged. If that is satisfied, then the verdict will be upheld by the intermediate appellate court on that review basis.  To determine whether a verdict is supported by the weight of the evidence, however, the intermediate appellate court's dispositive analysis is not limited to that legal test.  If based on all the credible evidence a different finding would not have been unreasonable, then the intermediate appellate court must, like the trier of fact below, weigh the relative probative force of conflicting testimony and the relative strength of conflicting inferences that may be drawn from the testimony.  If it appears that the trier of fact has failed to give the evidence the weight it should be accorded, then the intermediate appellate court may set aside the verdict ( CPL 470.20 [2]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Indians on the reservation believed that they were exempt from state regulation and taxation of motor fuel purchases.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Indian Affairs -- Supremacy Clause</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Regulation of Trade with Indians on Reservations -- Sales of Motor Fuel to Indians on Indian Reservations -- Preemption of New York State Motor Fuel Tax and Motor Fuel Sales Tax by Federal Indian Trader Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action for a declaratory judgment concerning the power of the State Tax Commission to impose a tax on an out-of-State plaintiff's wholesale distribution of motor fuel to Seneca Indian retailers on the Allegany and Cattaraugus Reservations, the Appellate Division erroneously denied a motion by plaintiffs, Herzog Brothers Trucking, Inc. (Herzog), a Pennsylvania corporation engaged in wholesale and retail distribution and sales of motor fuels, and its corporate principals, for a preliminary injunction enjoining and restraining the State of New York from determining, collecting or attempting to collect any motor fuel taxes and sales taxes on the sales of motor fuel (Tax Law arts 12-A, 28) by Herzog to Indians on the Indian reservations and from otherwise interfering with or regulating such sales.  The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution (US Const, art VI, cl 2) invalidates State laws that interfere with, or are contrary to Federal law.  Congress' intent to preempt all State law in a particular area may be inferred where the scheme of Federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that Congress &quot;left no room&quot; for supplementary State regulation. A clear distinction exists between State taxation schemes which merely require Indian retailers to collect a valid tax on non-Indian purchasers and those that burden persons engaged in trade with Indians on reservations. Congress has preempted the field of regulating trade with Indians on reservations and has left &quot;no room&quot; for the application of supplementary State tax laws, such as the one here at issue, that impose &quot;additional burdens&quot; on Indian traders. Thus, no matter how minimal the burden imposed by the motor fuel taxation scheme on Herzog, as a trader to the Seneca Nation, such regulation is preempted by the Federal Indian trader laws and the Appellate Division erred, as a matter of law, in holding that plaintiffs had not established a clear likelihood of success on the merits on their application for a preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. When the Appellate Division denies discretionary relief on an issue of law alone, and makes clear that no question of fact or discretion entered into its decision, that question of law is considered decisive of the correctness of the determination and the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review it on a properly certified question from the Appellate Division.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review the issue before it on appeal by certified question of whether, on a motion for a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs failed to establish, as a matter of law, the requisite clear likelihood of success on the merits of their challenge to the State Tax Commission's imposition of taxes on their motor fuel transactions with the Seneca Nation of Indians residing on the Allegany and Cattaraugus Reservations. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the trial court upon a verdict convicting defendant of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree. Defendant claimed as his defense his personal misunderstanding of the statutory definition of a peace officer. Defendant claimed that he was excused from criminal liability under the mistake of law statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 15.20. The trial court refused to charge the jury on the issue, and defendant was convicted. The appellate division upheld the conviction. On review, the court concluded that the correctly construed view of the defense of mistake or ignorance should not be recognized except where specific intent was an element of the offense or where the mistakenly-relied-upon law was subsequently adjudicated as incorrect. The court determined that such a rule would ensure procedural due process under constitutionally vague statutes, yet not permit the exception to swallow the rule. The forbidden act of possessing a weapon was clear and unambiguous, and the court determined that the defense of mistake did not apply to the situation because the only mistake was in defendant's understanding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Defense of Mistake of Law -- Possession of Weapon Without Permit by Federal Corrections Officer -- Defendant's Personal Misreading or Misunderstanding of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> No Excuse to Criminal Conduct</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The defense of mistake of law (Penal Law &sect; 15.20 [2] [a], [d]) is not available to a Federal corrections officer arrested in a Manhattan social club for possession of a loaded .38 caliber automatic pistol who claimed he mistakenly believed he was entitled, pursuant to the interplay of CPL 2.10, 1.20 and Penal Law &sect; 265.20, to carry a handgun without a permit as a peace officer. The defense of mistake of law should not be recognized, except where specific intent is an element of the offense or where an individual demonstrates an effort to learn what the law is, relies on the validity of that law and, later, it is determined that there was a mistake in the law itself.  The weapon's possession statute violated by this defendant imposes liability irrespective of one's intent.  Further, the forbidden act of possessing a weapon is clear and unambiguous, and only by the interplay of a double exemption does defendant seek to escape criminal responsibility, i.e., the peace officer statute and the mistake statute.  However, the weapon's possession statute never in fact authorized the defendant's conduct; the defendant only thought that the statutory exemptions permitted his conduct when, in fact, the primary statute clearly forbade his conduct.  Moreover, by adjudication of the final court to speak on the subject in this very case, it turned out that even the exemption statute did not permit this defendant to possess the weapon. Accordingly, an order of the Appellate Division affirming defendant Federal corrections officer's conviction for criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, arising out of his possession of a loaded pistol without a permit in a social club, is affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Where defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment upon which he now stands convicted was granted, then it was reversed and the indictment reinstated by a divided Appellate Division, but defendant allowed an appeal from that order, certified to the Court of Appeals, to lapse and be dismissed, review of that aspect of the case is precluded on defendant's present appeal to the Court of Appeals from the subsequent Appellate Division order affirming defendant's conviction.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, on consolidated appeals, sought review of the decisions from the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department and Second Judicial Department (New York), which confirmed the conviction of one defendant for violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 165.25 and reversed the dismissal of charges against the other defendants for violations of &sect; 165.25. Defendants asserted that the statute was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and reinstatement of charges and held that &sect; 165.25, which prohibited jostling, was not vague. The statute specifically prohibited a person from intentionally and unnecessarily placing his hands in the proximity of a person's pocket or handbag or jostling or crowding another person at a time when someone else was doing so. The statute was sufficiently definite as to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of the conduct that was forbidden by the statute and provided explicit standards for the persons applying the statute. The statute was not vague as applied to the defendants who had intentionally gone through the pockets of persons asleep in public. Additionally, the application of the law was not dependent on the subjective conclusions of a complainant or arresting officer. Accordingly, the statute was not void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The jostling statute (Penal Law &sect; 165.25), which prohibits a person from acting with the intent to bring his hand into the proximity of a stranger's pocket or handbag unnecessarily, is not void for vagueness. Penal Law &sect; 165.25 clearly delineates specific conduct easily avoided by the innocent-minded. Moreover, the statute is no more difficult to interpret and obey because it does not require larcenous intent; section 165.25 prohibits a certain intentional course of conduct regardless of the wrongdoer's underlying purpose or motive.  Nor does Penal Law &sect; 165.25 encourage arbitrary or discriminatory application.  The law provides objective criteria which must be observed by a police officer prior to arrest.  It is not dependent upon the subjective conclusions of a complainant or an arresting officer as to what is annoying or suspicious. A person may be arrested pursuant to Penal Law &sect; 165.25 if the police have probable cause to believe, based upon observable conduct, that defendant unnecessarily and intentionally placed his hand in the proximity of another's pocket or handbag.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. On an appeal to the Court of Appeals challenging, on the ground of vagueness, the jostling statute (Penal Law &sect; 165.25), which prohibits a person from acting with the intent to bring his hand into the proximity of a stranger's pocket or handbag unnecessarily, defendants, who do not, nor could they, argue that their own acts should be interpreted as necessary, have no standing to complain of any element of vagueness in the statute concerning possible applications of the word &quot;unnecessarily&quot; which would be outside the statute's intended realm, such as tugging on another's handbag to gain that person's attention, since it has had no effect on these defendants.  The Court of Appeals cannot consider the possibility that the statute may be vague as applied in other hypothetical situations.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, court administrator and judge, challenged the judgment from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which held that N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 302 and N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 299, which related to the duty of plaintiff court reporters to provide transcripts to judges, could not be reconciled and that &sect; 299 was impliedly repealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reporters challenged the directive of the court administrator and the judge ordering judges to request free transcripts pursuant to &sect; 299 and to limit requests under N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 302, which required payment for the transcripts. The court reporters commenced their action seeking a declaratory judgment that the directives were illegal and that N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 299 was void, and the court reporters sought damages and an injunction. The appellate court held that the two statutory sections could not be reconciled and that &sect; 299 was impliedly repealed. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that there was no clear evidence that the legislature intended to repeal &sect; 299 and that the legislature had amended &sect; 299 several times, which strongly indicated that there was no intent to repeal the section. The court concluded that each section had a separate field of operation, and the two statutes were able to coexist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court and entered judgment in favor of the court administrator and judge, holding that the statute requiring the court reporters to provide judges with gratuitous copies of transcripts was neither repealed nor illegal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Judiciary Law &sect; 299, which requires that stenographic transcripts requested by Judges for their own use be furnished by court reporters free of charge, is neither impliedly repealed by the 1936 amendment of what is now Judiciary Law &sect; 302 -- providing that the stenographer is entitled to fees for transcripts furnished to Judges in civil as well as criminal cases -- nor illegal.  Here, there is no clear evidence that the Legislature intended to repeal section 299; since 1936, section 299 has both been amended by the Legislature and applied by the courts to transcripts ordered by Judges.  Moreover, a reasonable field of operation can be found for each statute.  Where Judges request transcripts imposing the extraordinary demand of daily or expedited copy, compensation at public expense is contemplated by section 302.  Correlatively, where regular transcripts are in issue -- those which can be supplied under ordinary circumstances after the conclusion of the proceedings -- section 299 requires that they be furnished without charge.  Given that there has been no express repeal, that the Legislature has evidenced its intent to keep both sections alive by continuing to amend both, and that some separate field of operation can be found for each, Judiciary Law &sect; 299 remains viable, and the various communications issued by defendants, the Chief Administrator of the Courts and the District Administrative Judge, directing that transcripts ordinarily be ordered for free pursuant to section 299, are within its scope.  Nor has there been either an unconstitutional or an impermissible usurpation of authority by defendants; it is the statutes and not the defendants that direct when stenographers should receive additional compensation for Judges' transcripts.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), affirming a county court's felony verdict convicting defendant of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on the charge of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated. Defendant presented evidence that his only consumption of alcohol the day of the arrest was two drinks, which evidence entitled him to an instruction on the lesser included offense of operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by the consumption of alcohol. Defense counsel requested an instruction that the jury could consider the lesser included offense, not only if it found defendant not guilty of the greater but also if it could &quot;not reach&quot; or was &quot;unable&quot; to reach a verdict on the greater offense. The trial court denied the request, and the jury found defendant guilty of the greater offense, which was affirmed on appeal. Defendant sought further judicial review. The court held that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 300.50(4) dictated that a verdict of guilty of any offense was not deemed an acquittal of any lesser offense submitted, but was deemed an acquittal of every greater offense submitted. Moreover, the court determined that the prosecution should not be precluded from retrying a defendant on the greater offense unless a jury actually found him innocent of that charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion and held that the jury instructions to the jury in conjunction with its submission of a lesser included offense was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On an appeal from an order of the Appellate Division which affirmed the judgment convicting defendant of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol as a felony, the Court of Appeals is not foreclosed from reaching the alleged error in the trial court's transition instruction regarding the jury's consideration of the lesser included offense of operating a motor vehicle while defendant's ability was impaired by the consumption of alcohol because the jury found the defendant guilty of the greater, and thus had no occasion to consider the lesser,  offense.  Although the issue is not the court's refusal to submit a lesser included crime for the jury's consideration but the nature in which such crime was presented, it appears that the jury's finding the defendant guilty of the immediately higher crime could have been influenced by the transition instruction of which defendant now complains, which would not be true had his complaint been about the way in which a more remote degree of crime were presented to the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Lesser Included Offense -- Right of Defendant to Receive &quot;Unable to Agree&quot; Transition Instruction upon Request</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In the prosecution of defendant, who was indicted for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated as a felony in violation of Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 (3) and (5), the trial court correctly rejected the defendant's request for a transition instruction that the jury could consider the lesser included offense of operating a motor vehicle while his ability was impaired by the consumption of alcohol (Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 1192 [1]) not only if it found the defendant not guilty of the greater offense, but also if it could &quot;not reach&quot; or was &quot;unable&quot; to reach a verdict on the greater offense, and correctly instructed the jury to consider the lesser included offense only upon reaching a unanimous verdict of not guilty of the greater offense. The enactment of present CPL 300.50, although linguistically different from its statutory predecessors, was intended merely to reflect current judicial interpretation of the prior statute (former Code Crim Pro &sect; 444) pursuant to which the jury was authorized to find defendant guilty of any lesser included offense only after they found him not guilty of the greater offense. Additionally, approval of the &quot;unable to agree&quot; transition charge sought by the defendant would have a deleterious effect on the People, for whose benefit the option of the submission of a lesser included offense was originally created to prevent the prosecution from failing where some element of the crime charged was not made out.  Moreover, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">United States v Tsanas</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (572 F2d 340) and its progeny, which hold that a defendant is entitled to an &quot;unable to agree&quot; transition charge upon timely request, are rejected because they give insufficient weight to the principle that it is the duty of the jury not to reach compromise verdicts based on sympathy for the defendant or to appease holdouts, but to render a just verdict by applying the facts it finds to the law it is charged.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff private club association challenged, on constitutional grounds, New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 63 (1984), which prohibited discrimination by local clubs. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed an order and judgment of the trial court granting defendant city summary judgment, and declaring that Local Laws No. 63 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The private club association argued that Local Law No. 63 violated the home rule provision of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(c) claiming it was inconsistent with New York City, N.Y,. Admin. Code &sect; 8-107 and, therefore, constituted an invalid exercise of the city's police power. The association did not question the city's underlying authority to exercise the police power it possesses in the area of human rights and acknowledged that the state had not preempted the field of antidiscrimination legislation by enacting human rights legislation. The association only questioned the statutory scheme under the local law. The court found that the city had a compelling interest in prohibiting discrimination by private clubs, which had an effect on employment and business benefits. Any infringement on the association's freedom to engage as a group in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends, therefore, was permissible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Home Rule Powers -- Validity of New York City Human Rights Law Prohibiting Discrimination in Clubs Not &quot;Distinctly Private&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Local Laws, 1984, No. 63 of City of New York, which is intended to prohibit discrimination in those clubs which, in essence, provide benefits to business entities and to persons other than their own members, thereby assuming a sufficient public character that they should forfeit the &quot;distinctly private&quot; exemption of the City's Human Rights Law (Administrative Code of City of New York tit 8), is a valid and constitutional exercise of the police power of the City of New York.  The State has not preempted the field of antidiscrimination legislation by enacting the State Human Rights Law (Executive Law &sect; 290 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">), and no impermissible inconsistency exists between the State statute itself and the definition provided by Local Law No. 63.  The State Human Rights Law excludes from the definition of &quot;public accommodation&quot; &quot;any institution, club or place of accommodation which is in its nature distinctly private&quot; (Executive Law &sect; 292 [9]), but contains no legislative definition of the term &quot;distinctly private&quot;.  In interpreting the term &quot;distinctly private&quot; in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of United States Power Squadrons v State Human Rights Appeal Bd.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (59 N.Y.2d 401, 412), the Court of Appeals said that the hallmark of the private club was its &quot;selectivity in its membership&quot;.  Local Law No. 63 merely spells out objectively in more concrete terms the circumstances when a club, because of its large size, &quot;public nature,&quot; and volume of business-related activities will be deemed to have lost the essential characteristic of privateness -- i.e., selectivity. Therefore, Local Law No. 63's definition of &quot;distinctly private&quot; is not inconsistent with the use of this term in Executive Law &sect; 292 (9) as interpreted in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Power Squadrons</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and, thus, Local Law No. 63 does not violate the &quot;home rule&quot; provision of the New York State Constitution (art IX, &sect; 2 [c]).  Moreover, Local Law No. 63 is not inconsistent with </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Power Squadrons</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on the ground that activity which arguably would be permitted under State decisional law is prohibited by the local law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Rights -- Discrimination in Public Accommodation -- New York City Human Rights Law -- Exemption for &quot;Distinctly Private&quot; Club -- Burden of Establishing Exemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Local Laws, 1984, No. 63 of City of New York, which is intended to prohibit discrimination in those clubs which, in essence, provide benefits to business entities and to persons other than their own members, thereby assuming a sufficient public character that they should forfeit the &quot;distinctly private&quot; exemption of the City's Human Rights Law (Administrative Code of City of New York tit 8), does not impermissibly shift the onerous burden of establishing exemption on the clubs. Any allocation of the burden of proof effected by the enactment bears a reasonable relationship to the police power and is reasonably calculated to achieve by objective means the legitimate purpose of ensuring that only &quot;distinctly private&quot; clubs be exempt.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Right to Privacy -- Freedom of Speech -- Freedom of Association -- New York City Human Rights Law -- Prohibition of Discrimination in Clubs Not &quot;Distinctly Private&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Local Laws, 1984, No. 63 of City of New York, which is intended to prohibit discrimination in those clubs which, in essence, provide benefits to business entities and to persons other than their own members, thereby assuming a sufficient public character that they should forfeit the &quot;distinctly private&quot; exemption of the City's Human Rights Law (Administrative Code of City of New York tit 8), does not violate plaintiff New York State Club Association's members' rights to privacy, free speech and association under the Federal Constitution.  The definition read into the City Human Rights Law under </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Matter of United States Power Squadrons v State Human Rights Appeal Bd</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. (59 NY2d 401) of &quot;distinctly private&quot; and the three-prong test set forth in Local Law No. 63 itself, together adequately assess &quot;objective characteristics&quot; of the organizations at issue.  The law in effect deems a club that is large and where much of the activity central to the maintenance of the association involves the participation of strangers to that relationship to have lost any claimed protection of intimate association.  Further, compelling governmental interests, unrelated to the suppression of ideas -- here the City's strong public policy to eliminate discrimination against women and minorities -- manifestly justify some infringement of the freedom of expressive association.  Moreover, through Local Law No. 63, the City has employed the least restrictive means to achieve its ends.  Finally, although plaintiff's constituent members have a right to free speech and to association, they lack the right to practice invidious discrimination against women and minorities in the distribution of important business advantages and privileges.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the landlords' motion for summary judgment declaring N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law art. 7-C&nbsp;unconstitutional and granted the board's motion declaring the statute constitutional. The trial court granted the landlords' motion seeking an order in the nature of mandamus compelling the board to schedule hardship hearings with respect to buildings for which exemptions to the allowable costs were claimed. Both parties sought review, and the lower court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed as to the finding that N.Y. Mult. Dwell. Law art. 7-C was constitutional. The statute was supported by a legitimate concern that loft buildings were being converted to residential use without compliance with applicable building codes, and thus the statute was a valid exercise of the police power.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Loft Law (Multiple Dwelling Law art 7-C) is not in conflict with the due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and article I, &sect; 6 of the New York State Constitution; it is apparent from the legislative findings that the enactment is supported by a legitimate concern that loft buildings are being converted to residential use without compliance with applicable building codes, that many of those buildings do not conform to minimum standards for health, safety and fire protection, and that an acute shortage of housing already exists.  The statute establishes a reasonable means to meet these legislative concerns and is, therefore, a valid exercise of the police power; there is no merit to the claim that the statute violates the equal protection clauses of the State or Federal Constitution (US Const 14th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 11), and there was no showing that the statute, as applied, contravened constitutional proscriptions against taking without just compensation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Retirement and Pension Benefits -- Constitutionality of Proscription against Simultaneous Receipt of Pension Benefits and Salary Payments -- Judges Who Retired Prior to Commencement of New Terms of Office</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State Comptroller did not contravene NY Constitution, article V, &sect; 7 when, following the enactment of Laws of 1984 (ch 117), he suspended the retirement benefits of appellants, sitting Judges of the Unified Court System who, following their respective reelections in November of various years since 1977 but prior to commencing their new terms of office in January of the following year, applied to the New York State Retirement System for retirement benefits, thereafter retired on or before the date of the commencement of their new term of office and then, after commencement of their respective new terms of office, received both retirement benefits and the salary for their judicial offices simultaneously.  The 1984 amendment to Civil Service Law &sect; 150 (L 1984, ch 117) prospectively prohibits incumbents who have won reelection to the same office from receiving salary payments and retirement benefits simultaneously where they have retired subsequent to reelection but prior to assuming their new term of office, and the 1984 amendment cannot be applied retroactively. However, although all of the appellants retired prior to the effective date of the 1984 amendment to Civil Service Law &sect; 150, appellants had no statutory or contractual entitlement at the time that they retired to receive their retirement benefits while simultaneously receiving salary payments for their judicial offices; thus, the subsequent suspension of retirement benefits did not violate NY Constitution, article V, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Retirement and Pension Benefits -- Proscription against Simultaneous Receipt of Retirement Benefits and Salary Payments -- Applicability of &quot;Elective Public Office&quot; Exception to Judges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. There is a strong public policy in favor of the suspension of retirement benefits of a person who after retiring accepts an office in the civil service of the State.  Although exceptions have been made to this general proscription, appellants, sitting Judges of the Unified Court System, do not fall within the exception provided in Civil Service Law &sect; 150 for an &quot;elective public office&quot;.  Initially, this exception was limited to local elective public officers; the expansion of this exception in 1975 by the amendment of Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 101 (d) (3) to include both State and local elective officers was intended to do no more than provide an exemption from the suspension requirement to retired police and firemen who are elected to State elective public office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Retirement and Pension Benefits -- Proscription against Simultaneous Receipt of Retirement Benefits and Salary Payments -- Exemption for Retiree Aged 70 or Older</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Inasmuch as appellant Maresca, a sitting Judge of the Unified Court System who reached the age of 70 on May 27, 1984, was receiving both retirement benefits and the salary for his judicial office simultaneously, and claims that Retirement and Social Security Law &sect; 212 exempts him from the suspension of his retirement allowance and respondents have not disputed the applicability of this statute to him, the petition of appellant in a proceeding challenging a determination of the State Comptroller, which, following enactment of Laws of 1984 (ch 117), suspended the payment of appellant's retirement benefits, is granted.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department, 2nd and 11th Judicial Districts (New York), that affirmed his conviction for unlawful exposure, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.01.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On two occasions, defendant engaged in nude sunbathing on a public beach that had informally come to be known as a clothing optional beach. After complaints of nudism from residents and visitors to the beach, defendant was arrested and twice convicted of unlawful exposure, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 245.01. The appellate division affirmed the convictions. Defendant then appealed on constitutional grounds. In affirming, the court ruled that defendant's actions did not constitute expressive conduct because no message was being conveyed by his nudity. Even if it was expression, the prohibition on public nudity did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I, or N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, because it furthered an important government interest that was unrelated to the suppression of expression and any restrictions on expression were incidental and no greater than were essential to the government interest. Moreover, any arguable overbreadth of the statute was insubstantial and thus permissible. Finally, nude sunbathing in public was not a fundamental right protected by U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed because defendant's conduct of nude sunbathing on a public beach did not constitute constitutionally protected expressive conduct; prohibitions on public nudity furthered an important government interest that was unrelated to free expression and any restriction on expression was incidental; the statute was not overbroad or otherwise unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Exposure -- Nude Sunbathing on Public Beach</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant's State and Federal constitutional rights (US Const 1st Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 8) were not violated by his convictions for unlawful exposure (Penal Law &sect; 245.01) as a result of his nude sunbathing on a public beach. Defendant's conduct did not rise to the level of communication necessary to invoke constitutional protection, since nude sunbathing on a beach is not a form of expression likely to be understood by the viewer as an attempt to convey a particular point of view.  Even if defendant's actions were expressive, the State had the power to regulate such expression by prohibiting the public display of nudity; prohibiting public nudity is within the State's police powers, the statute is not aimed at suppressing the expression of opinion concerning nudity but neutrally prohibits all public displays of nudity regardless of the actor's purpose, the statute furthers an important governmental objective, and, as applied, is as narrow as it can be in order to fulfill its governmental objective.  Any arguable overbreadth of the statute is insubstantial, and finally, there is no fundamental right to appear nude in public.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A certified question was sent for review from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) on whether appellant district attorney's motion to confirm attachments and motion for preliminary injunction in post-conviction civil forfeiture action were properly modified and vacated. Appellant asserted that under the express terms of N.Y. C.P.L.R. art 13-A, the attachment of assets was properly granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant district attorney initiated a post-conviction civil forfeiture action against respondent corporation and two criminal defendants, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 13-A. Appellant obtained ex parte orders to attach the assets of defendants. Appellant sought to confirm the orders of attachment and for a preliminary injunction to prevent the transfer of the assets. Defendants opposed appellant's motion and moved to vacate the ex parte orders, which was denied. Appellant's motion to confirm was granted, but was modified and vacated on review. It was then sent for review as a certified question. The court reversed the order vacating the attachment and held that art 13-A satisfied constitutional requirements of due process because it provided provisional remedies. However, the court held that an erroneous rule of law was applied in deciding if appellant had sustained his burden of establishing a substantial probability of success in the forfeiture action, the failure to grant provisional remedies would result in destruction or removal of the property, and the need to preserve the availability of the property through the provisional remedy outweighed the hardship to defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order vacating the attachment in a post-conviction civil forfeiture action and held that the forfeiture statute satisfied constitutional requirements of due process because it provided provisional remedies to criminal defendants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Forfeitures and Penalties -- Forfeiture of Proceeds of Crime -- Availability of Provisional Remedies in Forfeiture Action against Putative &quot;Criminal Defendants&quot; Who are Indicted but Not Yet Convicted -- Provisional Remedies Not Limited to Assets Traceable to Alleged Crimes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The fact that defendants have not yet been convicted of the &quot;post-conviction forfeiture crimes&quot; for which they have been indicted does not bar plaintiff claiming authority from commencing a forfeiture action pursuant to CPLR article 13-A against them as putative &quot;criminal defendants&quot;.  The statute ( CPLR 1311 [1] [a]) authorizes the commencement of a forfeiture action against putative &quot;criminal defendants&quot; who have been indicted but not convicted although it is equally clear that the court may not grant a forfeiture of the seized assets unless there is a subsequent conviction in the underlying felony prosecution.  It is equally plain that the statutory scheme contemplates the availability of provisional remedies in such an action against a &quot;criminal defendant&quot; to ensure the availability of assets to satisfy a potential judgment.  A provisional remedy in an action against a &quot;criminal defendant&quot; is not limited to assets that can be traced to the alleged crimes but can reach any assets of the defendants that could be used to satisfy a potential judgment in the forfeiture action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Forfeitures and Penalties -- Forfeiture of Proceeds of Crime -- Provisional Remedies -- Procedural Due Process of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The procedures provided in CPLR article 13-A relative to the grant of a provisional remedy in a forfeiture action satisfy minimum procedural due process requirements.  The availability of provisional remedies serves the substantial governmental need of preventing the judicial process from being frustrated by the dissipation of assets that will potentially satisfy a civil judgment.  Article 13-A, in what appear to be carefully and comprehensively drawn provisions, establishes an elaborate array of safeguards against erroneous deprivation of defendants' property through the imposition of a provisional remedy. That procedures more protective of the defendants' interests can be imagined or suggested does not in any way undermine the conclusion that article 13-A is not violative of Federal procedural due process requirements because the statute as written contains sufficient safeguards to minimize the risk of an erroneous deprivation of a defendant's protected interest and any additional safeguards would not substantially decrease this risk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Forfeitures and Penalties -- Forfeiture of Proceeds of Crime -- Provisional Remedies -- Right to Counsel -- Infringement of Ability to Hire Chosen Counsel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. On its face, the statutory scheme of CPLR article 13-A relative to the grant of a provisional remedy in a forfeiture action does not violate defendants' right to counsel. Although a factual scenario may arise where the pre-conviction attachment of a defendant's assets will infringe the ability to hire chosen counsel, the statutory scheme of article 13-A adequately addresses this potential problem by expressly requiring the claiming authority to prove that the need for the provisional remedy outweighs the hardship on any party against whom the order may operate ( CPLR 1312 [3]).  Moreover, the statute allows a defendant to move to vacate or modify the attachment ( CPLR 1329) and allows the court, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">sua sponte</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, to dismiss the action in the interests of justice upon consideration of &quot;the impact of forfeiture of property upon the person who committed the crime&quot; ( CPLR 1311 [4] [d] [i]).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town challenged a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which reversed the trial court's grant of plaintiff property owners' motion for summary judgment that declared N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 729-738, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners brought an action to have &sect;&sect; 729-738 declared unconstitutional and asserted that it was a denial of equal protection to only permit some property owners to use the residential assessment ration and comparison to prove their property tax was assessed at a higher proportion. The appellate division reversed the trial court's grant of the property owners' motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court stated that the differentiation between owners of one, two, and three family residences and other property owners was rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose. The court stated that it could not be said that the classification resulted in a differentiation that was arbitrary because it established a small claim procedures which was limited to those that sought a reduction not in excess of $ 750.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Real Property Tax Law, article 7, title 1-A, which established an informal small claims procedure to review assessments of owner-occupied one-, two- or three-family dwellings where the amount challenged does not exceed $ 750, is constitutional; there can be no question that the differentiation between owners of one-, two- or three-family residences and other property owners is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose, viz., to afford small property owners relief from the complex and expensive formal review procedure.  While the statute provides for the preparation by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment of a residential assessment ratio (Real Property Tax Law &sect; 738) which is not used in other than small claims review proceedings, the same data may be presented by taxpayers involved in such other proceedings; the fact that some other property owners will be owners of multiple residences for more than three families rather than commercial property does not render the classification arbitrary since plaintiffs have not shown that the Legislature could not properly conclude that the difference in return from such properties warranted exclusion of them from the small claims procedure.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of Real Property Tax Law, article 7, title 1-A, which established an informal small claims procedure to review assessments of owner-occupied one-, two- or three-family dwellings where the amount challenged does not exceed $ 750, plaintiffs' contention that Real Property Tax Law &sect; 305 (2), which requires all real property in each assessing unit to be assessed at a uniform percentage of value, bars classification except as to an assessing unit which has adopted Real Property Tax Law article 19, under which varying rates within an assessing unit are permissible, is without merit since the small claims procedure, which contemplates the possibility of a correction in assessment (Real Property Tax Law &sect; 733 [2]), not rates (and makes clear that the small claims procedure has no precedential value [Real Property Tax Law &sect; 735]), is not in conflict with the town's article 19 option.  The Legislature did not intend to make a property owner's use of the small claims procedure turn on whether the assessing unit had so opted, since that could result in complete frustration of its purpose in enacting that procedure.  </SPAN></P>

Judiciary Law &sect; 148-a was one of a series of legislative responses to rising medical malpractice insurance rates.  Since the legislation bears a rational relationship to the need of reducing the cost of medical malpractice litigation and helping preserve quality health care in this State, it does not violate substantive due process concerns.  Insofar as petitioner claims that the mediation process is procedurally unfair because it has delayed the trial of her medical malpractice action, petitioner has failed to demonstrate that her case has not moved toward hearing in timely fashion. Petitioner has not established that the time involved in her case differs significantly from other malpractice actions or that she has been prejudiced as a result of it.  Even if petitioner could demonstrate egregious delay, any claimed constitutional violation would in most, if not all, cases be obviated by other remedies available to her.  Although nothing in the statute appears to permit respondents to waive pretrial malpractice mediation, they may, in their discretion, transfer the matter to another county.  The Appellate Division declined to exercise its discretion to do so in this case and there is no basis for petitioner's claim that its determination resulted in an unconstitutional denial of due process.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant church sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) that affirmed a judgment of the supreme court that an action under New York City Landmarks Preservation Law, New York, N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church developed a rebuilding program, which included plans for the complete renovation and construction of a commercial high-rise condominium on part of the property. The commission designated the church and parish house as a landmark. The church contended that the Landmarks Law, as applied to it by virtue of the commission's designation, effected a taking of property without due process or just compensation and interfered with the free exercise of its religion in contravention of various provisions of the Federal and New York State Constitutions. On the commission's motion for summary judgment, the supreme court dismissed the declaratory judgment action as not ripe. The appellate division affirmed. The court of appeals determined that the church's claim of constitutional harm was not ripe. The court found that the issue was not appropriate for judicial review because neither the finality requirement, nor the requirement that the issue be purely legal was met. Neither did the church make the second showing that the impact of the administrative action would be direct and immediate and felt in a concrete way. The church's status as a religious organization had no relevance.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In a declaratory judgment action, plaintiff church's claim that the New York City Landmarks Preservation Law (Administrative Code of City of New York, ch 8-A, &sect; 205-1.0 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as made applicable to plaintiff by virtue of the designation of its property as a landmark, is unconstitutional as applied because of the effect of that statute in obstructing or interfering with plaintiff's rebuilding program and subjecting plaintiff to immediate repair and maintenance requirements which carry criminal sanctions, thereby interfering with plaintiff's ability to carry out its charitable purpose, is not ripe for judicial determination. The issue presented is not &quot;appropriate&quot; for judicial review. Finality is lacking because the effect on plaintiff of being subjected to the Landmarks Law is incomplete and undetermined.  The effect cannot be measured until plaintiff has sought and the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (Commission) has granted or denied a certificate of appropriateness (Administrative Code &sect; 207-6.0) or other approval of plaintiff's rebuilding program.  Further, the issue presented is not &quot;purely legal&quot;.  The ultimate resolution of this constitutional issue will require a careful examination of facts not yet developed pertaining to plaintiff's financial situation and to whatever action the Commission takes with respect to plaintiff's rebuilding program.  Nor has plaintiff made the required showing that the impact of the administrative action be &quot;direct and immediate&quot; and &quot;felt in a concrete way&quot;; as yet, there can be no such harm for there has been no interference.  Neither can plaintiff claim direct and immediate harm from the imposition of the Landmarks Law's repair and maintenance requirements.  Plaintiff's plans, which it refuses to submit to the Commission for approval, include renovation of the interior and exterior of the church and would, if approved, result in compliance with the very statutory requirements plaintiff contends the Commission's designation causes it to violate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Declaratory Judgments -- When Remedy Appropriate -- Ripeness of Issue for Judicial Determination -- Theoretical Subjection of Church to Criminal Sanctions of Landmarks Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Plaintiff church's declaratory judgment action does not present an issue ripe for judicial determination to the extent that it is based on plaintiff's claim that the New York City Landmarks Preservation Law (Administrative Code of City of New York, ch 8-A, &sect; 205-1.0 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> , as made applicable to plaintiff by virtue of the designation of its property as a landmark, is unconstitutional because plaintiff is theoretically subject to criminal sanctions for noncompliance with the Landmarks Law's repair and maintenance requirements </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Administrative Code &sect;&sect; 207-10.0, 207-16.0).  Plaintiff does not allege that these requirements have been enforced; nothing in the record suggests that imposition of criminal sanctions has been threatened or even intimated.  Moreover, plaintiff's claim will require a resolution of factual issues; and where, as here, a claim of unconstitutional application of a criminal statute involves factual as well as legal questions, it should be determined within the criminal proceeding itself.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Declaratory Judgments -- When Remedy Appropriate -- Ripeness of Issue for Judicial Determination -- Effect of Plaintiff's Status as Church -- Claim Based on Prospective Interference of Landmarks Law with Free Exercise of Religion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In a declaratory judgment action based on plaintiff church's claim that the New York City Landmarks Preservation Law (Administrative Code of City of New York, ch 8-A, &sect; 205-1.0 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, as made applicable to plaintiff by virtue of the designation of its property as a landmark, is unconstitutional as applied because of the effect of that statute in obstructing or interfering with plaintiff's rebuilding program and subjecting plaintiff to immediate repair and maintenance requirements which carry criminal sanctions, the decision that plaintiff's claim is not ripe for judicial determination should not be different because plaintiff is a church and bases its constitutional claim in part on prospective interference with its right of free exercise of religion </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">(see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, US Const 1st Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 3).  Irrespective of plaintiff's status as a church, the ultimate determination of the constitutional issue must depend on future developments and particularly on what action the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission takes with respect to plaintiff's renovation plans.  What plaintiff must prove to establish its constitutional claim as a charity under the established standard is neither dependent upon nor peculiar to its religious character.  Plaintiff's claim -- founded on alleged interference with its building program and its inability to afford the repair requirements of the Landmarks Law -- takes on incidental First Amendment overtones only because it is a church. That fact is simply not germane to the ripeness issue here.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Commissioner of the Department of Finance of the City of New York appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Judicial Department (New York), which granted petitioner public utility's request to annul the commissioner's determinations denying claims by the public utility for refunds of New York City utility taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public utility sought refunds for taxes it paid in excess of 1 percent for certain periods, contending that the commissioner lacked authority to adopt a law taxing the utility's gross income at 2.35 percent. The court declined to address the utility's claims that a retroactive income tax was unconstitutional, instead determining as a matter of statutory construction that the city was authorized to impose the 2.35 percent rate. The court concluded that the city's tax authorization statute had a cross reference to N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 20-b, upon which the utility based its challenge to the 2.35 percent rate, but that the city's tax authorization actually derived not from &sect; 20-b but rather a series of enabling acts. Moreover, the legislature had expressly exempted New York City from the 1 percent ceiling imposed on other cities by virtue of &sect; 20-b. The court acknowledged that the cross reference in the city's tax authorization statutes to &sect; 20-b was not a model of clarity, but concluded that the apparently conflicting provisions could be harmonized. Furthermore, it was improper to employ a construction that rendered the statutory provision stating the 2.35 percent a nullity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the appellate court and reinstated the commissioner's determinations that the utility's tax rate was 2.35 percent.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- New York City Utility Tax -- Rate of Tax</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a proceeding to annul determinations of the Commissioner of the Department of Finance of the City of New York denying petitioner's claims for refunds of New York City utility taxes, an order of the Appellate Division, which annulled the determinations, should be reversed and the determinations reinstated. The apparently conflicting statutory provisions governing city utility taxes may be harmonized in order to give effect to all of their parts.  Tax Law &sect; 1201 may be read as fixing the rate ceiling for New York City at 2.35% and Tax Law &sect; 1221 (and General City Law &sect; 20-b) may be read as restricting the tax base for the city.  So read, all of the provisions are given effect; if not so read, section 1221, which states that the rate is 2.35%, would be rendered a nullity, a construction that is not permissible.  Moreover, a minor, unexplained omission of language expressly indicating that New York City was not subject to the 1% rate ceiling in connection with a general revision of the statute should not be construed as changing a long-standing rule in the absence of a clear manifestation of such intention particularly where, as here, an expressed intention of the 1965 revision was simply to incorporate and preserve existing tax powers.  Accordingly, the determinations of the Department of Finance properly fixed petitioner's tax at the 2.35% rate and should be reinstated. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owned a junkyard, dismantled automobiles, and sold parts. Defendant did not have a record of all vehicles and parts in the possession of the vehicle dismantler, as required by N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 415-a(5)(a). Police officers conducted a warrantless search of defendant's premises under N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 415-a and N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Vehicle and Traffic Law &sect; 415-a (5) (a), which authorizes warrantless inspections of vehicle dismantling businesses, and New York City Charter &sect; 436, which authorizes warrantless searches of junkyards and other businesses storing used, discarded or secondhand merchandise, violate the constitutional proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures. The fundamental defect in the statutes is that they authorize searches undertaken solely to uncover evidence of criminality and not to enforce a comprehensive regulatory scheme. In conducting a search pursuant to section 436, the police clearly are not determining compliance with any administrative or regulatory scheme since the provision contains no record-keeping requirements, but rather, explicitly authorizes searches to be undertaken &quot;in connection with the performance of any police duties&quot;.  Although section 415-a does contain some suggestion of an administrative scheme by imposing licensing and record-keeping requirements, and it authorizes inspectors to make unannounced visits to regulated premises to examine required books and records, as it may properly do, it fails to satisfy the constitutional requirements for a valid, comprehensive regulatory scheme, inasmuch as it permits searches of vehicles and vehicle parts notwithstanding the absence of any records against which the findings of such a search could be compared.  Furthermore, an otherwise invalid search of private property is not rendered reasonable merely because it is authorized by a statute.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of orders in two cases that dismissing his appeals as of right, in which he challenged the excessiveness of a negotiated sentence imposed by a judgment rendered upon a guilty plea.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">CPL 450.10, as amended by Laws of 1984 (ch 671), in purporting to disallow an appeal as of right to the Appellate Division where the sole issue raised is the excessiveness of a negotiated sentence imposed by a judgment rendered upon a guilty plea, imposes a limitation or condition on the jurisdiction of the Appellate Division of Supreme Court in contravention of NY Constitution, article VI, &sect; 4 (k).  The controlling constitutional provision permits the Legislature to expand the jurisdiction of the Appellate Division but not contract it, except with regard to appeals from nonfinal orders.  The statutory abrogation of the right to appeal, leaving only the right to seek leave of a single Justice, not even the court itself, to take an appeal, represents both a limitation and condition on the formerly existing right to appeal from a final judgment or sentence. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner police officer sought review of an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) that reversed an order that remanded the police officer's action to respondent police commissioner (commissioner) for a hearing, denied the police officer's motion to restore the matter to the calendar, and dismissed the police officer's petition seeking reinstatement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a prior proceeding, the police officer was convicted of two felony counts of criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree. The conviction was affirmed by the appellate division; however, the court of appeals reversed the conviction and dismissed the indictment. The police officer had been discharged from his position as a police officer and once his conviction was reversed he sought reinstatement to full duty with the police department. The commissioner denied the police officer's application and the police officer filed an action seeking reinstatement. The trial court granted the police officer's petition by remanding the matter to the commissioner for a hearing. On appeal the appellate court reversed the trial court's order, denied the police officer's motion to restore the proceeding to the calendar, and dismissed the petition. The police officer appealed and the court affirmed the appellate court's order and held that under the plain meaning of N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 30, once the police officer was convicted he was automatically terminated and he no longer had a protectable property interest in an office that mandated a reinstatement hearing.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Constitutionally protected property rights in a public office are created and their dimensions defined by State law,  and while the Civil Service Law creates a protected property interest in a police officer's position, Public Officers Law &sect; 30 (1) (e) mandates that a public office automatically becomes vacant upon an officer's conviction of a felony; accordingly, when petitioner, a former police officer, was convicted of a felony, his position terminated and under State law he no longer had a protectable property interest in the office that would mandate a reinstatement hearing, notwithstanding the fact that his conviction was reversed upon appeal.  The Legislature has yet to alter the law and carve out a statutory exception in cases where a public officer has been wrongfully convicted. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action to declare unconstitutional&nbsp;Tax Law &sect; 301 (a), which imposed a gross receipts tax on petroleum businesses, an order of the Appellate Division, which reversed a judgment declaring the tax unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff and declared that plaintiff's sale of jet fuel to the Federal Government was properly taxable under the statute, should be affirmed for the reasons stated in the memorandum at the Appellate Division.  In addition, the legislative history establishes that the tax was intended to apply to all competing petroleum businesses, and, with the exception of residential fuel and petrochemical feedstocks, to virtually all petroleum sold in the State.  Therefore, &quot;aviation fuel&quot;, as used in Tax Law &sect; 300 (b), covers the fuel sold by plaintiff to the Federal Government notwithstanding that its chemical composition differs from that of commercial aviation fuel. Plaintiff's various constitutional theories, newly advanced in the Court of Appeals, shall not be considered even though they were within the constitutional concepts presented in the complaint, since plaintiff conceded that they were not argued in the courts below, and, thus, they have not been preserved for review in the Court of Appeals.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee landowner brought an action against appellant village, asserting that an ordinance that allowed the village to recover costs of a street improvement in a civil action was unconstitutional. The village brought a counterclaim to recover the costs of the improvements. The trial court rendered judgment for the village. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) reversed. The village appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village enacted a maintenance standard for private roads through a local ordinance. Under the ordinance, the village was empowered to bring the roadway to standard and recover the cost from the owner in a civil action. The village served notice on a landowner that his roadway was improperly maintained. When the landowner failed to correct the condition, the village constructed a fully complying road. The trial court held that the ordinance was constitutional and found for the village on its counterclaim. The appellate court held that the maintenance standards were not reasonably necessary and dismissed the village's counterclaim. On appeal, the court held that the village was empowered to enact standards for the maintenance of roads, and thus the ordinance was not unconstitutional. However, the court held that to the extent that the recoupment provisions of the ordinance conflicted with its enabling statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Village Law &sect; 4-414, the ordinance was invalid. In addition, the court held that the village was required to comply with the competitive bidding procedures under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect;103.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the appellate court's order by deleting the provision declaring the entire ordinance unconstitutional and substituting a provision declaring the ordinance constitutional to the extent that it authorized repairs to private roads and invalid to the extent that its recoupment provisions conflicted with the state enabling statute. The court affirmed the order as modified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Village Ordinance Establishing Maintenance Standards for Private Roads -- Recoupment of Funds Expended by Village to Bring Roadway to Standard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Avon Village Ordinance, which sets &quot;Maintenance Standards&quot; for private roads and empowers the Village to expend funds to bring the roadway to standard and recover the cost from the owner in a civil suit if the owner fails to comply with the provisions of the ordinance within 10 days of the notice given by the Village to do so, is constitutional to the extent that it authorizes repairs to private roads.  The Village may constitutionally impose strict maintenance standards upon private road owners; the expressed legislative judgment, presumptively the product of appropriate investigation and study, that properly maintained private roads are essential to the health and safety of the community, may not, without more, be overridden by the judiciary.  Nonetheless, the ordinance is invalid to the extent that its recoupment provisions conflict with Village Law &sect; 4-414, the enabling State legislation, which contemplates an in rem proceeding involving a three-step process of first making an assessment and then a levy, before the costs may be collected.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Bids and Bidders -- Failure of Village to Follow Statutorily Required Bid Procedure -- Liability of Third Party for Expenditures of Village under Void Contract</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Where, pursuant to the Avon Village Ordinance, the Village served notice upon plaintiff that his private roadway was improperly maintained and, upon plaintiff's failure to correct the condition within 10 days, the Village constructed a fully complying road at an expense of $ 8,374.49,  the failure of the Village to comply with the requisites of the competitive bidding statutes would preclude the Village from recovering the cost of the repairs from the landowner. General Municipal Law &sect; 103 requires projects greater than $ 5,000 to be submitted to competitive bidding; when, as here, competitive bidding is statutorily required, and the municipality fails to follow that procedure, the contract is completely, not partially, void.  In such circumstances, a third party should not be forced to reimburse a municipality for expenditures it has advanced in connection with a void contract. The public fisc is still protected because the municipality is excused from any payment under the void contract, and, indeed, may recover any moneys already paid, even if performance under the contract has been completed and return of the material and labor is impossible.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court consolidated two cases for review that involved taxpayers who urged their due process rights were violated because defendant counties failed to inform them that tax liens against their properties would not be sold at a competitive bidding, and that plaintiffs would not receive any surplus from the ultimate proceeds. The judgments appealed from were entered in the Supreme Courts of Suffolk and Sullivan Counties (New York).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that real property tax schemes that required notice to taxpayers of taxes due, notice of delinquent taxes, notice of a tax lien sale, a tax sale without competitive bidding, a redemption period and notice of impending expiration of the redemption period before resale of the property, and retention of surplus proceeds by the county, did not deprive taxpayers of property without due process of law or constitute a taking without just compensation. The court found that taxpayers' failure to inform themselves of the relevant competitive bidding and forfeiture statutes, rather than the challenged statutory provisions, resulted in the consequences complained of.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Tax Liens, Tax Sales and Tax Titles -- Sale without Competitive Bidding -- Retention of Surplus of Resale by County -- Due Process -- Taking without Just Compensation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A real property tax scheme which requires notice to a taxpayer of taxes due, notice of delinquent taxes, notice of a tax lien sale, a tax sale without competitive bidding, a redemption period and notice of the impending expiration of the redemption period before the resale of the property at public auction and retention of any surplus by the county, does not deprive a taxpayer of property without due process of law or constitute a taking without just compensation.  Once taxpayers are provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard on the adjudicative facts concerning the valuation of properties subject to tax, as was done here, they have received all the process that is due.  There is no unfairness, much less a deprivation of due process, in the county's retention of any surplus. A three-year redemption period, as set forth in the challenged statutes, gives sufficient opportunity for a taxpayer to reclaim the property.  There is no constitutional prohibition against a full forfeiture which has already occurred upon the taxpayer's failure to redeem the property before it has been resold.  Finally, there is no constitutional requirement that tax liens be sold only through competitive bidding. </SPAN></P>

The town contended that single-family zoning was a reasonable legislative choice and did not conflict with the human rights laws. The homeowners contended that the ordinance was invalid on its face, arbitrary, unreasonable, and did not accomplish a legitimate public purpose. The court held that the homeowners proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The ordinance, by limiting occupancy of single-family homes to persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption or to only two unrelated persons of a certain age, excluded many households who posed no threat to the goal of preserving the character of the traditional single-family neighborhood.

Manifestly, restricting occupancy of single-family housing based generally on the biological or legal relationships between its inhabitants bears no reasonable relationship to the legitimate governmental purposes in enacting this ordinance of reducing parking and traffic problems, controlling population density and preventing noise and disturbance. Further, this ordinance, by limiting occupancy of single-family homes to persons related by blood, marriage or adoption or to only two unrelated persons of a certain age, excludes many households who pose no threat to the legitimate governmental objective of preserving the character of the traditional single-family neighborhood, and thus fails the rational relationship test.  Although article I, &sect; 1 (a) of the ordinance, which defines family as &quot;[any] number of persons, related by blood, marriage, or legal adoption&quot;, is not per se unconstitutional, provided the ordinance contains an alternative definition of family as any number of unrelated persons living together who meet the indicia for the functional equivalent of a traditional family; however, because the only alternative definition contained in this ordinance (art I, &sect; 1 [b]) is more restrictive, both as to the number of unrelated persons and their ages, than is constitutionally permissible, the entire definition of family contained in the ordinance violates our State constitutional guarantee that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought review from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which unanimously confirmed respondent city's decision to assess a general corporation tax deficiency against the taxpayer for the years 1977, 1978, and 1979.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer argued that the city's tax was unconstitutional because it conflicted with 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 742, renumbered 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3124, which provided that all stocks, bonds, treasury notes, and other obligations of the United States should be exempt from taxation by state or municipal or local authority. The taxpayer contended that the city's tax was a franchise tax that impermissibly discriminated against obligations of the United States by excluding federal obligations from the denominator of the investment allocation percentage, while including obligations of other states. The court agreed and reversed the judgment. Section 742 was established to prevent taxes which diminished the market value or the investment attractiveness of obligations issued by the United States in an effort to secure necessary credit, by providing an exemption for federal obligations. A franchise tax was constitutional so long as it remained the same whatever the character of the corporate assets might be. However, a state tax that imposed a greater burden on holders of federal property than on holders of similar state property impermissibly discriminated against federal obligations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of the city, with costs, and granted the taxpayer's petition.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By rendering investments in obligations of the Federal Government less attractive than other investments, in the calculation of taxes due under New York City's General Corporation Tax (Administrative Code of City of New York &sect; R46-3.0 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.), the City tax discriminates against Federal obligations within the meaning of the Federal statute permitting only nondiscriminatory franchise taxes to be levied on United States obligations (31 USC &sect; 742 [renum &sect; 3124]), and therefore violates the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution (US Const, art VI, cl 2); the City tax law places a greater burden on taxpayers holding Federal obligations, thus making them less attractive investments in two ways, (1) the law discriminates in favor of the obligations of the other 49 States, and (2) the law discriminates in favor of corporate obligations; excluding Federal obligations from the denominator of the fraction used to determine a taxpayer's investment allocation percentage (Administrative Code &sect; R46-4.0 [3] [b]), while including obligations of other States, effectively places a greater tax on the former than on the latter; the 18% rule compounds the problem, by disadvantaging taxpayers who invest 82% or more of the value of their portfolios in obligations other than those of corporations with low business allocation percentages, including Federal obligations;  that the disparities may be rational for due process or equal protection purposes is not relevant under former section 742; it is also beside the point that the tax scheme does not discriminate in favor of obligations of the State of New York.  </SPAN></P>

The regulation was not an unauthorized extension of article 7-C of the N.Y. Mult. Dwell.

The court read the statutes and regulation in pari materia because each involved the same subject and there was no legislative purpose clearly shown, in support of its conclusion. Therefore, the fact that article 7-C of N.Y. Mult. Dwell.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant adoptive parents sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which vacated an order of the family court granting appellants' petition for adoption of respondent biological parents' infant and remitted the matter to the family court for entry of an order providing for the transfer of the infant's custody from appellants to respondents as expeditiously as possible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After respondent biological parents consented to the adoption of their infant by appellant adoptive parents, respondents attempted to revoke the consent they had given three months earlier and regain custody of the child. The family court determined that respondents had no right to revoke and that the baby's best interests would be served by adoption by appellants. The appellate division reversed, and on appeal, the court reversed the appellate court. The court held that respondents were afforded proper notice of the operation and effect of N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 115-b, which provided a 30-day period for revocation from the date respondents were notified of the commencement of the adoption proceeding. Respondents had no standing to complain about the statute's legality because they suffered no injury, notwithstanding their receipt of notice of the scheduled adoption proceeding a month after it had been commenced and the fact that the extrajudicial consent they had signed failed to advise them of the consequences of revocation. Further, respondents failed to establish fraud, duress, or coercion in the execution of the consent, as required to avoid the application of &sect; 115-b.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the appellate division and granted appellant adoptive parents' petition for adoption because respondent biological parents, having failed to make any effort to revoke within 30 days of notification of the adoption proceeding, were bound by their consent to the adoption.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Domestic Relations Law &sect; 115-b requires that extrajudicial consents to private-placement adoptions notify the biological parents of the limited nature of their right of revocation, and their 30-day revocation period runs from notice to them of the commencement of an adoption proceeding. Accordingly, respondent natural parents' &quot;irrevocable consent&quot; to adoption must be honored and the petition for adoption granted where, although respondents did not receive notice of the adoption proceeding until a month after it had been commenced, and although the extrajudicial consent respondents signed failed to advise them of the consequences of a timely revocation, respondents suffered no injury as a result of either omission; respondents were notified by Family Court on January 23, 1984 that there would be a preliminary hearing in connection with the adoption; respondents' right to revoke therefore must be measured from that date, and it ended 30 days later, on February 23, 1984; respondents' revocation on February 29, 1984 was plainly untimely and, thus, having failed to revoke their consent within the 30-day statutory period, respondents cannot complain of a failure to advise them of what the consequences of a timely revocation would have been; further, the language contained in the judicial and extrajudicial consent to adoption forms signed by respondents in and of itself was not misleading, complied with the statute, and accurately conveyed the time limitation placed on revocation by Domestic Relations Law &sect; 115-b (1) (d) (i); moreover, neither emotional distress nor mistake on respondents' part is a ground for vitiating consent under Domestic Relations Law &sect; 115-b (4).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a state committee chairman (chairman), and defendants, the Governor of New York and a task force (collectively Governor), cross-appealed from the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, Third Judicial Department (New York), which reversed an order declaring an executive order unconstitutional, declared it constitutional, and enjoined the Governor from providing receptacles for completed voter registration forms.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Governor issued an executive order that established a voter registration program and the task force. The chairman contended that the executive order violated the doctrine of separation of powers and N.Y. Const. art II, &sect; 8 because it infringed upon the mandate that the legislature provide by law for systems of registration under N.Y. Const. art. II, &sect; 6. The Governor challenged the injunction with respect to the receptacles. The court held that the executive order did not nullify legislative action. The program was not registering anyone to vote in contravention of any statute or constitutional delegation of authority but was merely facilitating the distribution and filling out of forms, only the first step toward registration. The executive order, when implemented in conjunction with the injunction against providing locked receptacles, did not violate the constitutional mandate and did not implicate the constitutional requirement of bipartisan representation. The presence of the registration forms, however, in the control of state agency employees increased the potential for mischief, and the court sustained the injunction against the provision of the locked receptacles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appeals court's finding that the executive order was constitutional. The court sustained so much of the injunction as applied to the use of locked receptacles for completed voter registration forms.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Elections -- Registration -- Authority of Governor to Establish State Program for Voter Registration</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Executive Order No. 43 (9 NYCRR 4.43), which established a program of voter registration by making registration forms and assistance available at State agencies, does not violate the constitutional principle of separation of powers, since it is only when the Executive acts inconsistently with the Legislature, or usurps its prerogatives, that the doctrine is violated, and the program established by Executive Order No. 43 is not registering anyone to vote in contravention of any statute or constitutional delegation of authority, but is merely facilitating the distribution and filling out of forms, which is only the first step toward registration, and the Executive is merely implementing the policy of the Legislature in a manner which in no way treads on its prerogatives; nor does the executive order violate NY Constitution, article II, &sect; 8, since it is not a law and because the personnel who implement it do not register voters, distribute ballots or receive, record or count votes at elections. However, the provision of receptacles for completed registration forms in the offices that distribute the forms is enjoined; the presence of such forms in boxes which in some cases are in the control of agency employees too closely approaches the critical stage of delivery to the local Board of Elections, thus rendering the agency, for all intents and purposes, a &quot;branch office&quot; of the Board.  </SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court found under the express terms of the statute, the panel's recommendation was not binding upon the trier of fact and was only to be accorded such weight as the trier of fact chose to ascribe to it. Thus, it was merely a guide to the jury, and its admission into evidence did not impermissibly burden or nullify the individual's constitutional right to a meaningful jury trial. The court observed the &sect; 148-a(8) was enacted to combat the problem of increasing malpractice rates and to better equip parties to mediate a settlement. Because &sect; 148-a(8) had some fair, just, and reasonable connection to promoting the health, comfort, safety, and welfare of society, it did not violate the individual's right to due process of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following conviction of rape in the first degree and sentencing to an indeterminate term of 7 to 21 years from the trial court, which was affirmed by an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), defendant contended that the sentence was presumptively vindictive because the sentence following trial was heavier than after he entered a plea agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A heavier sentence was imposed following trial than was imposed following defendant's earlier conviction of first-degree rape based on his guilty plea. Defendant asserted that the heavier sentence imposed violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. On appeal, the court held that the heavier sentence imposed after trial was constitutionally permissible, limitation of the scope of the second Wade hearing was proper, and the in-court identification by the victim was properly allowed. No actual vindictiveness was established regarding the imposition of the heavier sentence. Once defendant's sentence based upon the plea agreement was reversed, the slate was wiped clean and the prosecution began anew. The consideration for defendant's plea agreement failed when defendant successfully appealed and went to trial and the victim was compelled to testify. Moreover, the acceptance of the plea negotiation as a legitimate process, in the course of which defendant was discouraged from asserting trial rights and forced to choose between the certainty of leniency in return for a plea or a heavier penalty if those trial rights are asserted, involved no due process violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order convicting defendant of rape in the first degree and imposition of the heavier sentence following trial because there was no violation of defendant's right to due process or to confront the witness against him, it having been stated during both sentencing proceedings that the lesser sentence following the guilty plea was imposed to spare the victim the necessity of recounting the experience at a public trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Imposition of Heavier Sentence Following Retrial -- Due Process</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. That a heavier sentence is imposed following trial than was imposed following defendant's earlier conviction, thereafter reversed, of first degree rape based on his guilty plea, involves no violation of defendant's right to due process (US Const 14th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 6), it having been stated during both sentencing proceedings that the lesser sentence following the guilty plea was imposed to spare the victim the necessity of recounting the experience at a public trial; having accepted the exercise of discretion to lower the original sentence in return for a plea in order to protect the victim, the defendant should not be heard to complain that a higher sentence is imposed after conviction following a retrial at which, by requiring that the victim testify, he has removed from consideration the element of discretion involved.  Also, there is less likelihood of self-vindication or recrimination and the chance of improper motivation is reduced since a different judge presided over the trial and sentencing after trial than took the original plea and imposed sentence on the basis of it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Imposition of Heavier Sentence Following Retrial -- Right of Confrontation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. That a heavier sentence is imposed following trial than was imposed following defendant's earlier conviction, thereafter reversed, for first degree rape based on his guilty plea, involves no violation of defendant's right to confront the witnesses against him (US Const 6th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 6; Civil Rights Law &sect; 12), it having been stated during both sentencing proceedings that the lesser sentence following the guilty plea was imposed to spare the victim the necessity of recounting the experience at a public trial. The acceptance of plea negotiation as a legitimate process, in the course of which a defendant may be discouraged from asserting trial rights and forced to choose between certainty of leniency in return for a plea or a heavier penalty if those trial rights are asserted, involves no constitutional violation; defendant was made aware as part of the plea bargaining process that the leniency being accorded him involved foregoing both the right to trial and to confrontation of the victim; the possibility of a heavier sentence after trial following his successful appeal did not impermissibly burden his confrontation rights.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Suppression Hearing -- Retrial -- Relitigation of Issues Affirmed on Prior Appeal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The reversal of defendant's guilty plea conviction did not entitle him to relitigate the issue of suggestiveness decided against him prior to that conviction during the first preplea suppression hearing and not reversed on appeal.  CPL 710.60 (4), which calls for a hearing on a suppression motion, does not mandate reconsideration at the required hearing of issues the disposition of which was affirmed on the prior appeal; although CPL 710.40 (4) vests the trial court with discretion to reopen such a hearing on grounds previously unavailable to defendant, denial of such a motion under the circumstances of this case involves no abuse of discretion.  Moreover, the words &quot;pre-pleading status&quot; in CPL 470.55 (2), which provides that upon an appellate court reversal of a judgment based upon a guilty plea, in the absence of express appellate court direction to the contrary, the criminal action is &quot;restored to its pre-pleading status&quot;, can only be read to refer to the status of the case prior to the &quot;plea of guilty&quot;; although cases construing the predecessor section, Code of Criminal Procedure &sect; 544, permitted motions to be made on remand after appeal, none involved relitigation of an issue litigated and decided prior to reversal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Identification of Defendant -- Independent Source</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The hearing judge's finding of independent source for an in-court identification of defendant, affirmed by the Appellate Division, was based on sufficient evidence where the rape victim not only testified that she was able to get a good look at defendant's face at various times during the four hours they were together, but also testified that during the sexual assault his face was but a few inches from hers; therefore, the issue is beyond the review of the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Imposition of Greater Sentence after Retrial -- Presumption of Vindictiveness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. When a greater sentence is imposed following retrial after appeal than was imposed after the original trial, the opportunity to retaliate for the successful appeal and to deter others from similar appeals is present and the likelihood that retaliation or deterrence or both constitute the motivation for the additional time required to be served is sufficient to engage the presumption of vindictiveness in resentencing; the presumption may be overcome by evidence that the higher sentence rests upon a legitimate and reasoned basis.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff housing project, defendant sewer authority, and intervenor defendant churches cross appealed from a judgment of the Supreme Court (New York), which modified and affirmed, as modified, an order that awarded the sewer authority a sum of money on its counterclaim against the housing project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sewer authority was authorized by statute to establish a schedule of rates, rentals, or charges to be collected from all real property served by its facilities. The sewer authority had historically exempted certain real property from its ad valorem portion of assessing these rents. The housing project was not one of these properties and filed an action claiming that the sewer authority had no authority to exempt any property users of its facilities from sewer rentals. The housing project withheld payment of the ad valorem portion of its sewer rental fee. The housing project contended that the law was unconstitutional and that the sewer authority's method of assessing the ad valorem component of its sewer rents was not authorized by the statute. The court rejected the sewer authority's position and held that the law as interpreted and applied by the sewer authority was constitutional. The court found that the classification employed by the sewer authority was not a fundamental interest or suspect classification and thus, did not offend the constitution because it had some reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment to provide that the sewer authority's method of calculating sewer rents was valid and affirmed the remainder of the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Buffalo Sewer Authority -- Sewer Rents -- Constitutionality of Exemption from Ad Valorem Component</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 862 of the Laws of 1981, which amended Public Authorities Law &sect; 1180, to create a specific statutory exemption from the ad valorem component of the sewer rent assessment levied by defendant Buffalo Sewer Authority (BSA) for those properties that are exempt from real property taxation pursuant to enumerated sections of Real Property Tax Law article 4, is constitutional.  Since a &quot;fundamental interest&quot; or &quot;suspect&quot; classification is not involved in BSA's fixing of sewer rents, section 1180, as amended, and BSA's interpretation of the statute in classifying properties that are subject to or exempt from the ad valorem sewer levy are to be tested by a rational basis standard of review; the classification employed here easily meets the rational basis test since entities that are tax exempt, such as governments and charitable and religious organizations, may properly be considered less able to pay for a sewer system, especially insofar as the system redounds to the common benefit of all property rather than to one specific parcel; in addition, while all property values are enhanced by a sewer system, holders of tax-exempt properties may be in a different classification because generally they do not share the objective of commercial and residential property owners, the enjoyment of their property's market appreciation and the realization of profit thereon upon resale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Public Authorities -- Buffalo Sewer Authority -- Sewer Rents -- Exemption of Tax-Exempt Properties -- &quot;Equitable Basis&quot; Test</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. As a matter of statutory interpretation, defendant Buffalo Sewer Authority's (BSA) long practice of exempting tax-exempt properties from the ad valorem component of the sewer rent assessment authorized by Public Authorities Law &sect; 1180 is a fair and rational application of the &quot;equitable basis&quot; test provided in section 1180; while classifications fixing different rates must relate to the benefits received, here it cannot be said that governmental, charitable and religious institutions obtain the same value, in terms of over-all market appreciation, from the entire sewer system as commercial and residential property owners; nor is it irrational to exempt them from those charges designed to defray the costs of the public benefit services supplied by BSA's system.  </SPAN></P>

Penal Law &sect; 235.00. According to the appeals court, probable cause could not be determined from the title of a film or by brief descriptions of sexual activity. The appeals court held that the necessity for sufficient information was to protect against the court interposing its personal view as to what was obscene. The appeals court held that the task of the issuing magistrate was not to decide guilt or innocence but to determine in a preliminary way from the information submitted and available to him whether there was probable cause to believe that the material to be seized was obscene. The appeals court held that while a copy of the film was not required to be annexed to the affidavit, the information was lacking for the magistrate to make a determination of whether there was probable cause.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In proceedings instituted in a Village Justice Court charging defendants with six counts of obscenity in the third degree based upon their possession of allegedly obscene video cassette movies, a motion to suppress the seized films on the ground that the warrant authorizing their seizure, which was issued by Supreme Court, a superior court ( CPL 10.10 [2], [3]), was not based on probable cause, was properly entertained by the Justice Court, a local criminal court.  The Constitution provides that local courts &quot;shall have the jurisdiction prescribed by the legislature&quot; (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 17 [a]) and the Legislature has provided that when an information is pending in a local criminal court, as these informations were, a motion to suppress &quot;must be made in such court&quot; ( CPL 710.50 [1] [c]).  Moreover, Justice Court had such jurisdiction even though the warrant was issued by a Supreme Court Justice; CPL 690.05 provides that warrants shall be issued by local criminal courts, but the Supreme Court Justice was authorized to issue this warrant because at the time he did so he was exercising preliminary, not trial, jurisdiction of the local criminal court as permitted by CPL 10.10 (3) (f).  Thus, Justice Court acted properly when it reviewed his probable cause determination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The magistrate who issued the warrant authorizing the seizure of allegedly obscene films did not have sufficient information submitted and available to him to determine in a preliminary way whether there was probable cause to believe that the material to be seized was obscene within the tripartite definition of Penal Law &sect; 235.00 and, therefore, the seized films are suppressed; because the record does not indicate whether the magistrate viewed the films or questioned the investigators who did view the films, the warrant authorization must be judged solely on the allegations contained in the papers submitted to him, which consisted of affidavits executed by the investigator who viewed the films identifying the film by title, indicating the time required to view it, and describing the sexual activity shown in some of the scenes. None of the affidavits permit an inference that the scenes described are more than a catalog of offensive parts of the whole; further, the statements relied upon are conclusory and patently ambiguous and, therefore, the magistrate was required to inquire and clarify the affidavits' meaning and the record does not establish that he did so;  although the affidavits need not describe the full content of the movie, they must contain enough information to permit the issuing magistrate, applying contemporary community standards, to judge the films as a whole and determine that they are within the statutory definitions of obscenity and thus are not entitled to constitutional protection; probable cause cannot be inferred from the title of an hour and a half long film or from the description of a few scenes from it, even when the scenes described portray conduct enumerated in Penal Law &sect; 235.00 (1) (b).  </SPAN></P>

The mayor could not have used the order to enforce any laws or constitutional requirements to prohibit the discrimination because there was no legal prohibition of such discrimination.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The power of the Mayor of the City of New York to regulate the terms of city contracts (New York City Charter &sect; 8 [a]) did not give the Mayor the authority to promulgate the challenged portion of Executive Order No.  50 which prohibits employment discrimination by city contractors on the basis of &quot;sexual orientation or affectional preference&quot;.  An executive may not usurp the legislative function by enacting social policies not adopted by the Legislature, and there is no legislative enactment prohibiting employment discrimination on such a basis; an attempt by the Mayor to broaden the class of persons protected from discrimination by private employers, or to require that all employment decisions be merit-based, however commendable, is an enactment of policy which the New York City Charter leaves to the City Council; accordingly, the challenged portion of Executive Order No. 50 does not fall within the Mayor's Charter-conferred power to regulate the terms of city contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Executive Power of Mayor -- Duty to Prevent Violations of Equal Protection -- Prohibition of Employment Discrimination Based on &quot;Sexual Orientation or Affectional Preference&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The power or duty of the Mayor of the City of New York to prevent the city from engaging in or funding discriminatory conduct which violates the equal protection clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions (US Const 14th Amend; NY Const, art I, &sect; 11) did not give the Mayor the authority to promulgate the challenged portion of Executive Order No. 50 which prohibits employment discrimination by city contractors on the basis of &quot;sexual orientation or affectional preference&quot;.  In order for a court to conclude that there is &quot;State action&quot;, thus making equal protection requirements applicable, the alleged discriminatory conduct of a private employer must be fairly attributable to the State; there are no facts or circumstances pointed to by defendants or otherwise apparent which could make the city responsible for the employment decisions of the plaintiff contractors or of city contractors generally; thus, Executive Order No. 50, in prohibiting discrimination by city contractors on the basis of &quot;sexual orientation or affectional preference,&quot; is not prohibiting conduct covered by the 14th Amendment.  Moreover, the equal protection clause does not ordinarily prevent the city from contracting with private employers who discriminate on this basis, as the existence of the contract would not, by itself, make the city &quot;responsible&quot; for the private employment decisions so as to invoke constitutional protections.  </SPAN></P>

Health Law &sect; 2320 to enjoin and abate any conduct constituting lewdness, assignation, or prostitution at a bookstore. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) denied the company's motion for partial summary judgment and granted its motion for leave to appeal. The company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company operated a bookstore, which sold books and magazines of a sexually frank nature and contained coin-operated movie machines showing sexually explicit material. Lewd and illegal activities, which the company permitted, were observed in the bookstore. The company argued that the denial of partial summary judgment was improper because &sect; 2320 was intended to cover only houses of prostitution, and, hence, inapplicable. The company also argued that the order of abatement constituted prohibited prior restraint. The court held that: (1) &sect; 2320 applied to enjoin a nuisance on premises other than a house of prostitution because there was no legislative intent to restrict its application to such function; (2) &sect; 2320 did not require the state to show that the primary purpose of the bookstore was for lewdness or prostitution; (3) the prosecution was required to show a pattern of conduct sufficient to prove that the premises were employed for a proscribed use; and (4) closure constituted prior restraint because it was not essential to further the purpose of enjoining a nuisance under &sect; 2320.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the appellate court's grant of partial summary judgment for the company by dismissing the portions of the action seeking an order to permanently enjoin conduct constituting a nuisance or to close the bookstore.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nuisance -- Lewd and Illegal Behavior at Bookstore -- Injunction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Public Health Law, article 23, title II, entitled &quot;Houses of Prostitution: Injunction and Abatement&quot; is applicable to enjoin a nuisance in the form of lewd and illegal acts occurring at a bookstore which sells books and magazines of a sexually frank nature and contains several coin-operated movie machines showing sexually explicit material; Public Health Law &sect; 2320, which includes in its definition of conduct constituting a nuisance any building used for the purpose of lewdness, assignation or prostitution as well as a building in which any such conduct occurs, is unambiguously broader in reach than the title of title II and the People need not show that the &quot;primary purpose&quot; for which the building in question is being used is lewdness, assignation or prostitution. Plaintiff's allegations raise a question of fact as to the applicability of title II; the People will have to show a consistent pattern of conduct sufficient to prove that the premises are being employed for a proscribed use; the most significant factors in making this factual determination will be the frequency of the conduct, the knowledge or even encouragement by the defendant of its existence, and the extent of the benefit, direct or indirect, derived by defendant from such activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Nuisance -- Lewd and Illegal Behavior at Bookstore -- Mandatory Closure Constitutes Prior Restraint</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The mandatory closure provisions of Public Health Law, article 23, title II, which provide for the enjoining and abatement of any conduct constituting lewdness, assignation or prostitution occurring at premises, constitute an impermissible prior restraint and an infringement upon the First Amendment rights of the operator of a bookstore which sells books and magazines of a sexually frank nature and contains several coin-operated movie machines showing sexually explicit material, at which premises it is alleged that a nuisance in the form of lewd and illegal acts committed by patrons is occurring. Although a statute aimed at the abatement of a public nuisance is certainly within the police power of the State, restriction of the conduct alleged in the complaint furthers an important governmental interest, and the interest in restricting this conduct is clearly unrelated to the suppression of free expression; however, closure of defendant's bookstore is not essential to the furtherance of the purposes underlying title II, there have been no &quot;less restrictive&quot; remedial measures imposed which have failed to abate the nuisance, nor has the District Attorney demonstrated that the injunctive relief provided for in title II would be insufficient to abate the nuisance. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which granted summary judgment to appellee city and dismissed the action of the property owner to declare N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 305 and art. 19 unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A property owner brought a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 305 and art. 19, which pertained to the assessing, levying, and collection of real property taxes, claiming they deprived him of rights to due process and equal protection of the law. The trial court granted the city's motion for summary judgment, and the property owner appealed. The court affirmed the dismissal of the challenge to &sect; 305, finding that it was not impermissibly vague because judicial construction of the statute put the property owner on notice that the use of &quot;value&quot; in the statute referred to &quot;market value.&quot; The court modified the order by determining that art. 19, as applied to the property owner, violated the equal protection clause because it impermissibly created geographic classifications that resulted in unequal tax treatment of similarly situated properties. The court concluded that the property owner's non-homestead property within the city limits was being improperly taxed at a different rate than non-homestead property outside the city limits but still within the same county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order granting the city summary judgment by dismissing the constitutional challenge to the statute permitting fractional assessment of real property, but modified the order by concluding that the legislation that permitted a dual rate tax structure violated the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions by permitting similarly situated properties to be taxed unequally.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Real Property Tax -- Fractional Assessment -- Due Process of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Real Property Tax Law &sect; 305 is not void for vagueness in violation of constitutional due process notice requirements either because it permits assessments at less than full value or because it permits fractional assessments to be made without specifying a fraction; due process requires only a reasonable degree of certainty so that individuals of ordinary intelligence are not forced to guess at the meaning of statutory terms; section 305 satisfies that standard because plaintiff has notice by established judicial construction of the term &quot;value&quot; that it means &quot;market value&quot; and because, even though the statute itself does not prescribe the uniform ratio by which all property is to be assessed, proof of such ratio is readily available in any certiorari proceeding based on valuation by use of the ratio found by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment.  Moreover, plaintiff received ample, albeit constructive, notice of the value relied upon in this case when the City of Rochester reassessed all property on its rolls at the uniform rate of full value.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Real Property Tax -- Assessment -- Fractional Assessment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action challenging the real property tax imposed by the City of Rochester pursuant to the standard of assessment mandated by Real Property Tax Law &sect; 305, which provides for assessment &quot;at a uniform percentage of value (fractional assessment)&quot;, plaintiff's first cause of action, to the extent that it can be inferred to allege that the Constitution requires that all assessments must be made at full market value, must fail, because his property was assessed at full market value and because the former requirement of full value assessment was statutory, not constitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Real Property Tax -- Delegation of Legislative Authority to Tax</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Real Property Tax Law article 19 does not constitute an improper delegation of legislative authority to tax; the article does not, by its terms or otherwise, permit local assessing units to set tax rates; rather, the Legislature has delegated the authority to tax to local legislative bodies, as it may, to be exercised by them within prescribed discretionary limits; once the local legislature adopts the statute, the assessor may classify property into residential and commercial classes by partitioning them as they appeared on the previous years' assessment rolls. The decision to adopt article 19, however, and the permissible options for varying the base proportions (Real Property Tax Law &sect; 1903 [2] [b] [i], [ii]) remain matters entrusted to the local legislative body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Real Property Tax -- Assessment -- Homestead and Non-homestead Property Classes -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Disparity</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> in Tax Imposed upon Similarly Situated Properties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Local Laws, 1983, No. 6 of City of Rochester, by which the city adopted the provisions of Real Property Tax Law article 19, and article 19 itself, which permits a city or town which has undergone a revaluation of all its real property in compliance with standards imposed by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment to adopt a dual tax rate structure (Real Property Tax Law &sect; 1901 [d]; &sect; 1903), deny plaintiff equal protection of the laws under the Federal and State Constitutions because their application results in a disparity in county taxes imposed upon plaintiff's non-homestead property located in the City of Rochester and similar properties located outside the city.  The classification of properties within the City of Rochester as homestead and non-homestead and the imposition of different tax rates on each is reasonable because arguably greater services may be required for non-homestead properties within the city than for homestead properties; however, when county taxes are applied to non-homestead properties in the city and non-homestead properties which are located outside of the city, the taxes levied result in invidious discrimination between owners of similar properties in different assessing units; Monroe County taxes non-homestead property in Rochester at a higher rate than similar non-homestead properties outside of the City of Rochester simply because, under the provisions of article 19, Rochester imposes a higher share of the tax levy on non-homestead properties than do the other towns in the county.  Inasmuch as no rational demographic basis is suggested or apparent for deliberately imposing the demonstrably different tax burdens on similar properties because of their different geographic locations, the statute is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Real Property Tax -- Invalidation of Tax </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Retroactivity of Invalidation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Although Local Law, 1983, No. 6 of City of Rochester and Real Property Tax Law article 19 are invalid since their application violates the equal protection clauses of the Federal and State Constitutions by permitting non-homestead properties in the City of Rochester and like properties in other parts of Monroe County to be taxed unequally by the county, the fact remains that the City of Rochester relied upon the revenues derived from implementing the local law and would suffer an undue burden if it had to refund the taxes collected and, therefore, the invalidation of the statute will not be applied retroactively; thus, recovery of taxes previously paid pursuant to the legislation for the 1984-1985 tax year a now invalidated will not be permitted.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city and defendants, nonprotester taxpayers and protester taxpayers who favored refunds to nonprotester taxpayers, challenged the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), reversing the trial court's order and granting partial summary judgment to defendants, protester taxpayers who opposed refunds to nonprotester taxpayers, on their counterclaim in the city's class action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city initiated a class action pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 9 in order to resolve all claims against it for overpayment of taxes. The trial court certified the class action and designated several subclasses. A subclass consisting of protester taxpayers who opposed refunds to nonprotester taxpayers filed a counterclaim and a motion for partial summary judgment and to dismiss pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211(b), 3212. The trial court denied the motion. The intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court's order. The court reversed the intermediate appellate court's order and remanded the case. It held that the motion preceded joinder of issue and was untimely because the city had not replied to the counterclaim. The court reasoned that a Rule 3211(b) motion was unavailable to the protester taxpayer subclass because there had been no reply and the motion could not be used to anticipate defenses based upon the general denials of liability in the city's complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendants, representatives of a subclass of taxpayers who protested payment of taxes determined to have been illegally assessed against them by plaintiff city,  did not lack standing or authority to pursue summary judgment on their counterclaim for refunds in plaintiff's preemptive class action commenced to resolve all claims of both protesters and nonprotesters in one forum.  A class representative acts as principal to the other class members and owes them a fiduciary duty to vigorously protect their interests; that responsibility clearly encompasses the duty to act affirmatively to secure the class members' rights as well as to oppose the adverse interests asserted by others; although the order appointing defendants directed them to oppose payments to nonprotesting claimants, that did not limit their authority to make this motion.</SPAN></P>

Because plaintiff had not replied to defendants' counterclaim, their 3212 motion for summary judgment preceded joinder of issue and was untimely; a CPLR 3211 (b) motion may be addressed to a reply but that motion was not available to defendants because there had been no reply to their counterclaim and the motion could not be used to anticipate defenses based upon the general denials of liability alleged in the complaint; finally, the motion available to a party attacking a pleading who has not pleaded yet under CPLR 3211 (c), which permits the court, on notice to the parties, to treat a motion to dismiss made pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) as a motion for summary judgment before issue is joined, may not be used by a pleader such as defendants to foreclose a responsive pleading before an opponent has had a chance to answer the claim.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the holding, but modified the judgment to declare the tax law at issue did not violate either the state or federal constitutions. The court held that the legislature could establish an exemption for transfers of real property for less than $ 1 million because generally, profits increased as the amounts of gross consideration received increases. The court also held that administrative convenience and expense in the collection or measurement of the tax were alone a sufficient justification for the difference between the treatment of small incomes or small taxpayers and that meted out to others.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Gains Tax on Real Property Transfers -- Exemption of Transfers for Less Than One Million Dollars</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Tax Law article 31-B, which imposes a 10% tax on gains derived from real property transfers, does not violate the equal protection clause of either the United States Constitution (US Const 14th amend) or the New York State Constitution (NY Const,  art I, &sect; 11) by exempting transfers for less than one million dollars. The taxpayers' assertion that by exempting transfers for less than one million dollars the gains tax treats identically situated taxpayers differently on the basis of varying levels of gross receipts and the gross receipts have no rational correlation to the amount of the gain, is without merit.  Although liability for the tax imposed by article 31-B is determined by the amount of gross consideration, the actual calculation of the tax due depends entirely on the gain realized from the real property transfer; the gross consideration of one million dollars or more merely sets the parameters of the class of property subject to the tax; the tax imposed is not on the gross consideration received but rather on the gain that results when the consideration received for the transfer exceeds the original purchase price of the real property (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Tax Law &sect; 1440 [3]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Real Property Transfer Gains Tax -- Exemption of Transfers for Less Than One Million Dollars</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature may establish an exemption from Tax Law article 31-B, which imposes a tax of 10% on gains derived from the transfer of real property within the State payable by the transferor (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Tax Law &sect;&sect; 1441, 1442), for transfers in which the consideration is one million dollars or less (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Tax Law &sect; 1443 [1]), despite the inequalities that may result; so long as it taxes only net gains, it could rationally believe that &quot;generally speaking&quot; profits increase as the amount of gross consideration received increases.  Additionally, administrative convenience and expense in the collection or measurement of the tax are alone a sufficient justification for the difference between the treatment of small incomes or small taxpayers and that meted out to others; since the Legislature may exempt some taxpayers on this basis, where it draws the line is peculiarly a question for legislative decision especially in the field of taxation where, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Real Property Transfer Gains Tax -- Different Treatment of Condominium and Cooperative Developers and Subdivided Improved Realty</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The gains tax imposed on real property transfers by Tax Law article 31-B does not unconstitutionally discriminate against developers of condominiums and cooperative dwellings by requiring the aggregation of consideration in connection with the sale of condominium and cooperative dwellings for purposes of meeting the one million dollar taxing threshold, but not for the sale of subdivided parcels with improved residences.  The classification employed is rationally related to the legitimate State purpose of raising the revenues necessary to finance the State budget and provide needed government services; condominium and cooperative developments involve greater administrative cost to State government than does subdivided improved realty and, because they are more likely to occur in urban areas than subdivisions, make greater demands on needed public services; treating sales of condominium and cooperative units as separate tax transactions would entail greater administrative costs than in the case of subdivided realty, thereby reducing the net revenue produced by the tax.  In addition, the Legislature rationally could have believed that the challenged classification would further the conceivable purposes of encouraging the development of individually owned residences while at the same time discouraging the rapid conversion of scarce rental apartments to condominiums and cooperatives.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Real Property Transfer Gains Tax -- Basis of Real Property -- Original Purchase Price</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The statutory definition of &quot;original purchase price&quot; utilized in Tax Law article 31-B, which imposes a 10% tax on gains derived from real property transfers, adequately reflects the basis of the real property and will not lead to imposition of the tax when a net loss is sustained.  The statute defines &quot;gain&quot; as the difference between &quot;consideration&quot; (after deduction of brokerage fees) and the original purchase price (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Tax Law &sect; 1140 [1], [3], [5]), and the regulations promulgated to implement the statute make it clear that all customary, reasonable and necessary costs related to the acquisition and improvement of real property are included in the original purchase price so that the tax will be imposed only in the case of a net profit (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">see</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 20 NYCRR part 590).  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">By pleading guilty, a defendant forfeits his right to seek reversal of his conviction on the ground that identification testimony or evidence of prior statements is inadmissible because the prosecution failed to provide the required notice of intention to offer such evidence at trial; the prosecutor's failure to provide timely notice of intent to introduce evidence at trial does not affect the court's jurisdiction, and it does not impinge on rights of constitutional dimension. Defendant's efforts to invoke a statutory right designed to facilitate the introduction into evidence of trustworthy statements and identifications at a trial on the issue of guilt cannot be resuscitated on appeal without express statutory authorization, since, by his guilty plea, defendant has removed the issue of his factual guilt from the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, producer and importer of distilled spirits, appealed the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) confirming a determination by respondent, State Liquor Authority, that they had violated N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, New York State Liquor Authority, found that appellant, a producer and importer of distilled spirits, sold products in New York at prices in excess of its prices elsewhere, in violation of N.Y. Alco. Bev. Cont. Law &sect;101-b (3)[d]. Appellant was required to file an affirmation showing that the wholesale prices charged in New York were no higher that in other states. Appellant gave lump sum payments to state managers in other states, thereby effectively reducing the wholesale price in those states. Appellant failed to take into account the allowances granted under that program in filing its New York affirmation. Petitioner appealed, and alleged that respondent's determination was unsupported by substantial evidence, and that the New York affirmation statute burdened interstate commerce, in violation of the United States Constitution. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Appellate Division, holding that the determination was supported by substantial evidence; that petitioner had not established beyond a reasonable doubt that the affirmation requirements were on their face unconstitutional or as applied to the particular facts and circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A determination of respondent State Liquor Authority that petitioner violated the lowest-price affirmation provisions of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, by failing to take into account promotional allowances given to wholesalers outside New York in its affirmed price schedules, is supported by substantial evidence and is sustained.  The evidence considered by the Authority supported its conclusion that the allowances in practical application reduce the prices petitioner charges wholesalers; continued availability of the allowances is keyed to a wholesaler's purchases and its actual use of the credits; petitioner's wholesalers are expected to discount their prices, and in fact do so; the allowances are calculated on a per-case dollar figure, and while that figure may not correspond precisely to per-item discounts based on actual sales, projections are fixed by petitioner with the wholesaler, based on experience and other factors, the obvious purpose being to make them accurate.  Any real or apparent problem in ascertaining the precise per-item discount for purposes of the lowest-price affirmation is a difficulty built into the design of the program by petitioner itself and cannot weigh in its favor.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statutory requirement that distillers affirm that they will not sell liquor to wholesalers in New York State at a higher price than the lowest price at which the same item is being sold in any other State (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law &sect; 101-b [3]), does not contravene the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution (US Const, art I, &sect; 8).  When, as here, legitimate State objectives are credibly advanced in support of the statute, where no patent discrimination against interstate trade exists, and where there is only an incidental impact on interstate commerce, a flexible approach is employed in determining whether the State statute impermissibly burdens interstate commerce. The New York liquor-price affirmation statute was enacted to end discrimination against New York customers in the price of liquor; there was no showing that in either purpose or effect the New York statute advanced State revenue interests and discriminated against out-of-State businesses; and the impact of the New York statute on interstate commerce is slight, since the statute is nationwide in scope, is imitated by approximately 20 other States throughout the Nation and relates to a commodity where prices already are highly regulated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The affirmation statute (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law &sect; 101-b [3]), which requires that distillers affirm that they will not sell liquor to wholesalers in New York State at a price higher than the lowest price at which it is sold in any other State, does not violate the Commerce Clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8) as applied to the particular facts and circumstances of this case because of New York's unique treatment of the promotional allowances provided by petitioner distiller to its wholesalers; New York alone refuses to allow petitioner to conduct the program because the discounts are not within Alcoholic Beverage Control Law &sect; 101-b (2) (b), and of all the affirmation States New York alone treats the credits as allowances to be taken into account in preparing the affirmed price schedule.  In analyzing State statutes challenged under the Commerce Clause, the principal focus of inquiry must be the practical operation of the statute, since the validity of State laws must be judged chiefly in terms of their probable effects; it is certainly reasonable to expect that other States will recognize that the prices on petitioner's New York schedules have been adjusted, because of New York's statutory requirements, to take into account the effect of credits enjoyed by wholesalers elsewhere -- credits which the other States receiving the tangible benefits of petitioner's program apparently have already chosen not to consider in determining the affirmed price.  Thus, petitioner has failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the threatened mechanical application of liquor laws by other affirmation States will occur or that a downward price spiral would be precipitated.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both parties appealed the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which denied plaintiff employers' summary judgment motion; granted the cross motion for summary judgment by defendants, state comptroller, state commissioner of taxation and finance, and the State; and declared constitutionally valid the provisions of chapters 55 and 404 of the N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employers, insured by the state insurance fund (SIF), filed an action challenging the constitutionality of the transfer of moneys from the SIF to the state's general fund. The court held that the SIF was a state agency rather than a mutual insurance company because (1) nothing in article 6 of the N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law expressly established the SIF as a mutual insurance organization; (2) there were more dissimilarities than likenesses between the SIF and a mutual insurance company; (3) the SIF was created and existed as a state agency; and (4) the state was liable for all the SIF's liabilities. The court ruled that the transfer of the disputed moneys from the SIF to the general fund did not violate either the U.S. or New York Constitutions because (1) the policyholders had no property interest in SIF's surplus; (2) the transfer was an exercise of the state's prerogative as owner of the surplus funds; (3) the transfer was simply a pledge or earnest of the state's intention to carry out its obligations to the policyholders, if necessary; and (4) payment of the amount appropriated had to be made within the required two-year period.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Transfer of Funds from State Insurance Fund -- Property or Contractual Interest of Policyhoders in Fund Surplus -- Impairment of Contractual Obligations -- De Facto Tax</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State Insurance Fund (SIF) is a State agency for all of whose liabilities the State is responsible, rather, than a mutual insurance pool; thus, SIF policyholhers have no property or contractual interest in the surplus of the Fund, short of the actual declaration of a dividend by the Commissioners who administer the Fund.  Accordingly, section 92 (2) of chapter of the Laws of 1982, which directed SIF to transfer to the State's general fund $ 190 million by March 1, 1983, is not unconstitutional because it impairs constractual obligations in violation of article I, &sect; 10 (1) of the Federal Constitution.  Nothing in the applicable statutory provisions or in Workers' Compensation Law $ 89's direction that &quot;premiums in the state fund shall be fixed at the lowest posisible rates consistent with the maintenance of a solvent fund and of reasonable reserves and surplus&quot; rises to the level of language susceptible to no other reasonable construction than the a contract was intended.  Likewise, there being neither property nor contract interest of policyholders in surplus, the effect upon them of loss to the SIF of interest on the $ 190 million transferred cannot constitute a de facto tax on employers in violation of article III of the New York Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Transfer of Funds from State Insurance Fund -- Separation of Powers -- Improper Loan of State Credit</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. By transferring $ 190 million from the State Insurance fund to the State's general fund pursuant to chapter 55 of the Laws of 1982, the State has relieved the Funds' Commissioners of the necessity of exercising investment discretion with respect to part of the funds previously entrusted to them, but has done so in the exercise of its prerogative as owner of the surplus funds and, therefore, without infringing upon separation of powers.  Nor by doing so has the State improperly loaned its credit to itself, or created a debt to itself; rather it has simply given a pledge or earnest of its intention to carry out its obligations with respect to Fund policyholders should that become necessary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Transfer of Funds from State Insurance Fund -- Appropriation Not Required to be Expended within Two Years -- Appropriation Fixed by Reference to Other Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Chapter 55 of the Laws of 1982, which directed the State Insurance Fund (SIF) to transfer to the State's general fund $ 190 million by March 1, 1983, does not violate the provisions of article VII, &sect; 7 of the State Consititution governing appropriation bills.  Worker's Compensation Law &sect; 87-f (1), which establishes the mechanism for annual &quot;dry&quot; appropriation to the SIF of $ 190 million, itself makes no appropriation. The appropriations have been made in each year by separate act, each of which, without reference to any other law, fixes the amount appropriated and specifies the purpose to which the sum appropriated is to be applied.  That the moneys appropriated are not available for expenditure without approval of the Director of the Division of the Budget and that no expenditure may be made of the funds if the other assets of the SIF not part of reserves for claims or losses are available does no violence to the constitutional inhibition.  And payment within two years next after passage of the appropriation act is assured by the provision of section 87-f (1) that requires payment of the amount appropriated in any given fiscal year if the Governor fails to budget or the Legislature fails to appropriate such an amount for the succeeding fiscal year. Because such payment must be made on July 1 of the succeeding fiscal year, payment will be made, if al all, within the required two-year period.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Workers' Compensation -- State Insurance Fund -- Fund as State Agency</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The State Insurance Fund (SIF) is a State agency for all of whose liabilities the State is responsible, rather than a mutual insurance pool. Nothing in article 6 of the Workers' Compensation Law expressly establishes the SIF as a mutual insurance organization.  Unlike mutual insurance companies, the SIF was created and exists as a State agency within the Department of Labor (Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 76 [1]), its policyholders are not members and have no vote or say in administration; policyholders in the SIF not only have no responsibility to contribute to losses, as do some mutual insureds, but also are protected, as no other mutual insured is, from all claims predicated on employee injury even if the SIF, as a fund, were to become insolvent.  Moreover, dividends to policyholders are discretionary, not mandatory (Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 90).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Workers' Compensation -- State Insurance Fund -- Property Interest of Policyholders in Surplus</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The provisions of Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 76 (1) descriptive of the State Insurance Fund do not indicate a legislative intent that policyholders have a property interest in its surplus. The statement of what the Fund shall consist of and what expenses may be paid from it simply do not deal with what is to be done with surplus, and it is equally consistent with those descriptive provisions, when considered together with the facts that dividends are discretionary and that the State, and only the State, is responsible for payment of awards resulting from employee injury or death, either through its agency, the Fund, or from other State moneys, that such surplus as may exist after payment of discretionary dividends belongs to the State, not to policyholders. That the State has seen fit instead to assure the solvency of the Fund through the dry appropriation mechanism established by Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 87-f is not inconsistent with that conclusion; it is rather a pledge or earnest of the State's intention to carry out the obligation which it has borne since the sentence, &quot;[such] fund shall be administered * * * without liability on the part of the state beyond the amount of such fund was deleted from Workers' Compensation Law &sect; 76 (1)  in 1922.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, insurance associations, insurers, policyholders, and beneficiaries, challenged an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) that modified a trial court's order denying plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, and granting a cross-motion by respondents, state insurance officials, for summary judgment and dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state established a fund into which an employer or compensation carrier could pay the present value of future periodic benefits payable to compensation claimants. Two other funds were established to protect claimants from the insolvency of insurers. Insurance associations, along with insurers, policyholders, and beneficiaries, brought a declaratory judgment action against state insurance officials to have a law directing the transfer of moneys from the funds into a state fund. Plaintiffs and insurance officials brought motions for summary judgment. The trial court found that no real and present controversy existed and dismissed the suit. The appellate court modified the order, finding that plaintiffs had standing, but that the law was constitutional. On appeal, the court struck the declaration and dismissed the case. The court ruled that a justiciable controversy required plaintiffs to have an interest sufficient to constitute standing. Further, the controversy was required to involve present, rather than hypothetical, contingent, or remote prejudice to plaintiffs. Because the controversies were not ripe for determination, a declaratory judgment could not be rendered.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Justiciable Controversy -- Present Prejudice to Plaintiffs -- Declaratory Judgments -- Constitutionality of Transfer of Moneys Into State's General Fund</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The &quot;justiciable controversy&quot; upon which a declaratory judgment may be rendered requires not only that the plaintiffs in such an action have an interest sufficient to constitute standing to maintain the action but also that the controversy involve present, rather than hypothetical, contingent or remote, prejudice to plaintiffs.  Thus, in an action to obtain judgment declaring unconstitutional section 92 of chapter 55 of the Laws of 1982, insofar as it directs transfer into the State's general fund of $ 50 million from the Aggregate Trust Fund (ATF), $ 67 million from the Stock Workers' Compensation Security Fund (SWCF) and $ 87 million from the Property and Liability Insurance Security Fund (PLIS) and enjoining such transfers or requiring return of the funds if transferred, the declaration that chapter 55 was constitutional is stricken and the complaint dismissed.  That the balance in each of the funds has been reduced by the transfers directed by section 92 creates no risk that plaintiffs paid from the ATF will not be paid or the plaintiff interested in the other two funds will be left unprotected by insolvency of a carrier in view of the appropriations made by sections 84, 88 and 90 of chapter 55 and by chapter 404.  The possibility that a subsequent Legislature may omit the required appropriation for a given year and repeal both the prior year's appropriation and the provisions of chapter 55 that annual appropriations be made, is a future event beyond the control of the parties to the action which may never occur and, thus, beyond the reach of a declaratory judgment. Moreover, the possibility that because the SWCF and PLIS will, as a result of the transfers, be earning less interest, plaintiffs may be required to contribute additional moneys to those funds is nothing more than speculation in light of the history of the funds.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Relief to Nonappealing Party -- Declaratory Judgment Action -- Nonjusticiable Controversy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. On an appeal by plaintiffs from an Appellate Division order, which declared chapter 55 of the Laws of 1982 constitutional, the Court of Appeals struck the declaration of constitutionality and dismissed the complaint, despite the fact that defendants, Commissioner of Taxation and Finance and Superintendent of Insurance, were nonappealing parties, since the relief granted is incidental to the restraint upon the court against rendering an advisory determination and, having concluded that the controversy is nonjusticiable, the court cannot allow the declaration to stand.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judges appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which granted the cross motion of respondent state officials to dismiss and reversed the judgment of the trial court that the state constitution's mandatory retirement provisions for judges violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judges, nearing mandatory retirement age, brought suit to declare N.Y. Const. art. VI, &sect; 25(b) and N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 23, which mandated mandatory retirement for some judges, unconstitutional under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the federal constitution. The trial court granted the motion for a preliminary injunction, denied respondents state officials' motion to dismiss, enjoined state officials from retiring the judges, and directed that state officials retain the judges in their capacities. The appellate court reversed the decision of the trial court and granted state officials' cross motion to dismiss the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the appellate court on the grounds that the mandatory retirement provisions were subject to the rational basis standard of review for equal protection, that mandatory retirement manifestly had a rational basis, and that equal protection did not invalidate the provisions even where other provisions permitted other judges to be certified beyond retirement age. Due process also was not violated because due process and equal protection irrebuttable presumptions were co-extensive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified and affirmed the order of the appellate court, finding that the state statutes that required plaintiff judges to retire were constitutional under both the equal protection and due process clauses of the federal constitution. The court determined that the statute was subject to a rational basis equal protection standard of review and that the age limit did have a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Disqualification -- &quot;Rule of Necessity&quot;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The members of the Court of Appeals are not required to recuse themselves from participating in an appeal, taken as of right, challenging the State constitutional and statutory requirements that certain Judges of the State retire at age 70, even though they may be affected by the outcome of the appeal; inasmuch as the Court of Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction under the State Constitution to hear this appeal and no other judicial body exists to which this appeal could be referred for disposition, the present members of the court are required to hear and dispose of it under the Rule of Necessity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Role of Judiciary -- Wisdom of State Constitutional and Statutory Provisions Mandating Retirement of Certain Judges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It is not within the province of the judiciary to balance the wisdom of a lawfully implemented public policy against the hardship or illogic it may be said to impose.  This is especially true in the instant case where the policy at issue, expressed in a constitutional provision mandating that certain Judges of the State retire at age 70 (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25, subd b), directly manifests the will of the electorate of the State of New York.  The Court of Appeals is fully cognizant of the arguments that can be made against the wisdom of the challenged mandatory retirement provisions (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25, subd b; Judiciary Law, &sect; 23); however, for the repeal of such provisions, appeal lies to the ballot and to the legislative processes of democratic government, not to the courts, and this constitutes the very core of the democratic process which, under law, proscribes only unconstitutional action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Mandatory Retirement -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Suspect Class -- Fundamental Right -- Mandatory Retirement of Certain Judges at Age 70</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Judges who have attained the age of 70 do not constitute a suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis; nor do the constitutional and statutory age restrictions that require certain Judges of the State to retire at age 70 (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25, subd b; Judiciary Law, &sect; 23) impermissibly interfere with the exercise of a fundamental right. Thus, said constitutional and statutory provisions challenged by plaintiffs are not to be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny, but, rather, to a rational basis standard of review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Mandatory Retirement -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Rational Basis -- Mandatory Retirement of Certain Judges at Age 70</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Pursuant to traditional rational basis analysis, a legislative enactment will pass constitutional muster if the governmental classification is based upon some conceivable and legitimate State interest.  The mandatory retirement age limitation for State Judges (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25, subd b; Judiciary Law, &sect; 23) is rationally related to the promotion of several State interests including the advancement of general considerations of judicial efficiency, significant reasons of fiscal concern and the proper administration of the courts.  Thus, the challenged statutory and constitutional provisions mandating retirement for Judges and Justices at the end of the year in which age 70 is reached manifestly have a rational basis, and do not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Mandatory Retirement -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Mandatory Retirement of Certain Judges at Age 70 -- Certification of Certain Judges</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> for Service until Age 76</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The State constitutional and statutory provisions which mandate that certain Judges of the State retire at age 70 (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25, subd b; Judiciary Law, &sect; 23) do not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution upon the ground that an associated provision permits Justices of the Supreme Court and Judges of the Court of Appeals to receive certification for further judicial service until the age of 76, in contrast to those members of the judiciary who serve upon the Civil Court, Criminal Court, Family Court, County Court, Surrogate's Court and Court of Claims, none of whom may be so certified.  Due to the complexity and diversity of the judicial grist of the Supreme Court (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 7), certification of Supreme Court Justices and Court of Appeals Judges for service in the Supreme Court is warranted to retain Judges with experience and to insure an adequate supply of judicial personnel to meet the press of Supreme Court business.  The complexity of Supreme Court matters may rationally be deemed to require greater experience and manpower than are necessary in other courts.  Where,  as here, significant reasons of fiscal concern and the proper administration of the courts exist, or could conceivably exist, to justify distinctions between judicial offices, the lack of mathematical symmetry within the unified court system shall be disregarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Mandatory Retirement -- Due Process of Law -- Doctrine of Irrebuttable Presumptions -- Mandatory Retirement of Certain Judges at Age 70</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Plaintiffs' claim that the State constitutional and statutory provisions which require that certain Judges of the State retire at age 70 (NY Const, art VI, &sect; 25, subd b; Judiciary Law, &sect; 23) violate the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, by creating an irrebuttable presumption that Judges over the age of 70 are physically or mentally incapable, is without merit.  The due process doctrine of irrebuttable presumptions is coextensive with the equal protection clause, and equal protection analysis demonstrates a rational basis for the age limitation upon judicial tenure.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city comptroller and others adopted the findings, report, and recommendation of the hearing officer that petitioner electrical contractor had failed to pay the prevailing rage of wages to and to provide certain prevailing supplements to some employees, in violation of N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 220. The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York) affirmed. The electrical contractor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 220(3) required contractors on public projects to pay employees supplemental benefits in accordance with the prevailing practices in the same trade. The electrical contractor paid employees cash in lieu of some of the specific benefits provided under the prevailing practices for electrical workers. Nothing in &sect; 220 expressly prohibited an employer from providing the prevailing supplements either totally or partially by payments in cash. The court held that the electrical contractor's payment of cash in lieu of specific benefits was permissible under the statute and that the city comptroller's interpretation of &sect; 220 was arbitrary and irrational. Supplements could also be any payments which were not wages such as life insurance, health, disability, or vacation benefits, or holiday pay. The court also based such decision on a review of the legislative history, which reflected that &sect; 220 was added to the statute only to address concerns about equalizing contractors' minimum labor costs. Such apparent purpose could be fulfilled when a contractor paid in cash, totally or partially, the cost of prevailing supplemental benefits to employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate division, with costs, annulled the determination of respondent Comptroller of the City of New York, and remitted the matter remitted to the appellate division for determination of the issue not passed upon by that court with respect to the New York City Housing Authority.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor -- Hours and Wages -- Employees Engaged in Public Works Projects -- Prevailing Supplemental Fringe Benefits -- Cash Equivalent of Cost -- Combination of Benefits and Cash Equal to Cost</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Under subdivision 3 of section 220 of the Labor Law, supplemental fringe benefits must be provided to employees engaged in public works projects &quot;in accordance with the prevailing practices in the same trade or occupation in the locality within the state&quot; where the public work is located.  This requirement will be fulfilled when employees are supplied with the cash equivalent of the cost of obtaining the prevailing benefits or by providing an equivalent benefits plan, or by a combination of benefits and cash equal to the cost of the prevailing benefits.  The apparent purpose of the statutory provision is to equalize contractors' minimum labor costs; the legislative history of section 220 does not disclose any concern to protect workers from their possible failure to put their additional cash towards a benefit plan.  Thus, this provision should not be interpreted to require that the employer maintain or contribute directly to a benefits plan equivalent in kind to the prevailing one in order to comply with the statute.  Accordingly, the determination of the respondent Comptroller of the City of New York that petitioner had violated subdivision 3 of section 220 of the Labor Law by not providing its laborers and electricians with the prevailing supplemental benefits as set forth in respondent's benefits schedule or with an equivalent benefits plan, cannot be sustained; respondent evaluated petitioner's compliance with the statute according to the erroneous standard that no cash payments could be made to employees as a means of providing the prevailing supplements.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State sought review of the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which modified the judgment of the lower court and determined that respondent physician's action to recover certain money had and received by the state hospital for the physician's medical services did not attempt to circumvent the provisions of N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged the appellate court's order, which modified the lower court's judgment and determined that the physician's action to recover money had and received by the state hospital for the physician's medical services did not attempt to circumvent the provisions of N.Y. Fin. Law &sect; 112. The appellate court believed that the state hospital was merely acting as a conduit in receiving Medicare funds representing compensation for the physician's services and that the funds belonged to the physician. The court reversed the order of the appellate court and held that the State had not received, nor was it holding, sums of money to which the physician was entitled any more than any of the several physicians or therapists that were entitled to the itemized sums listed on the hospital's bill for various services that they supplied to in-patients and which, in the aggregate, constituted the hospital's total charge. Inasmuch as the physician could not establish that the State was wrongfully withholding sums from him to which he was entitled under &sect; 112, he failed to state a cause of action for money had and received.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Claim against State -- Court of Claims -- Jurisdiction to Entertain Action for Money Had and Received</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 2 of section 9 of the Court of Claims Act gives that court jurisdiction to determine claims for &quot;breach of contract, express or implied&quot;.  The Court of Claims has jurisdiction to adjudicate claimant's claim for money had and received, therefore, because it states a legal cause of action for money damages founded upon an implied in law contract.  The action is not barred by section 112 of the State Finance Law because claimant is not seeking to enforce an agreement; he is seeking to recover funds from the State which he alleges belong to him and which the State is wrongfully withholding from him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">State -- Claim against State -- Action for Money Had and Received -- Entitlement of Physician</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> to Medicare Funds Paid to Downstate College of Medicine</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Claimant physician, who performed salaried services in Downstate College of Medicine's kidney transplant program, has not stated a right to recover in his action against the State for money had and received predicated on a claim that he is entitled to further compensation equalling $ 290,000 of the Medicare funds paid by the Federal Government to Downstate for patients of the kidney transplant program, and that he has been wrongfully deprived of the money.  Claimant's claim concerns benefits paid for hospital services under the provisions of part A of the Medicare program (US Code, tit 42, &sect;&sect; 1395c-1395i); physicians and therapists are not entitled to payment under part A because they are not providers, i.e., &quot;a hospital, skilled nursing facility * * * or home health agency&quot; (US Code, tit 42, &sect; 1395x, subd [u]).  Payment for staff physicians' services are matters of private contract between the provider and the physician; insofar as the Medicare statute refers to charges made by the provider which may include reasonable physician's services, it states a formula for computing the provider's charges, it does not set aside fees which the physician is entitled to receive as a matter of law.  Thus, the State has not received nor is it holding sums of money to which claimant is entitled; inasmuch as claimant cannot establish that the State is wrongfully withholding sums from him to which he is entitled under the Federal statute, he has failed to state a cause of action for money had and received.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York) affirming his conviction for rape and sodomy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, while living separate from his wife and after a temporary order of protection had been issued to his wife, forced her to have intercourse and perform fellatio on him. He appealed his convictions of rape under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.35 and sodomy under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 130.50 on the basis of his being married to his wife at the time and on equal protection grounds. The court affirmed, striking down the marital exemptions to the rape and sodomy statutes as having no rational basis. The court determined that the equal protection argument required the court to either eliminate the statutes or to make the statutes gender neutral. The court determined that making the statutes gender neutral would have addressed the equal protection concerns and would have been a better result than declaring the statutes a nullity because of the effect such a declaration would have had on public safety.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions for rape and sodomy were affirmed.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Rape -- Sodomy -- Marital Exemption -- Gender Exemption -- Remedy for Constitutionally Defective </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. When a statute is constitutionally defective because of underinclusion, a court may either strike the statute, and thus make it applicable to nobody, or extend the coverage of the statute to those formerly excluded; in making such a decision the court must discern what course the Legislature would have chosen to follow if it had foreseen the court's conclusions as to underinclusiveness.  Thus, the statutes for rape in the first degree and sodomy in the first degree having been found to be unconstitutionally underinclusive, the marital exemption is stricken from sections 130.35 and 130.50 of the Penal Law and the gender exemption from section 130.35 of the Penal Law, so that it is now the law of this State that any person who engages in sexual intercourse or deviate sexual intercourse with any other person by forcible compulsion is guilty of either rape in the first degree or sodomy in the first degree.  Statutes prohibiting forcible sexual assaults are of the utmost importance, and to declare such statutes a nullity would have a disastrous effect on the public interest and safety; the inevitable conclusion is that the Legislature would prefer to eliminate the exemptions and thereby preserve the statutes.  Because the statutes under which defendant was convicted of rape in the first degree and sodomy in the first degree are not being struck down, his conviction is affirmed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Rape -- Sodomy -- Marital Exemption -- Parties Living Apart Pursuant to Court Order</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A defendant who, while living apart from his wife pursuant to a Family Court order of protection, forcibly raped and sodomized her, may be prosecuted for either crime since he was properly found to have been statutorily &quot;not married&quot; to his wife at the time of the rape and sodomy and, thus, he did not come within the &quot;marital exemption&quot; to rape and sodomy. The subject order of protection falls squarely within the definition of &quot;not married&quot; which includes those cases where the husband and wife were living apart pursuant to a court order &quot;which by its terms or in its effect requires such living apart&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 130.00, subd 4); the plain language of the statute indicates that an order of protection is within the meaning of an order &quot;which by its terms or in its effect requires [the spouses to live] apart&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Standing -- Husband Convicted of Rape and Sodomy of Wife</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Where defendant was convicted of rape in the first degree and sodomy in the first degree, based upon the forcible rape and sodomy of his wife, while living apart from her pursuant to a Family Court order of protection, his constitutional challenges to the rape and sodomy statutes premised on his being considered &quot;not married&quot; to his wife, are properly before the court.  Defendant's claim is that both statutes violate equal protection because they are underinclusive classifications which burden him, but not others similarly situated.  A litigant has standing to raise this claim even though he does not contend that under no circumstances could the burden of the statute be imposed upon him; this rule of standing applies as well to a defendant in a criminal prosecution who, while conceding that it is within the power of a State to make criminal the behavior covered by a statute, asserts that the statute he is prosecuted under violates equal protection because it burdens him but not others.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Rape -- Sodomy -- Marital Exemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The &quot;marital exemption&quot; to sections 130.35 and 130.50 of the Penal Law under which a married man ordinarily cannot be convicted of forcibly raping or sodomizing his wife, lacks a rational basis for distinguishing between marital rape and nonmarital rape and, therefore, violates the equal protection clauses of both the Federal and State Constitutions (US Const, 14th Amdt, &sect; 1; NY Const, art I, &sect; 11).  The various rationales which have been asserted in defense of the exemption are either based upon archaic notions about the consent and property rights incident to marriage or are simply unable to withstand even the slightest scrutiny.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Exemption of Females from Criminal Liability for Forcible Rape -- Gender Exemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.  Section 130.35 of the Penal Law violates equal protection because it applies to males who forcibly rape females but exempts females from criminal liability for forcible rape of males. To meet their burden of showing that a gender-based law is substantially related to an important governmental objective the People must set forth an &quot;exceedingly persuasive justification&quot; for the classification which requires, among other things, a showing that the gender-based law serves the governmental objective better than would a gender-neutral law.  The fact that the act of a female forcibly raping a male may be a difficult or rare occurrence does not mean that the gender exemption satisfies the constitutional test; a gender-neutral law would indisputably better serve, even if only marginally, the objective of deterring and punishing forcible sexual assaults. The only persons &quot;benefitted&quot; by the gender exemption are females who forcibly rape males; a gender-based classification which, as compared to a gender-neutral one, generates additional benefits only for those it has no reason to prefer cannot survive equal protection scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals decision to retain the statutes prohibiting rape in the first degree and sodomy in the first degree, while striking the marital exemption from sections 130.35 and 130.50 of the Penal Law and the gender exemption from section 130.35 of the Penal Law, and thereby affirm defendant's conviction of rape in the first degree and sodomy in the first degree, arising out of the forcible rape and sodomy of his wife while living apart from her pursuant to a Family Court order of protection, does not deny him due process of the law.  Defendant did not come within any of the exemptions which have been stricken, and thus his conduct was covered by the statutes as they existed at the time of his attack on his wife.  Neither can it be said that by the affirmance of his conviction that defendant is deprived of a constitutionally protected right to equal protection; for purposes of choosing the proper remedy for the underinclusiveness of the rape and sodomy statutes, the defendant is simply not similarly situated to those persons who were not within the scope of the statutes as they existed prior to the court's decision.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State sought review of an order of a Court of Appeals (New York), in favor of respondent Town, which reversed a judgment of the trial court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State passed legislation to protect the ground water by limiting the Town's ability to utilize landfills for waste disposal. The Town contended that N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 27-0704 violated of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(b)(2), the home rule provisions of the State Constitution. The court held that the trial court erred when it held N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 27-0704 conflicted with the home rule provisions of the constitution because N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3(a)(3) declared that nothing in the home rule provisions impaired the Legislature in relation to matters other than the property, affairs, or government of the Town. The court held that although N.Y. Envtl. Conserv. Law &sect; 27-0704 was a special law that affected the Town's property, its purpose was the protection of the sole aquifer for Nassau, Suffolk, and part of Queens from pollution, which was a matter of State concern. Therefore, it was within the power of the Legislature under N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 3(a)(3) to enact N.Y. Envtl. Conserv.

Although ECL 27-0704, which limits disposal of solid waste by landfill in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, is a special law which affects town property (the continued use of existing landfills and the use of presently owned town property for new landfills), its purpose is the protection of the sole source aquifer for Nassau, Suffolk and part of Queens from pollution, a matter of State concern.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In an action to declare unconstitutional chapter 846 of the Laws of 1980, which conferred permanent competitive class status on certain provisional employees of the Unified Court System in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, an order of the Appellate Division, which affirmed an order declaring chapter 846 constitutional, should be affirmed for the reasons stated in the opinions at Special Term and the Appellate Division (116 Misc 2d 1, affd 98 AD2d 395). The Legislature's enactment of chapter 846 occurred in the aftermath of the reorganization of the State court system and was parallel with similar legislation applicable, State-wide, to other judicial districts; in view of this particular situation and the express finding by the Legislature that the normal competitive procedures would greatly disrupt the functioning of the court system, the statute cannot be said to offend the constitutional mandate for competitive examinations (NY Const, art V, &sect; 6).  </SPAN></P>

While recognizing that the Legislature was accorded broad latitude in the establishment of tax classifications and that a discriminatory tax classification would pass constitutional muster if any conceivable state of facts supported the classification, a statute should nevertheless be declared unconstitutional if the difference in treatment constituted invidious discrimination or was palpably arbitrary. The disparate treatment of similarly situated veterans resulting from the classification created by N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 458(5) lacked a rational basis.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Exemptions -- Veterans' Exemption</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section 458 (subd 5) of the Real Property Tax Law, which provides in paragraph (a) for a mandatory proportionate increase (or decrease) in the veterans' exemption if a local taxing jurisdiction's change in the manner of assessing real property was caused by court-ordered full value assessment, and in paragraph (b) that the local taxing jurisdiction had the option of providing by local law for such a proportionate increase (or decrease) in the veterans' exemption where the change in the manner of assessing was caused by other than court-ordered full value assessment, is unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clauses of the New York Constitution and the United States Constitution, since the disparate treatment of similarly situated veterans resulting from the classification created by the statute lacks a rational basis. Subdivision 5 of section 458 must be invalidated in its totality since paragraphs (a) and (b) together constitute a single expression of legislative policy regarding the increase of veterans' real property tax exemptions; the unity of purpose which exists between paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) precludes the severance of paragraph (b) from the statute so as to grant all veterans, irrespective of local policy preferences, mandatory increases in real property exemptions. The policy decision to grant or deny increases in veterans' real property tax exemptions properly rests within the discretion of the local and State Legislatures.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant correctional facility appealed an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Fourth Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment declaring that performance of a pat frisk by a female officer violated the religious rights of respondent, a male, Muslim inmate, and ordered that any reference to reports relating to the incident be expunged from the inmate's institutional records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The male prison inmate, who was Muslim, was selected along with two or three other inmates at random for a pat frisk. The inmate objected to the female officer who approached him to conduct the frisk. The inmate expressed his concern to a sergeant, and was written up in a misbehavior report. The inmate sought an order, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, declaring that Directive 4910 of the Department of Correctional Services, which governed frisks of inmates, was unconstitutional. He also sought expungement from his record the write-up of his refusal to submit to the frisk. The trial court found that a pat frisk conducted by a female officer involved sufficient physical contact to violate a male Muslim's religious beliefs, which prohibit physical contact between the sexes outside of marriage. The trial court held that where searches were carried out as a routine precaution or were conducted at random, male correction officers were to be used to pat frisk Muslims. The court agreed with the trial court, but held that it was error for the trial court to have ordered that references to the incident be expunged from the inmate's institutional records.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the order by eliminating the expunging of the inmate's institutional record and, as so modified, affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- Freedom of Worship -- Pat Frisk of Male Muslim Inmate by Female Correction Officer</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Under section 3 of article I of the New York Constitution and section 610 of the Correction Law, it would have been a violation of the right of a Muslim inmate to free exercise of his religious beliefs, in the limited circumstances of this case, for him to have been subjected to a random pat frisk performed by a correction officer of the opposite sex; this intrusion on the prisoner's religious beliefs would not have been justified here by the State's interests in maintaining prison security or in providing equal opportunity for women to serve as prison guards. It was not established that legitimate security interests call for the use of female prison guards to perform random pat frisks of male Muslim inmates in violation of the latters' religious beliefs; when petitioner, a male Muslim inmate, was approached by the female correction officer for a random pat frisk there were other male officers in the vicinity who could have performed the search, and the delay required to respond to a Muslim's objection to a pat frisk by an officer of the opposite sex would be minimal.  Nor was it shown that the State's interest in providing equal employment opportunity to women justified a pat frisk of petitioner by the female correction officer; any one correction officer does not have the absolute right to pat frisk any single inmate of his or her selection; accommodating the religious beliefs of Muslim inmates in this instance could be attained with only a minimal impact on job assignments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- Refusal of Inmate to Carry Out Illegal Order of Correction Officer -- Expunging Institutional Records</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. It was error to order references to an incident involving a refusal by petitioner, a male Muslim inmate, to submit to a random pat frisk by a female correction officer, expunged from the inmate's institutional records following the court's determination that such pat frisk would have violated petitioner's right under New York law to the free exercise of his religious beliefs.  In view of the characteristics of the correctional system and the compelling interests of the State in the preservation of security and order within correctional facilities, the recognition and enforcement even of constitutional rights may have to await resolution in administrative or judicial proceedings; self-help by the inmate cannot be recognized as an acceptable remedy.  The risks inescapably attendant on the refusal of an inmate to carry out even an illegal order of a correction officer are such as to require compliance at the time with the right of retrospective administrative or judicial determination as to the legality of the order.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Court of Appeals -- Matters Reviewable -- Finding of Supreme Court Affirmed by Appellate Division</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Inasmuch as the Appellate Division affirmed the Supreme Court findings that petitioner's Muslim beliefs compelled him to avoid contact with members of the opposite sex outside of marriage which view was supported by testimony that the Qu'ran requires Muslims to avoid such physical contact, even when clothed, but that the &quot;sin&quot; of such contact might be forgiven if one's will to prevent it is violated in an emergency, these factual determinations are beyond the scope of the Court of Appeals review; moreover, the Appellate Division having affirmed the Supreme Court finding that a pat frisk by a female correction officer involves physical contact which is violative of the religious creed of a male Muslim inmate, such finding, too, is not reviewable in the Court of Appeals, there being evidence for its support in the record.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Supreme Court reversed and remanded to the court a judgment annulling a determination of respondent commission sustaining the imposition of corporate franchise tax assessments against petitioner taxpayer and held that the manner in which the state allowed corporations a tax credit on the accumulated income of their subsidiary domestic international sales corporations violated the commerce clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was assessed tax deficiencies because it failed to include in its entire net income accumulated income from its wholly owned subsidiary. The court held that certain clauses of the applicable statute were unconstitutional, but the remainder were valid, and thus affirmed the judgment as modified. The court found that the effect of its ruling was to extend the tax credit formerly available only to New York exports to all of the applicable accumulated income attributable to a parent corporation, without regard to the exports' place of shipment. The court determined that the statute, as so interpreted, promoted the legislature's intent to provide a strong incentive for the continuation and expansion of export-related business in New York by lowering the effective tax rate of any business that owned a domestic international sales corporation and it also advanced the legislature's purpose of minimizing losses because, even with an extension of the credit, the law continued to produce substantial tax revenues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment holding that the tax credit allowance violated the commerce clause was modified to hold that only certain clauses of the applicable statute were unconstitutional and, as modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Although clauses (2) and (3) of section 210 (subd 13, par [a]) of the Tax Law, relating to taxation of domestic international sales corporations (DISCs) are unconstitutional because they authorize credits which favor exports shipped from New York and discriminate against exports shipped from other States, the invalid portion may be severed from the valid and the remainder of the statute preserved on the authority of section 208 (subd 9, par [i], cl [B], subcl [3]) of the Tax Law which requires that DISC shareholders continue to be taxed, consistent with Federal law, on deemed distributions in the event taxation of accumulated income is invalidated and expresses the intention of the Legislature to salvage some revenues from the taxation of DISCs even if the statute was subsequently impaired.  Accordingly, only that portion of the tax credit that discriminates against exports shipped from outside of New York is invalidated, thus effectively extending the DISC tax credit formerly available only to New York exports to all of the DISC accumulated income attributable to the parent corporation, without regard to the exports' place of shipment.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent attorney appealed an order of the Appellate Division, Supreme Court, Third Department (New York) in a disciplinary proceeding commenced by the Committee on Professional Standards. A referee had sustained one charge. The Appellate Division confirmed the referee's report with respect to that charge, and confirmed portions of another charge. The issue concerned attorney's right to solicit accident victims by mail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was a lawyer disciplinary proceeding which resulted in attorney's suspension from the practice of law for six months. Attorney had solicited by mail the victims and families of the 250 persons injured when a sky-walk collapsed at a Kansas City hotel. Attorney solicited business by letters that were false and misleading and, in unrelated advertising, used a trade name. The court agreed with the referee's determinations. Two charges could be dismissed in their entirety but the charge was sustained that the references in the solicitation letter to a committee and to the fact that many victims had retained attorney were misleading. There was ample support in the record for the interpretation of petitioner that attorney's actions justified suspension and there was no need to establish that the letters actually mislead the recipients. It was the potential for deception which was significant in the unique situation of lawyer mailings to accident victims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the order and remitted the matter to the Appellate Division, Third Department, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs. The court agreed generally with the determinations of the referee and dismissed charges I and III and affirmed the determination on charge II that the references in attorney's solicitation letter to a committee and to the fact that many victims had retained attorney were misleading.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney and Client -- Disciplinary Proceedings -- Direct Mail Solicitation of Potential Clients</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A charge that respondent attorney violated section 479 of the Judiciary Law and the Code of Professional Responsibility by engaging in direct mail solicitation of the victim's and/or their families of the Hyatt Regency Hotel disaster in Kansas City, Missouri, is dismissed.  Inasmuch as the State seeks to regulate respondent's letter, not because of the involvement of third parties, but because of the subject matter of the communication -- the fact that respondent seeks to be retained to represent accident victims and their families, the regulation is plainly content-based; accordingly, since the State cannot establish interests of sufficient magnitude to override the public's interest in receiving information on the availability of legal services and the danger of deception presented by the mailing may be controlled by the filing requirement, the blanket prohibition of mail solicitation of accident victims violates respondent's rights of expression under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney and Client -- Disciplinary Proceedings -- Deception and Misrepresentation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner Committee on Professional Standards presented sufficient evidence to support allegations that respondent attorney employed deception and misrepresentation in letters mailed to victims and/or their families of the Hyatt Regency Hotel disaster in Kansas City, Missouri, seeking to be retained by them, which letters contained statements that a litigation coordinating committee had been formed to assist the victims and that many of the victims or their families had requested representation by respondent.  Petitioner satisfied its burden of proof by introducing the letters themselves, which, when interpreted in a commonsense manner, contained two deceptive statements; testimony by recipients of the mailings was not necessary before the writing could be found deceptive. Moreover, there was no need to establish that the letters actually mislead the recipients; it is the potential for deception which is significant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney and Client -- Disciplinary Proceedings -- Use of Trade Name</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The use of the motto &quot;The Country Lawyer&quot; in flyers advertising respondent attorney's services did not constitute a violation of the prohibition against use of a trade name contained in DR 2-102 (B).  Inasmuch as respondent's name was inserted apart from the motto, the use of the motto did not deceive the public about his identity, responsibility and status.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant homosexuals sought review of a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed an order of the trial court that denied their application for the older partner to adopt the younger partner in an attempt to legalize their homosexual relationship.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A homosexual couple sought to have the older partner adopt the younger partner in an effort to legalize their homosexual relationship. The lower court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that denied their adoption application. The homosexuals contended that, because New York recognized adoption of adults, the lower court erred in denying their application for adoption. The court disagreed, and affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The court held that where the homosexuals were living together in a homosexual relationship and where no incidents of a parent-child relationship were evidenced or even remotely within the parties' intentions, no fair interpretation of N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 110 could permit a granting of the petition. Adoption, the court held, was not a means of obtaining a legal status for a nonmarital sexual relationship, whether homosexual or heterosexual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the lower court, which held that the trial court properly denied the adoption petition of a homosexual couple because it was not the intention of the New York Legislature that adoption statutes be employed to legitimize homosexual relationships.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Adoption -- Adult Adoption -- Adoption of One Homosexual by Another</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It was not error for Family Court to deny the petition of a 57-year-old male to adopt a 50-year-old male with whom he shares a homosexual relationship; adoption is &quot;the legal proceeding whereby a person takes another person into the relation of child and thereby acquires the rights and incurs the responsibilities of parent&quot; (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 110), and where the relationship between the adult parties is utterly incompatible with the creation of a parent-child relationship between them, the adoption process is not the proper vehicle by which to formalize their partnership in the eyes of the law.  Adoption is not a quasi-matrimonial vehicle to provide nonmarried partners with a legal imprimatur for their sexual relationship, and because adoption is entirely statutory and is in derogation of common law, the legislative purposes and mandates must be strictly observed; while there are no special restrictions on adult adoptions under the provisions of the Domestic Relations Law, the Legislature could not have intended that the statute be employed to arrive at an unreasonable or absurd result.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed his conviction of attempted murder in the second degree, robbery in the first degree, and assault in the first degree. He argued that his in-court identification was unfair and prejudicial, that he was denied his right to a fair trial, and that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 650.20(1) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted murder, robbery, and assault in the stabbing of a liquor store co-owner. The appellate court's affirmation of the trial court's judgment of conviction was upheld on further appeal. Even if defendant's contention that the proper test for admissibility of photographs of a victim being attended in the hospital was a balancing of the inflammatory nature of the photographs against their materiality and relevance, the court found no abuse of discretion regarding their admission. Although the trial court should have articulated findings before trial as to the victim's in-court identification of defendant, no objection was made. The admission of the identification was beyond the court's power to review where there was evidence in the record sustaining the conclusion that there was an independent basis for the identification and there was no taint sufficient to constitute a substantial likelihood of misidentification. The court declined to reach defendant's argument that N.Y. Crim. Proc.

They were not gory, the lacerations they show having either been cleaned up or bandaged, and while the knife remaining embedded in the victim's back was startling in the sense of being unusual, the picture it presented of the knife was less unnerving than the oral testimony concerning it; nor did the &quot;startling&quot; nature of the photographs so far outweigh their relevance to defendant's complicity in the crime as to constitute an abuse of discretion as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Attorney-General, appealed a judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term in New York County (New York) that declared unconstitutional the provision of N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 343, punishing noncompliance with a subpoena issued thereunder as a misdemeanor, insofar as it applies to any person who has previously commenced proceedings pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 2304 seeking an order quashing or modifying such a subpoena.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In connection with an antitrust investigation of the ready-mix concrete industry in New York City, the appellant, New York Attorney-General, served subpoenas on plaintiffs pursuant to N.Y. Gen. Bus. Law &sect; 343. Plaintiffs moved pursuant to N.Y.C.P.L.R. 2304 to quash or modify the subpoenas. Appellant appealed the trial court's grant of injunctive relief to the Appellate Division and thereby obtained an automatic stay. Plaintiffs never moved to vacate or modify that stay. Plaintiffs commenced an action alleging that &sect; 343 was violative of plaintiffs' due process rights. The court held that, after balancing the competing interests of plaintiffs and appellant and the degree of protection which existing safeguards provided for plaintiffs in light of the particular facts and circumstances of the case, appellant was entitled, consistent with due process, to commence a criminal prosecution against plaintiffs for refusing to comply with the issued subpoenas even though a motion to quash the subpoenas was pending.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and &sect; 343 was declared constitutional insofar as it applies to persons who began a proceeding to quash or modify a subpoena prior to commencement of a criminal prosecution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attorney-General -- Subpoenas -- Motion to Quash -- Penalty for Failure to Comply with Subpoena -- Due Process of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Attorney-General was entitled, consistent with due process, to commence a criminal prosecution against plaintiffs pursuant to section 343 of the General Business Law for refusing to comply with subpoenas issued in connection with an antitrust investigation, even though a motion by plaintiffs pursuant to CPLR 2304 to quash the subpoenas was pending.  Although plaintiffs have substantial private interests at stake, since they face civil and criminal penalties should they be convicted of wrongfully refusing to obey the subject subpoenas, the government's interest in maintaining the Attorney-General's investigatory powers free from unnecessary hindrance is also substantial, and the adequacy of procedural remedies to protect plaintiffs from civil or criminal penalties establishes the reasonableness of the Attorney-General's action.  According to the express provisions of section 343 of the General Business Law, plaintiffs cannot be held criminally or civilly liable for refusing to comply with the Attorney-General's subpoenas unless they have done so &quot;without good cause&quot;, and this opportunity to challenge the propriety of the subpoenas in a criminal proceeding is an adequate procedural safeguard to insulate an individual from an erroneous deprivation of liberty or property.  In addition, while plaintiffs did move under CPLR 2304 to quash the subpoenas and successfully requested preliminary injunctive relief, the orders granting said relief were automatically stayed pursuant to CPLR 5519 by virtue of the Attorney-General's appeal to the Appellate Division and at no time did plaintiffs seek to vacate the statutory automatic stays; accordingly, plaintiffs failed to avail themselves of an additional opportunity to prevent accrual of penalties.  </SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review, arguing insufficient evidence to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, trial court errors depriving him of his right to fair trial, and unconstitutionality of the state death penalty statute. The court held that guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was adequately proven and no reversible errors had been committed by trial court.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Murder -- Killing of Person by Prisoner Serving Life Sentence -- Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. There is proof beyond a reasonable doubt of murder in the first degree (Penal Law, &sect; 125.27, subd 1, par [a], cl [iii]) to support the conviction of a defendant who, while serving an indeterminate sentence of from 25 years to life, killed a corrections officer; the evidence linked defendant to a bite mark on the corrections officer's body, and the remaining circumstantial evidence established that defendant had both the opportunity, and access to the materials, for killing the corrections officer and disposing of her body.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Mandatory Death Penalty -- Mitigating Circumstances</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. New York's mandatory death penalty statute (Penal Law, &sect; 60.06) for a person convicted of murder while &quot;confined in a state correctional institution * * * upon a sentence for an indeterminate term the minimum of which was at least fifteen years and the maximum of which was natural life&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 125.27, subd 1, par [a], cl [iii]) contravenes the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution as applied to defendant because of its failure to provide for consideration by the sentencer of the relevant individual circumstances of the defendant's character and record and the circumstances of the offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Capital Cases -- Scope of Review</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Under the State Constitution, in capital cases in which the sentence of death has been imposed, the Court of Appeals is empowered to review the facts (NY Const, art VI, &sect;&sect; 3, 5) and must examine the evidence to determine whether it has been sufficient to make out a case of murder beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, even in a capital case the Court of Appeals should not readily interfere with the verdicts of jurors who have had the advantage of seeing and hearing witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Evidence -- Photograph of Bite Mark on Body of Another Murder Victim</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. At the trial of a defendant charged with first degree murder for the killing of a corrections officer in 1981 while serving a life sentence, the trial court, after conducting a hearing out of the presence of the jury, properly held that a black and white photograph of a bite mark allegedly made by defendant in 1977 on the nose of another murder victim, Marilee Wilson, redacted so as to show little more than a jagged line representing the teeth marks, could be admitted into evidence and a comparison made to a photograph of a bite mark on the subject corrections officer's body.  Defendant's confession to the Wilson homicide was not obtained in violation of his constitutional rights; accordingly, the trial court properly found that there was independent basis for concluding that defendant was responsible for the Wilson bite mark.  Given the acceptability of photographs for comparisons of bite marks on a single victim and the other evidence, including expert testimony that a photo comparison of bite marks on different persons was a reliable and accepted procedure among forensic odontologists, the trial court did not err in permitting a photo-to-photo comparison of the Wilson bite mark with the bite mark on the corrections officer.  Finally, the probative value of the photograph of the Wilson bite mark outweighed its potential for unfair prejudice; the parties were required, in the presence of the jury, to refer to the Wilson photograph only as defendant's known bite mark in human tissue; and given the fact that the defense vigorously disputed the identification of the bite mark on the corrections officer's body by comparing it with models of defendant's teeth and elicited testimony that human skin was an ideal medium for bite mark identification, the identification of the bite mark through the photo comparison procedure cannot be dismissed as cumulative.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Evidence -- Newly Discovered Evidence -- Review by Court of Appeals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. In a noncapital case, the power to review a discretionary order denying a motion to vacate a judgment upon the ground of newly discovered evidence ceases at the Appellate Division; even in a capital case, the Court of Appeals has been most reluctant to substitute its discretion to overturn the lower courts' exercise of discretion in denying a motion for a new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Duty to Disclose Exculpatory Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In a prosecution for first degree murder arising out of the killing of a corrections officer by a prisoner serving a life sentence, the prosecutor did not breach his duty to disclose exculpatory material in failing to disclose a &quot;Chronological Report on Inmates Assigned to Special Housing Unit -- Downstate Correctional Facility&quot;; defendant's request did not put the prosecution on notice that this specific document existed and the record is devoid of any indication of prosecutorial bad faith or negligence; thus, a new trial would be required only if the material were obviously exculpatory and created a reasonable doubt not otherwise existing, and the subject report satisfies neither requirement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Fair Trial -- Duty to Disclose Exculpatory Evidence -- Correction of Error</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Any error in the prosecutor's nondisclosure of an &quot;unusual incident&quot; report, obtained by the defense from a third party in the midst of the prosecutor's summation, was cured when the trial court interrupted the People's summation, allowed defense counsel to recall the witness and place this evidence before the jury, and permitted defense counsel to address the jury on this issue before the prosecutor resumed his summation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Disqualification</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The Trial Judge's impartiality was not undermined merely by his appointment of the prosecutor whose conduct with respect to the submission of evidence to the Grand Jury was being questioned, the Trial Judge did not exhibit bias in denying several pretrial motions, and the decision on a recusal motion is generally a matter of personal conscience.  While it may have been the better practice for the Trial Judge to insure that defense counsel was aware of his previous relationship with the Special District Attorney, whom he had hired as an Assistant District Attorney when he was District Attorney of Dutchess County, the association was not so substantial that the Trial Judge abused his discretion in presiding over the trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Right to Counsel -- Delay in Appointing Counsel -- Disparity in Funding between Prosecution and Defense</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. In order to prevail on his appeal from a first degree murder conviction and death sentence arising from the May 15, 1981 death of a corrections officer, defendant must show that his defense was ineffective as a result of the delay in appointing his present counsel or the disparity in funding between the prosecution and defense.  Where defendant's present counsel first appeared for him on June 10, 1981 and declared he would serve without compensation, was replaced by the Public Defender in March 1982, after a funding impasse developed, and then in September 1982 was appointed defendant's counsel with compensation at the established rates for defense counsel, defendant has not shown that his defense was ineffective as a result of the delay or disparate funding.  The Court of Appeals cannot presume that the alleged errors resulted in a denial of meaningful representation where its independent review of the record belied this contention.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Venue</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. There was no error in the Appellate Division's conclusion that defendant's motion for a change of venue, made prior to jury selection, should have awaited the results of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">; since defendant failed to renew the motion following </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">voir dire</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, there is no other ruling for the Court of Appeals to review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Instructions -- Hypnotized Witness Charge</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Defendant failed to request a hypnotized witness instruction, and its absence from the charge does not warrant reversal in the interest of justice where, although several prosecution witnesses were hypnotized, the trial court determined that it would limit their testimony to events recalled prior to hypnosis, and defendant admits that the hypnosis issue was not a major factor before the jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Witnesses -- Cross-Examination of Witness Regarding Collateral Crime</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. In a first degree murder trial, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in prohibiting defense counsel from cross-examining a witness more extensively about the details of his testimony at his own murder trial; counsel had already mounted a substantial attack on the credibility of this witness and the limits placed on cross-examination regarding a collateral crime were not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumption of Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 13. To prevail on his claim that the State statute imposing the death penalty (Penal Law, &sect; 60.06) for first degree murder (Penal Law, &sect; 125.27) is unconstitutional, defendant must overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality which attaches to legislative enactments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Mandatory Death Penalty -- Remission for Consideration of Mitigating Circumstances</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. On defendant's appeal from a conviction of first degree murder (Penal Law, &sect; 125.27) and sentence of death, the Attorney-General's alternative argument that the Court of Appeals should deem the mandatory death penalty statute (Penal Law, &sect; 60.06) to include a provision for consideration of mitigating circumstances and remit for a hearing, is rejected.  Section 60.06 of the Penal Law provides that &quot;the court shall sentence the defendant to death&quot; upon a first degree murder conviction, and the Attorney-General's suggested interpretation is at odds with the wording of the statute and would require the Court of Appeals to rewrite the statute, which the court cannot do.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- First Degree Murder -- Authorized Disposition Following Determination that Mandatory Death Penalty</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Unconstitutional</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">15. Based upon its determination that defendant's guilt of murder in the first degree (Penal Law, &sect; 125.27, subd 1, par [a], cl [iii]) had been established, but that New York's mandatory death penalty statute (Penal Law, &sect; 60.06) is unconstitutional as applied to defendant, the Court of Appeals modified the judgment by vacating the sentence of death and remitting the case to Supreme Court for resentencing in accordance with section 70.00 of the Penal Law (see Penal Law, &sect; 60.05, subd 2).  </SPAN></P>

The public employees' associations sought judgments from various trial courts declaring that both statutes were unconstitutional under N.Y. Const. art.

The court held that &sect; 613(c), which limited the right of Tier III employees to recover their contributions to the retirement system, was unconstitutional because the legislature could not impair pension benefits by limiting the duration of the statute creating them. The court held that &sect; 606(c) was unconstitutional despite the fact that employees did not contribute to death benefits because death benefits were a benefit of membership in the retirement system and could not be impaired.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Benefits statutorily conferred upon members of ancy pension or retirement system of the State or of any division thereof must be interpreted as permanent, despite any provision of the statute limiting its duration, inasmuch as a contrary interpretation would render such a provision an unconstitutional impairment of contractual rights protected by section 7 of article V of the New York State Constitution by conferring a benefit and then, upon the expiration of the statute, taking it away.  Accordingly, subdivision c of section 613 of article 15 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, which became effective on September 1, 1983 (L 1983, ch 414, &sect; 1) violates section 7 of article V of the New York State Constitution and is unconstitutional insofar as it purports to abrogate the rights of employees hired on or after July 1, 1976 (commonly referred to as Tier III employees) and before September 1, 1983, to the return, at the time of termination of employment prior to the 10-year vesting period, of contributions to the New York State Employees' Retirement System made by them after July 1, 1976, and instead provides that such contributions will be refunded only when the member dies or reaches 62 years of age.  Moreover, such employees terminated before achieving 10 years' service are entitled to return of contributions made on or after July 1,  1976, including contributions made after September 1, 1983; the right to the return of all contributions made in reliance on section 517 of article 14 of the Retirement and Social Security Law was constitutionally protected, notwithstanding that article 14 was enacted for a limited duration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney of New York county, during an investigation of possible crimes of bribery among judges, served a grand jury subpoena duces tecum on the Administrator of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, seeking certain documents related to the Commission's investigation of the same charges.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A Grand Jury, acting in furtherance of a lawful investigation involving two Judges, may not subpoena confidential records of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct developed during an investigation into conduct of the Judges; the Legislature has the power to exempt certain records from Grand Jury scrutiny notwithstanding section 6 of article I of the New York Constitution, which states that &quot;[the] power of grand juries to inquire into the willful misconduct in office of public officers * * * shall never be suspended or impaired by law&quot;, and it has exercised that power with respect to confidential records of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct (Judiciary Law, &sect;&sect; 44, 45, 46).  The legislation creating the Commission and defining its powers was not designated to thwart the powers of the Grand Jury, but instead established an independent investigatory body to maintain the integrity of the judiciary, and while the Commission's power may indirectly result in a diminution of the scope of the Grand Jury's inquiry, it does not deprive the Grand Jury of its power to investigate a Judge or any other public official and therefore does not constitute a violation of the anti-impairment clause.  The Grand Jury's traditional investigative powers, although extensive,  are not unlimited, and it may not violate a valid privilege, whether derived from the Constitution, statutes or the common law; and sections 44, 45 and 46 of the Judiciary Law, which establish a legislative scheme to insure the confidentiality of Commission records, were intended to prohibit disclosure to the Grand Jury; a specific provision prohibiting such disclosure was not required to accomplish that purpose.  </SPAN></P>

Within two months, the agency removed the child from the mother's care because the mother was intoxicated. The agency filed a petition requesting permanent removal under N.Y. Fam. Ct.

On appeal of the dismissal of the petition, the court held that &sect; 1039(e) equated a violation of an ACD order with parental neglect but did not provide for a hearing or a finding of actual parental neglect. The court held that due process and protected privacy rights prohibited governmental interference in the rights of a parent except on a showing of overriding necessity. The court held that the mere violation of an ACD order did not necessarily amount to any constitutionally required predicate for removal of a child from his home.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) held that appellant creditor could not attach real property belonging to respondent property owners in an attachment proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 6212 and that the property owners could not recover damages against the creditor for mental distress. Both sides appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor, an automobile finance company, discovered that one of its dealers had fraudulently obtained floor plan financing and failed to pay the purchase price for several vehicles. As a result, the creditor obtained an ex parte attachment order directing the sheriff of any county to levy upon property in which the debtor had an interest. The creditor filed a notice of attachment regarding real property that was at one time in the name of the debtor but that was subsequently conveyed to the debtor's wife. The wife then conveyed the property to the property owners who had no notice of the attachment. After the creditor attempted to have the land sold at auction, the property owners brought an action to vacate the attachment and notice of sale. The court held that where the moving papers did not contain any ground for attachment against the debtor's wife's property, the attachment was invalid. It also ruled that the record did not establish actual malice sufficient for an award of damages against the creditor where it showed no more than that the attachment was issued on behalf of its attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment denying the validity of the creditor's attachment and denying recovery of mental distress damages to the property owners.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Attachment -- Damages -- Mental Distress</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">To sustain a warrant of attachment against the property of a defendant, the moving papers must establish both a cause of action and a ground for attachment as to that particular defendant; as to an attachment issued without ground, the owner of the property, though not a party to the underlying action, may, in a proceeding to CPLR 6212 (subd [e]), recover damages for mental distress upon a showing of actual malice. CPLR 6212 (subd [a]) provides that to obtain an attachment plaintiff &quot;shall show * * * that there is a cause of action, that it is probable that the plaintiff will succeed on the merits, that one or more grounds for attachment * * * exist and that the amount demanded from the defendant exceeds all counterclaims known to the plaintiff&quot;; that plaintiff must show the existence of a ground for attachment as to each defendant against whom he seeks a warrant necessarily follows.  CPLR 6212 (subd [e]) authorizes an award of damages to property owners and others who had an interest in the property attached but were not defendants in the action in which the order of attachment was granted.  Recovery for mental distress is not limited to situations involving outrageous conduct, and the award of damages under CPLR 6212 and 6221 is governed by the rules relating to an action for wrongful attachment; whether the action be denominated for trespass or conversion or for malicious prosecution through the wrongful use of civil proceedings, the action is closely akin to malicious prosecution, and damages for emotional distress of a kind normally expected to follow from the wrongful action are recoverable in such an action; however, evidence only that an attachment was issued on plaintiff's behalf by its attorney is insufficient to establish actual malice. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five defendants appealed the decision of the Supreme Court, Appellate Division (New York), which affirmed their various felony convictions and their receipt of an enhanced punishment pursuant to the second violent offender law or the persistent violent offender law pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 70.04 and 70.08.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of various felony convictions and were assessed an enhanced punishment under the second violent offender statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.04, and persistent violent offender law, N.Y. Penal Law. &sect;70.08. Defendants appealed. The lower court affirmed, and appeal was taken. The court held that a sentence as multiple offender was not to be viewed either as new jeopardy or additional penalty for earlier crime but was stiffened penalty for latest crime, which was considered to be an aggravated offense because it was a repetitive one. Thus, the fact that a predicate crime was not designated as a violent felony offense at the time the predicate offense was committed did not render the application by defendants of statutes governing a second violent felony offender and persistent violent offender unconstitutional as imposition of an ex post facto law. The court held that where defendants pleaded guilty to two violent felony offenses on the same day and were sentenced on a single day to concurrent prison terms, defendants could not be sentenced under the persistent violent felony statute, even though the charges arose out of separate incidents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed three defendants' felony convictions pursuant to the state's second violent offender law or the persistent violent offender law. Two defendants' convictions were modified by substituting, for the persistent violent felony offender adjudication, a second violent felony offense adjudication and were remitted for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Second and Persistent Felony Offenders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Both the second violent offender law (Penal Law, &sect; 70.04) and the persistent violent felony offender law (Penal Law, &sect; 70.08) require imposition of enhanced punishment upon conviction as a second or persistent violent felony offender, even though at the time of the prior conviction on which enhanced punishment is based the prior crime was not classified as a violent felony offense; section 70.04 (subd 1, par [b]) of the Penal Law makes it clear that the enhanced punishment provisions of sections 70.04 and 70.08 are to apply when the prior crime was committed between September 1, 1967 (the effective date of the present Penal Law) and September 1, 1978 (the effective date of the violent offender law).  It is inconceivable that the Legislature intended to exclude from the predicate crime category crimes committed in New York between those dates but not the identical crimes prior to September 1, 1967 or committed in another State; that the predicate crime was not designated a &quot;violent felony offense&quot; when committed does not require a contrary conclusion so long as the elements of the crime when committed were the same as those of an offense now defined as a violent felony offense by subdivision 1 of section 70.02 of the Penal Law. Furthermore, there is no violation of the restriction against ex post facto laws contained in article I (&sect; 10, cl 1) of the United States Constitution; a sentence as a multiple offender is not to be viewed as either a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes, but is a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one.  Accordingly, the convictions of three defendants sentenced as second or persistent violent felony offenders are affirmed even though the predicate convictions antedated the effective date of the statute classifying the crime on which the conviction was based as a violent felony offense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Persistent Felony Offenders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature did not intend the persistent violent felony law (Penal Law, &sect; 70.08) to apply unless each of the two or more predicate violent felony convictions other than the first was for a felony which occurred after sentence had been imposed for the conviction which preceded it; it was not intended that the two or more predicate violent felony offenses required as the predicate for enhanced punishment under the statute be determined individually, i.e., by the separate crimes committed without regard to the fact that convictions may have been jointly obtained.  A legislative policy of sequentiality (i.e., the second offense, to be counted as a predicate, must be committed after sentence was imposed on the first) has been established for second felony offenders, persistent felony offenders, second violent felony offenders, and by cross reference for persistent violent felony offenders as well, and it was not intended that sequentiality should apply between the present and each of the prior convictions but not between the prior convictions themselves.  Accordingly, persistent violent felony adjudications against two defendants who pleaded guilty to two violent felony offenses on the same day, the charges having arisen out of separate incidents, and who were sentenced on a single day to concurrent prison sentences, are vacated, and the cases are remitted for sentencing of the defendants as second violent felony offenders.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Second and Persistent Felony Offenders</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Where the predicate offense under the second violent offender law (Penal Law, &sect; 70.04) and the persistent violent offender law (Penal Law, &sect; 70.08) is only so classified because it occurs after a plea of guilty to a lesser included offense, there is no statutory infirmity in the failure to recite in the predicate felony information that the prior conviction was obtained upon a plea of guilty or any constitutional defect because the same offense would not be classified as a violent felony if conviction had been obtained after trial.  There was no jurisdictional defect because the sentencing minutes include the Judge's statement that &quot;there has been no jury connected with any of these prior criminal acts.&quot; Since the information stated the prior conviction to have been for attempted criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree and made specific reference to subdivision 1 of section 70.02 of the Penal Law, which refers to a lesser included offense as defined in CPL 220.20, it is clear that the offense could be a lesser included offense only when conviction is on a plea of guilty and not by verdict ( CPL 220.20, subd 2); therefore, the claimed missing allegation is sufficiently incorporated by reference.  Defendant was aware when he entered his guilty pleas to the prior offenses that the offense to which he pleaded existed essentially only for the purposes of plea negotiation, reliance on the prior indictment is minimal, and the enhanced punishment imposed constitutes no violation of due process.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted resisting arrest and sought review. Defendant argued that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 60.35 and N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 420.35, providing for the levying and collection of a mandatory surcharge following every criminal conviction, violated the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the lower courts affirming defendant's conviction for attempted resisting arrest and upholding the statutes providing for the levying of mandatory surcharges for criminal convictions.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The mandatory penalty assessment law ( Penal Law, &sect; 60.35; CPL 420.35) does not offend the equal protection clause by creating an irrational classification, since the statute treats all persons convicted of Penal Law offenses similarly, and it is of no moment that this group is singled out for this assessment.  The &quot;rational relationship&quot; test sought to be applied by defendant would only be relevant if the State sought to treat similarly situated individuals in a different&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  manner.  Because these statutes do not employ suspect classifications or adversely affect fundamental rights, the only rationality test which must be passed is the determination of &quot;whether the challenged classification bears a reasonable relationship to some legitimate legislative objective&quot;, and the penalty would appear to be related, at the very least, to the State's legitimate interest in raising revenues.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former husband brought an action for divorce. The parties owned no property of substance other than the former husband's vested, but unmatured, rights in a police department's pension plan. The divorce was ultimately granted, and the trial court found the present value of the former wife's share of the pension and gave the former husband three options to pay the award; one option was for the former husband to pay one-half of his monthly pension payments to the former wife. On appeal, the appellate division modified the property division because the former husband had no present ability to pay the award and deleted the alternate forms of payment. The court affirmed the appellate court's order, holding that the trial court had the discretion to divide the former husband's vested but unmatured pension because it was acquired between the date of the marriage and the commencement of the divorce action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order modifying the trial court's distribution of the former husband's vested, but unmatured, rights in a pension plan.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Equitable Distribution -- Vested Rights in Noncontributory Pension Plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Vested rights in a noncontributory pension plan are marital property to the extent that they were acquired between the date of the marriage and the commencement of a matrimonial action, even though the rights are unmatured at the time the action is begun; the matrimonial court in the exercise of the discretion vested in it by part B of section 236 of the Domestic Relations Law may order distribution to one spouse of an equitable portion of that part of the present value of the other spouse's pension rights earned during marriage, or may provide that upon maturity of the pension rights the recipient pay a portion of each payment received to his or her former spouse or may, if it determines that valuation or other problems make equitable distribution impractical or burdensome, order a distributive award in lieu of equitable distribution.  To the extent that pension rights result from employment time after marriage and before commencement of a matrimonial action, they are contract rights of value, received in lieu of higher compensation which would otherwise have enhanced either marital assets or the marital standard of living and, therefore, are marital property; distribution of the pension does not diminish or impair it contrary to the State Constitution (art V, &sect; 7) since the pension of the employee spouse is not diminished in the sense that the pension fund will pay any lesser amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Equitable Distribution -- Method of Payment of Pension Rights -- Review by Court of Appeals</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Whether marital property shall be distributed or a distributive award shall be made in lieu of, or to supplement, facilitate or effectuate a distribution of marital property are matters committed by section 236 (part B, subd 5) of the Domestic Relations Law to the discretion of the Trial Judge in the first instance; the authority of the Appellate Division is as broad as that of the Trial Judge, and absent an exercise of discretion so egregious that it can be characterized as an abuse as a matter of law, its exercise of discretion is not reviewable by the Court of Appeals.  A change by the Appellate Division in the procedure of payment of defendant's portion of future pension payments received by plaintiff is thus beyond review in the Court of Appeals, and inasmuch as the Trial Judge had directed the use, as the numerator of the fraction by which the final average salary is multiplied, of the number of months the parties were married, by limiting the numerator to the number of months prior to the commencement of the action during which the parties were married, the Appellate Division simply conformed the judgment to the statutory definition of marital property as property acquired before commencement of the matrimonial action (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 236, part B, subd 1, par c).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Alimony and Allowances -- Deletion of Provisions for Future Changes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. It was not error for the Appellate Division to delete provisions contained in a judgment of divorce for future changes in maintenance and support; the husband, having argued before the Appellate Division that both modifications should be deleted, will not now be heard to say that, because the wife did not cross-appeal to the Appellate Division, deletion of the provision for future decrease of his maintenance payments was improper, and moreover, deletion of both the increase and decrease provisions was correct.  The maintenance and support provisions of a matrimonial decree are discretionary determinations and to direct a future change on the occurrence of any given fact ignores the possibility of change in other factors affecting the computation; except when a judgment provides for an imminent and measurable change, or where statutory provision expressly requires otherwise, such a judgment should not include provision for increase or decrease upon the happening of a particular future event.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several charges were brought against an attorney that was also acting as a city judge and the commission recommended her censure. On appeal, the attorney asserted that she was denied procedural and substantive due process during the investigation and was the target of a general inquest and fishing expedition by the commission. The attorney further claimed that the determination by the commission was arbitrary and capricious, and not supported by substantial evidence. The court found that the charges against the attorney were supported by the evidence and that censure was not enough and that the appropriate sanction was removal from office. The court ruled that the unmistakable impression from the conduct was that the attorney and her husband were acting as a team. The court found that because of the attorney's prior association with some of the defendants and because of her husband's relationship to her, special favor and consideration could have been obtained through retention of the attorney's husband. The court reasoned that removal was not normally to be imposed for poor judgment, even extremely poor judgment, but that the attorney's conduct transcended poor judgment.</SPAN></P>

When a Judge acts in such a way that she appears to have used the prestige and authority of judicial office to enhance personal relationships, or for purely selfish reasons, or to bestow favors, that conduct is to be condemned whether or not the Judge acted deliberately and overtly.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York), which convicted defendant of first degree usury, pursuant to N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 190.42, as well as one count of second degree usury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's trial for criminal usury, one juror gave the trial judge a note stating that he felt it was impossible for him to render a fair verdict under the charge the jury was given. Subsequent to a revised charge, defendant was convicted. Defendant contended the trial court erred in denying the motion for a mistrial based on the juror's note. Defendant also argued that the usury statute under which defendant was convicted was unconstitutionally vague. The court held that the juror's note, without more, did not warrant a mistrial, and that the trial court acted properly in recharging the jury. Analyzing the usury statute, the court held the terms &quot;scheme&quot; and &quot;business&quot; were not impermissibly vague because the terms' substantive meanings could be readily imported from their normal dictionary definitions. The court then held sufficient evidence existed to convict defendant under the statute. Additionally, the court held that, although the trial court erred in denying a hearing to determine whether a conflict of interest was caused by the fact that defendant' s trial counsel had represented the State's chief witness, the court held the error did not require reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed because the statute under which defendant was convicted was not unconstitutionally vague, and the trial court's error in denying a hearing based on a possible conflict of interest did not require reversal.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Use of the terms &quot;scheme or business of making or collecting usurious loans&quot; in section 190.42 of the Penal Law does not render the statute unconstitutionally vague; in the context of the statute, it is clear that what is denoted is a series of transactions, multiple as to loans if not borrowers, which are usurious and are made by the same person under such circumstances that they can factually be found to be interrelated and to constitute parts of an integrated single operation.  Further, the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction of criminal usury in the first degree under said statute where there was evidence that, in order to provide the financial resources to ensure the continued operation of a club in which defendant had a substantial economic interest, he made two loans to one individual, followed by two more loans to the same individual for his personal use over a period of some eight months, all at usurious rates of interest, and made collections of such interest on all four loans over a period of some 12 months, and the jury was warranted under the instructions of the trial court, to which no exception was taken,  to conclude that such conduct constituted a &quot;scheme or business of making or collecting usurious loans&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Discharge of Juror -- Mistrial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A note from one juror, delivered to the Trial Judge during the course of jury deliberations, stating that the juror could not &quot;render a fair and a just verdict in accordance with the Court's instruction&quot;, without more, did not mandate the declaration of a mistrial. Although inquiry of the juror might have elicited information warranting a mistrial in the absence of defendant's consent to the replacement of the juror ( CPL 270.35), defendant's contention that the Trial Judge should have questioned the juror before proceeding was not preserved for review in view of his counsel's failure to request such relief or to join in the prosecution's suggestion that such an inquiry be undertaken; as it was, on being reinstructed, the juror continued to participate in the jury deliberations and joined in the unanimous verdict of guilty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Counsel -- Conflict of Interest on Part of Defense Counsel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Although the trial court erred in failing to inquire of defendant whether he understood the risks of a potential conflict of interest on the part of his counsel, where defense counsel had previously represented the prosecution's chief witness on various criminal charges and the prosecution called this potential conflict of interest to the court's attention prior to trial; however, defendant is not entitled to a reversal of his conviction in view of his failure to demonstrate that there existed a conflict of interest or at least the significant possibility thereof in the circumstances of the attorney's conduct of his defense.  Defense counsel's searching cross-examination of said witness on defendant's trial confirms that the attorney conducted the defense on the operational premise that he no longer owed any professional obligation to his former client.  </SPAN></P>

After its request for a redetermination was denied, petitioner commenced a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding for review. The trial court dismissed the petition and the appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 181 was unconstitutional because it impermissibly discriminated against foreign corporations in violation of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The court found that &sect; 181 imposed an actual burden on interstate commerce because if similar tax schemes were enacted in other states, a proliferation of insular trade areas providing economic advantages to domestic business would follow, resulting in a continuing need for corporations to relocate, fractionalize, or cease operations, which would substantially and impermissibly burden interstate commerce. The State of New York's excessive license fees on foreign corporations was an unlawful attempt to tax that portion of the petitioner's stock that had no nexus to New York.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 181 of the Tax Law, which imposes a higher license fee on businesses incorporated outside New York than the organization tax imposed on domestic enterprises, impermissibly discriminates against foreign corporations and imposes an unlawful burden on interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause of the United States Constitution (US Const, art I, &sect; 8, cl 3).  Accordingly, it was error for the State Tax Commission to sustain a notice of deficiency issued to petitioner, a foreign corporation licensed to do business in New York, on the ground that it owed an additional license fee for 1971 which was assessed upon a change in petitioner's capital structure pursuant to section 181.  The statute is constitutionally defective in that it attempts to attract foreign corporations to locate in New York by imposing discriminatory and excessive burdens on those corporations in hopes of neutralizing advantages conferred by their home States thereby inducing them to abandon their present domiciles and incorporate in New York to avoid those excessive burdens; such discrimination is not justified because domestic corporations are subject to New York's organization tax on all of their authorized shares of stock while foreign corporations are taxed by New York only on issued shares employed in New York; petitioner must also pay organization taxes to its home State on all its authorized stock and, therefore, any attempt by New York to compensate for lower organizational taxes in other States by imposing an excessive license fee on foreign corporations is nothing more than an unlawful attempt to tax that portion of petitioner's stock which has no nexus to New York and is clearly unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

The commissioner issued orders that the physician discontinue the practice of medicine in any form for an initial period of 60 days and then two successive 60-day periods. The court reversed the order of the appellate court and reinstated the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: 1) N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 230(12) provided that the commissioner had the power to order a physician to discontinue the practice of medicine in any form; 2) &sect; 230(12) limited the effectiveness of a suspension order to 60 days, except in narrowly defined circumstances; 3) the commissioner was justified in concluding that the practice of medicine by the physician posed a threat to the health of the public; but 4) circumstances did not exist to justify the commissioner's further orders and the commissioner was not authorized to issue orders continuing the initial suspension; and 5) the physician's application to annul should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Pursuant to subdivision 12 of section 230 of the Public Health Law, which authorizes the Commissioner of Health of the State of New York (Commissioner) to suspend summarily a physician's license to practice medicine pending disciplinary hearings on charges of professional misconduct by the State Board for Professional Medical Conduct, the Commissioner has the power, if circumstances warrant, to order a physician to discontinue the practice of medicine in any form; however, the statute does not permit the Commissioner to continue such a suspension beyond the statutory 60-day period except in those situations expressly provided for in the statute.  Accordingly, the Commissioner could properly suspend petitioner physician's license to practice medicine entirely for 60 days once allegations of professional misconduct and medical evidence against petitioner went beyond his obstetric practice to raise serious questions concerning his competence in general practice; however, since petitioner had already been suspended for a period in excess of 60 days, the Commissioner could not validly issue additional orders imposing successive periods of suspension where the narrowly defined circumstances justifying further suspension were not presented.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The 180-day period for trial of charges against one who has served a request for final disposition thereof pursuant to the Interstate Agreement on Detainers ( CPL 580.20) is not tolled during the period of his detention in another county for prosecution on a charge pending in that county since a defendant is not thereby &quot;unable to stand trial&quot; within the meaning of the statute and is not to be penalized by application of the tolling provision when his unavailability is the consequence of the conduct of the public authorities; some of the period will be excluded, however, if it may properly be attributed to the disposition of an omnibus motion made by the defendant with respect to the charges in the first county, and the period to be excluded is not a normal time reasonably to be assigned to the disposition of a similar motion, but is rather the period of delay, if any, which in the individual case may be actually ascribed to consideration and determination of the particular motion.</SPAN></P>

The Interstate Agreement on Detainers ( CPL 580.20) provides for a 180-day period for the trial of charges against one who has served a request for final disposition thereof pursuant to it, and although the facts in a particular instance may warrant a determination that the defendant has elected not to assert or has abandoned his rights under the Agreement on Detainers and has chosen to proceed to disposition without reference thereto, such a determination is not warranted merely because the defendant takes steps to prepare for trial such as by way of a suppression motion, whether before or after the expiration of the statutory 180-day period; there is nothing necessarily inconsistent in proceeding to prepare for disposition by trial and in claiming the right to benefits under the Agreement on Detainers; and a defendant's exercise of the full panoply of his pretrial procedural rights should not be deterred by the risk that he may thereby jeopardize his rights under the Agreement on Detainers, there being no necessary interrelation between the two.</SPAN></P>

It was not harmless error to refuse to suppress a statement concerning the death of a victim of a homicide obtained from a defendant convicted of murder in the second degree, robbery in the first degree and criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, in violation of his right to counsel and testified to at trial by the police officer who took the statement, when that statement, although in some respects similar to one made to and testified to by another witness, contains a more detailed and damaging account of the event as well as of defendant's incriminating conduct thereafter.  Strikingly absent from the statement testified to by the other witness was any explicit admission of a robbery or attempted robbery at gunpoint or of defendant's possession and production of the weapon which brought about the victim's death, as well as of defendant's after-the-event conduct by way of disposing of the gun and leaving the country under an assumed name, all of which, taken with the fact that the police officer testified from a contemporaneous written record of the statement made to him, might well have weighed heavily with the jury in its determination of defendant's guilt of the crimes of which he was convicted.  </SPAN></P>

Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 22, &sect; 660.35 was not unconstitutional on its face.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a declaratory judgment action challenging the constitutionality of a mandatory precalendar conference rule (22 NYCRR 660.35) effective in New York County for all pretrial matters related to wrongful death and personal injury actions, an order of the Appellate Division, which modified a judgment declaring the rule constitutional on its face but unconstitutional as applied, by vacating so much of the judgment as declared the rule unconstitutional as applied, is further modified by dismissing the complaint.  The Appellate Division correctly determined that any objections plaintiffs have to the application of the rule in a particular case may be considered in the normal course in the context of that litigation;  however, the court should also have dismissed the complaint as to the challenge of the facial validity of the rule, since plaintiffs, as litigants in pending cases, were attempting to review a ruling or prospective ruling in pending litigation, thus circumventing the appellate process, and a declaratory judgment action may not be employed to avoid restrictions applicable to litigation in which the challenged rule is pertinent, except when the party seeking the ruling would otherwise have no right to appeal. </SPAN></P>

Highway Law &sect; 88 precluded the removal of billboards without just compensation to the billboard owners. The billboard owners applied for an extension of the amortization period as permitted under the ordinance and the town denied their applications.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Notwithstanding the amendments of the Federal Highway Beautification Act of 1965 (US Code, tit 23, &sect; 131), compensation need not be paid by a municipality which requires removal of outdoor advertising signs, provided a reasonable amortization period is allowed by the removal ordinance, and as applied to petitioners, a local ordinance enacted in May, 1972, which provided for the removal of nonconforming outdoor advertising billboards on or before June 1, 1975, but gave an owner the opportunity to apply to the town board for an extension of the amortization period prescribed by the ordinance, is not unreasonable.  Neither Federal nor State law preempts the right of a town in the exercise of its police power to require removal of such commercial billboards, and the amortization period was reasonable as applied to petitioners' billboards since they had fully recouped their investments, substantially depreciated their billboards for income tax purposes, had relatively insubstantial lease and license obligations and thus would not incur any substantial financial loss; moreover, the town board's conclusion that the public benefit from removal of the billboards outweighed the detriment to petitioners was not arbitrary or capricious. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner City Clerk challenged an order of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which entered a judgment in respondent Board of Elections' favor in the City Clerk's declaratory judgment action in which he sought to compel the Board of Elections to include the offices of mayor and of president of the city's common council in the upcoming election and asserted that N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 2-a was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined in the City Clerk's declaratory judgment action against the Board of Elections that N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 2-a did not violate the state constitution by allowing elected officials to serve beyond the current election year and that the former mayor's death did not require the inclusion of the offices of mayor and of president of the city's common council in the upcoming election. The court affirmed that judgment on appeal. The court concluded that there was no relation between N.Y. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3's statutory prescriptions and N.Y. Gen. City Law &sect; 2-a(1), (2). The court noted that the constitutional provision addressed the filling of vacancies in public office and that the latter dealt with the automatic and instantaneous devolution of powers and duties of certain specified public offices. The court also held that the constitutional provision restricted the term only as to persons that were appointed to office and that the statutory provisions addressed elective offices' powers and duties.</SPAN></P>

Accordingly, no vacancy in the office of Mayor or President of the Common Council of the City of Albany requiring an election before the fall of 1985 was created by reason of the death in 1983 of the former Mayor during his term of office, the duties of said offices having devolved upon the former President and President Pro Tempore of the Common Council of the City of Albany, respectively, pursuant to the provisions of section 2-a of the General City Law.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated appeals, appellants sought review of two orders. First, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) declared that decedent's trust was neither impossible to administer nor illegal. Second, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department, ordered the will of another decedent construed so as to permit gender-neutral scholarship awards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented on appeal was whether the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was violated when the trial court permitted the administration of private charitable trusts according to the testators' intent to finance the education of male students and not female students. The court concluded that when the trial court applied a trust law that neither encouraged, affirmatively promoted, or compelled private discrimination, but allowed the parties to engage in private selection in the bequest of their property, that choice was neither attributable to the state or subject to the Fourteenth Amendment. Although the restrictions in the trusts at issue arguably ran contrary to public efforts promoting equality of opportunity for women, that did not justify imposing a per se rule that gender restrictions in private charitable trusts violated public policy. The Fourteenth Amendment did not require the state to exercise the full extent of its power to eradicate private discrimination. It was only when the state itself discriminated, compelled another to discriminate, or allowed another to assume one of its functions and discriminate, that such discrimination was implicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Accordingly, the order in the first appeal was affirmed; however, the order in the second appeal was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Trusts -- Gender-Based Classification of Beneficiaries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution is not violated when a court permits the administration of private charitable trusts according to the testators' intent to finance the education of male students and not female students; when a court applies trust law that neither encourages nor affirmatively promotes nor compels private discrimination, but allows parties to engage in private selection in the devise or bequest of their property, that choice will not be attributable to the State.  Accordingly, a court may properly reform a testamentary trust creating a scholarship fund to benefit male students selected by a local board of education by substituting a private trustee in place of the designated public trustee who is unwilling or unable to act according to the discriminatory terms of the trust; similarly, a court may reform a testamentary trust established for the benefit of those male students certified by the local superintendent of schools as having achieved the highest grades in certain subjects by eliminating the certification requirement and permitting students to apply directly to the bank named as trustee in the will.  </SPAN></P>

The court reversed the lower court and reinstated the findings of the trial court. The court held that N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner police officer was told that a person he associated himself with was a known felon.

A penalty of 10 days' forfeiture of accrued vacation time was imposed. The lower court confirmed respondent's determination. On review, the court affirmed the judgment from the lower court. The court found that the police department regulation that barred members of the police department from associating with persons known to have been convicted of any misdemeanor or felony was not unconstitutionally overbroad.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that N.Y. Legis.

The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, affirmed the trial court's denial of the school district's motion to dismiss the complaint but struck that portion of the trial court's order that permitted the electric utility to verify its letters of protest nunc pro tunc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electric utility claimed the school district's levies were illegal because they exceeded the two percent constitutional limitation on taxation of real property. It alleged the taxes were paid under protest but it did not allege compliance with the provisions of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3813. The trial court denied the school district's motion to dismiss the complaint, and the appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. Taxes assessed and collected in violation of the constitutional authority were properly recovered by a plenary action for moneys had and received. Also, the complaint alleging the involuntary payment of a void tax could not have been properly dismissed for insufficiency because of the electric utility's failure to plead compliance with the provisions of &sect; 3813. Because the action for the return of a void tax raised only a legal issue, there was no need for a prior notice of claim to allow for investigation, adjustment, or administrative action. The only purpose &sect; 3813 served in such an action was to give the school district notice of a claim of illegality and a potential lawsuit, which was accomplished by the electric utility's involuntary payment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, a trial judge, and defendants, two alleged prostitutes, challenged an order of the Appellate Division of Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment granting petitioner district attorney's motion to convert a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding into a declaratory action, holding N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 340.40(2) constitutional, and denying the alleged prostitutes' entitlement to jury trials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were two women accused of prostitution, which carried a three-month maximum sentence. Defendants contended that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 340.40(2) was unconstitutional because it directed that crimes not punishable by more than six months incarceration were to be heard by a trial judge. Respondent trial judge granted defendants' motion for a jury trial. Petitioner district attorney commenced an action to obtain a writ of prohibition, which was converted to a declaratory action. The special term court granted petitioner's motion and determined the statute was constitutional, and the appellate division affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment as modified. The appellate court determined the declaratory judgment attacking the criminal court's interlocutory ruling was properly granted because the validity of a statute was at issue, no questions of fact were involved, and the declaratory judgment would have an obvious effect on future cases involving the same questions. However, the declaratory action was improperly heard against defendants in the underlying criminal action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the judgment, declaring that conversion to a declaratory action was proper. However, it was an abuse of discretion to entertain an action for declaratory judgment where there was pending between defendants an action that would fully dispose the controversy. Thus, the order was modified by striking the declaration that defendants were not entitled to a jury trial and dismissing the petitions as to defendants.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In rare instances when a criminal court makes an interlocutory ruling in favor of a defendant that will both affect fundamental rights and have implications reaching far beyond the immediate case, an independent action by the People for declaratory relief may be allowed where the controversy is purely a legal one involving the validity of a statute, where there is no immediate attempt to prevent the criminal court from proceeding on the course charted by its ruling and where the circumstances warrant permitting such an action.  Accordingly, the People properly commenced an action for declaratory relief in Supreme Court against a Criminal Court Judge who ruled that CPL 340.40 (subd 2), which provides that crimes punishable by not more than six months' imprisonment be heard before a Judge, is unconstitutional as applied to defendants charged with prostitution in New York City; said ruling was based on a holding that prostitution is a &quot;serious&quot; crime and comes within the Sixth Amendment guarantee of trial by jury, notwithstanding that it carries a maximum sentence of three months' imprisonment. However, it was improper for the Supreme Court to have heard the declaratory judgment action as against the defendants in the underlying criminal action, since there is another action pending between the parties and the controversy has been decided.</SPAN></P>

CPL 340.40 (subd 2), which provides that crimes punishable by not more than six months' incarceration shall, in the City of New York, be heard before a Judge, does not violate the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution as applied to defendants charged with prostitution, inasmuch as prostitution is not a &quot;serious&quot; offense within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of trial by jury, being punishable by a maximum of three months' imprisonment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from the order of the Monroe County Court (New York), which reversed the city court's order dismissing an information charging defendants with disorderly conduct under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with disorderly conduct, but the city court dismissed the informations, concluding that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 240.20(2) was unconstitutional because it was overly broad and vague. The statute prohibited the making of unreasonable noise with intent to cause public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof. The county court reversed and remitted the cases for further proceedings on the informations. Defendants sought further judicial review, arguing that because noises were neither reasonable nor unreasonable, the term &quot;unreasonable noise&quot; was meaningless and vague. Further, they argued that &sect; 240.20(2) was overbroad because it attempted to govern every possible situation, and thus, provided inadequate standards for enforcement. The court affirmed the judgment reinstating the informations, concluding that the term unreasonable noise was not undefined. Rather, it described a noise of a type or volume that a reasonable person, under the circumstances, would not tolerate. Similarly, the requirement that the noise be intended to cause, or recklessly create a risk of, public inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm, narrowed the definition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the county court's judgment upholding the validity of the statute and reinstating the charges, holding, in a per curiam opinion, that the statute was not unconstitutional, either for vagueness or for overbreadth.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners asserted that the interest rate which the city proposed to pay for condemned property was not just compensation. The trial court set the interest rate to be paid based upon expert reports and the appellate division affirmed without opinion. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that six percent interest for the period from June, 1972 to December, 1977, and nine percent interest from January 1, 1978 to the date of payment was just compensation. The court determined that although the rate of six percent set by the legislature was presumptively reasonable, the property owners had rebutted the presumption for the period after January 1, 1978 because they introduced evidence of prevailing market rates which showed that the statutory rate was so unreasonably low that it deprived them of just compensation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 3-a of the General Municipal Law sets a rate of interest on condemnation awards against municipal corporations which is presumptively reasonable; however, a claimant may introduce relevant evidence of prevailing market rates to rebut the statutory presumption of reasonableness. Accordingly, claimants are entitled to interest on awards for fixtures at the statutory rate of 6% from the time of the taking in 1972 through 1977 (General Municipal Law, &sect; 3-a, subd 2) and at a rate of 9% from 1978 through the time of payment of the award, since there is sufficient evidence to support affirmed findings of fact that an award at the statutory rate was adequate for the 1972-1977 period but was inadequate for the 1978-1981 period and that a median interest rate of 9% was necessary to meet the constitutional requirement of &quot;just compensation&quot; for the taking of private land by a municipality for public use (US Const, 5th Amdt; NY Const, art I, &sect; 7).  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) which reversed the order of the trial court which had denied respondents' motion to vacate an ex parte order authorizing appellant to utilize transcripts from a grand jury proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had signed an ex parte order allowing appellant to utilize grand jury minutes. Respondents had filed a motion before the trial court to vacate the order but it was denied. Respondents then sought review of the denial. The lower court granted respondents' motion and vacated the ex parte order. Appellant sought review of the order to vacate. The court affirmed. The court found that respondents had standing to challenge the ex parte order since all of the respondents were targets of the grand jury investigation and thus had a legitimate interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the grand jury proceedings. The court held that the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings was essential, and disclosure of the proceedings would only be allowed if the one seeking disclosure demonstrated a compelling and particularized need for access.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The rule of secrecy of Grand Jury proceedings applies equally to one who gives evidence and one concerning whom evidence is given and, accordingly, respondents, who were all targets of a Grand Jury inquiry, had standing to challenge an order allowing disclosure of the Grand Jury proceedings to the District Attorney for use in connection with a civil action against them by the county, although some of the individual respondents did not testify because they would not waive immunity; further, those respondents whose Grand Jury testimony was allegedly perjurious or was subsequently found to be perjurious did not forfeit their legitimate interest in maintaining the confidentiality of any other accusations leveled against them.  Finally, although some of the Grand Jury testimony was revealed in connection with intervening litigation after the initial disclosure order was issued, respondents' appeal has not become moot, since further disclosure and dissemination of Grand Jury testimony can be prevented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Grand Jury -- Inspection of Grand Jury Minutes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An ex parte order granting an application by the District Attorney to utilize Grand Jury minutes in aid of a civil suit by the county to recover damages for alleged fraud on the taxpayers by respondents, who had been the targets of the Grand Jury inquiry into possible fraud and corruption in the construction of a sewer project, was properly vacated, since the District Attorney failed to make the requisite initial showing of a compelling and particularized need for access sufficient to overcome the presumption of confidentiality of Grand Jury proceedings ( CPL 190.25, subd 4); the District Attorney's conclusory allegation that access was required in order to pursue the litigation left the court without any rationale by which it could minimize any invasion of secrecy by narrowing the scope of the disclosure and did not indicate why the Grand Jury minutes were essential to the pursuit of the county's efforts to recover civil damages from respondents for the alleged fraud, e.g., nothing was offered to explain why discovery devices would not suffice. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) that affirmed his conviction for criminal possession of a controlled substance in the second-degree. Defendant alleged that a &quot;no-knock&quot; entry by police to execute a search warrant was a violation of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction for possession of a controlled substance in the second-degree. Defendant alleged that a &quot;no-knock&quot; search of his home violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. IV. Defendant came under suspicion of the police for drug possession, and the police contacted a magistrate for a &quot;no-knock&quot; warrant to search the premises of defendant's home. Defendant's home was searched, and drugs were found after officers entered the premises by knocking down a side door. The warrant was never delivered, and the officers conducting the search were not in actual possession of the warrant at the time of the search. The court determined that although the officers lacked actual possession of the warrant, defendant was not denied the protection of the warrant requirement, because the police did go through the procedure to obtain the warrant, including evaluation of probable cause by a magistrate. The court therefore affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Police officers with knowledge that a warrant authorizing the search of a suspect's home has been issued and is en route may enter those premises before the warrant arrives.  Accordingly, where a search warrant was obtained by the police from a magistrate who had determined that probable cause did exist to enter and search defendant's home, and it was not until the warrant designating the place to be searched and the contraband to be seized arrived that a search of the premises was conducted, the entry by the police prior to the arrival of a detective with the warrant did not violate defendant's constitutional rights against unreasonable search and seizure. Moreover, inasmuch as the warrant issued by the magistrate pursuant to CPL 690.50 (subd 2) authorized the police &quot;to enter the premises to be searched without giving notice of your authority and purpose&quot; and since the officers who initially entered defendant's house had been informed that a &quot;no-knock&quot; warrant had been issued, their unannounced entry was entirely proper.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with violation of Village of Monticello, N.Y., Code &sect; 39-3, which prohibited possession in a public place of an open or unsealed container of an alcoholic beverage.

After concluding that defendant was not precluded from appealing his conviction based on the unconstitutionality of the ordinance under which he was convicted, despite his guilty plea, the court held that the village's ordinance, which prohibited mere possession in a public place of an open or unsealed container of an alcoholic beverage, without requiring proof of any intent to consume, was an exercise of police power for which there existed no reasonable relation to the public good.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A defendant by a plea of guilty does not forfeit the right on appeal from the conviction to challenge the constitutionality of the statute under which he was convicted. Although a guilty plea constitutes an effective judicial admission by a defendant that he committed the acts charged in the accusatory instrument, such a plea is in no way inconsistent with the contention that, conceding commission of all the acts charged, the provision of statute or ordinance which proscribes the particular conduct as criminal is nonetheless unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

A village ordinance prohibiting mere possession in a public place of an open or unsealed container of an alcoholic beverage, without requiring proof of any intent to consume, is unconstitutional.  While reasonable regulation of the possession of alcoholic beverages might be upheld in the name of the police power, outright proscription as criminal of possession only of a container of an alcoholic beverage has not been shown to bear a reasonable relation to the public good; moreover, the condition of openness in itself in no way threatens the public good, and, while a container must of course be opened or unsealed to permit consumption, it cannot be presumed that every opening or unsealing is for the purpose of direct human consumption or least of all for the purpose of direct human consumption in a public place. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, County Court Judges, Family Court Judges, and Surrogates, challenged the decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York), which reversed and granted judgment in favor of respondents, State and Chief Administrator of the Courts, dismissed the complaint against the State, and declared the Unified Court Budget Act constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judges claimed that the Unified Court Budget Act denied them equal protection insofar as it provided higher salaries for Judges of co-ordinate jurisdiction in certain counties in the New York City metropolitan area. Judges sought a declaration that they were entitled to retroactive salary increments to compensate them for the discrepancies. The court held that the State was a proper party to the challenge to the constitutionality of the statute and the motion to dismiss the complaint against the State for lack of jurisdiction should have been denied. The court held that there were State-wide disparities in population, caseload, and cost of living, which provided a rational basis for the Legislature to adopt price differentials for those serving in different areas of the State, and the statute passed constitutional muster under the equal protection challenge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reinstated the complaints against the State in order to declare in favor of the State as well as the other defendants, and as modified affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Proper Parties</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Although claims against the State primarily seeking money damages should be brought in the Court of Claims, the State is a proper party to a declaratory judgment action in the Supreme Court because of its obvious interest in the right to be heard on the matters concerning the constitutionality of its statutes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judges -- Disparity in Judicial Salaries</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A State budgetary act will not be struck as violative of equal protection merely because it creates differences in geographic areas; the Unified Court Budget Act (L 1976, ch 966; L 1979, ch 55; L 1980, ch 881) is not violative of equal protection insofar as plaintiff Judges residing in various counties across the State are provided lower salaries than those received by Judges of co-ordinate jurisdiction in certain counties in the New York City metropolitan area, since there are State-wide disparities in population, caseload and cost of living, which provide a rational basis for the Legislature to adopt price differentials for those Judges serving in different areas of the State.  Nor does equal protection require that all classifications be made with mathematical precision, and, as such, the fact that the general statutory scheme, when applied on a State-wide basis, may produce some inequities for certain Judges within a particular class does not render the statute unconstitutional. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 828 of the Executive Law is not only a valid exercise of the police power, but also authorizes the payment of compensation for crossover and noncrossover installation of cable television facilities, as fixed by the Commission on Cable Television, subject to review. Section 828 (subd 1, par b) of the Executive Law authorizes the commission to limit by regulation the highest amount a property owner may receive, unless on application by the property owner to the commission that body, after a hearing, fixes a higher sum as the reasonable compensation for the particular property, and the commission's regulations are entirely consistent with its being so empowered, and are fully compatible with the usual process of adjudication; nor have section 828 procedures been superseded by the provisions of the Eminent Domain Procedure Law. Additionally, neither the Federal nor State Constitution proscribes determination for a taking by a commission rather than a court.  Nevertheless, the commission's regulations providing a limitation upon presentation of a claim (9 NYCRR 598.3), framed in the context of a police power rather than a condemnation statute, could be construed by the commission to bar claims as to which an owner did not in fact have notice in time to comply with the regulation, and, as such, should be declared invalid.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to attempted robbery in the second degree, and the remaining indicted charges were dismissed. The court imposed a sentence of imprisonment for a term of one to three years under N. Y. Penal Law &sect; 70.02 (subd. 5, par [b]). The statute allowed consideration for sentencing of the charges upon which the defendant had been indicted but which were dismissed as part of the plea bargain. The defendant sought a reduced sentence on the basis of mitigating circumstances. His application was denied on the ground that the circumstances did not, as required by section 70.02, bear upon the manner in which the crime was committed, and defendant sought relief. On appeal the court held that the statute did not violate due process because it did not involve a new finding of fact on a distinct issue as the basis for increased punishment. Instead the statute required a defendant who was indicted for an armed felony but pled to a lesser offense, to be sentenced to an indeterminate term, absent a showing of mitigation.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">There is no due process infirmity under either the Federal or the State Constitution in the requirement of subdivision 5 of section 70.02 of the Penal Law that a defendant who has been charged with an armed felony and permitted in satisfaction of the indictment to plead guilty to a class D violent felony must receive an indeterminate sentence of one to three years unless the court finds that factors specified in the section warrant imposition of less than an indeterminate sentence. The statute does not improperly subject defendant to enhanced punishment on the basis of the unproven charge that he was &quot;armed&quot; within the meaning of the &quot;armed felony&quot; definition since the statute does not give preclusive effect to the indictment's allegation that defendant was armed, notwithstanding the fact that there are differences in the sentencing discretion available when a defendant has pleaded guilty under an indictment charging an armed felony and what would be available had there been no armed felony charge.  Nor does paragraph (c) improperly place upon the defendant the burden of proving one or more of the ameliorating factors referred to in subdivision (b) in violation of due process; by pleading to the class D violent felony, the defendant in effect admits for the purpose of sentence and subject to his right to a lesser sentence if the existence of one of the ameliorating factors be found by the court, that he was armed as charged, and any new facts found in the postplea presentence hearing can only reduce, not enhance, the punishment imposed; additionally, due process is not offended by the probability that in most cases establishment of an ameliorative factor will require that defendant come forward with proof.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant district attorney challenged an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department, New York, which reversed respondent's conviction for manslaughter and robbery, each in the first degree, vacated his guilty plea, granted his motion to suppress certain statements, and remitted case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, with advice and in presence of counsel, voluntarily furnished appellant, district attorney, an incriminating statement prior to entering into a plea bargain and, subsequent to his guilty plea and conviction, voluntarily testified against a codefendant. Thereafter, respondent appealed his convictions for manslaughter and robbery, each in the first degree, seeking to preclude appellant from using those statements against him at a subsequent trial ordered by the Appellate Division following suppression of statements made by respondent at the time of his arrest. The appellate division reversed respondent's convictions, vacated his guilty plea, and granted his motion to suppress the statements. Appellant challenged. The court reversed, finding that the evidence did not need to be suppressed since the voluntary guilty plea provided insulating attenuation to the illegally procured initial statement, and neither the integrity of the plea bargaining process or fundamental fairness required suppression of the statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order was reversed and remitted; respondent could not retract plea bargain or suppress admissions made pursuant thereto because integrity of plea bargaining process and balanced fundamental fairness permitted use of evidence where appellant complied with plea bargain, and respondent failed to condition plea with non-admissibility of his future testimony against codefendant.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, who voluntarily made an incriminating statement to the District Attorney with the advice and in the presence of counsel before entering into a plea bargain initiated by defendant and, after his conviction upon his plea of guilty to reduced charges, voluntarily testified against a codefendant at two trials, was not entitled to suppression of the preplea statement or the in-court testimony at a new trial ordered by the Appellate Division following suppression of incriminating statements defendant made at the time of his arrest, where neither defendant nor his attorney expressed as a condition of the pleas that statements made pursuant thereto could be withdrawn upon a successful appeal of his motion to suppress the statements made at the time of his arrest; the evidence need not be suppressed as fruit of a poisonous tree, although the illegally obtained initial confessions preceded the preplea statement and the trial testimony, since the interposing of a voluntary guilty plea, based upon defendant's assessment of the case, provided insulating attenuation to the illegally procured initial statement.  Furthermore,  as a matter of policy and fundamental fairness, exclusion of evidence of defendant's original guilty plea provides all of the protection necessary to assure that the court's decision to allow defendant to withdraw that plea is a meaningful one as required by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Spitaleri</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (9 NY2d 168). </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbing an art student at gunpoint, after he and several of his companions pushed the student into the vestibule of a building and took the student's money. During jury selection, defendant moved for a mistrial, contending that the prosecutor had unlawfully exercised her peremptory challenges to exclude all of the blacks and the only Hispanic prospective juror drawn from the jury pool. The trial court denied defendant's motion, and, after his conviction, defendant appealed. The intermediate court affirmed. Defendant appealed again, but the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that the prosecutor's motives for exercising a peremptory challenge were not subject to scrutiny for potential racial bias. The court further held that the New York constitution's requirement that defendant be tried by a jury of his peers did not offer broader protection to defendant than the scope of the federal Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs District Attorneys filed three separate actions against defendants three New York Counties seeking compensation in accordance with N.Y. Jud. Law &sect;183-a. The Counties alleged that &sect; 183-a was unconstitutional. The actions were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 183-a required that District Attorneys in certain counties be paid at the same salary level as county court judges. A separate statute required that county court judge's' salaries be gradually increased. The Counties did not also gradually increase the District Attorneys' salaries. The Counties argued that &sect; 183-a violated N.Y. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 7, which provided that a state officer's compensation was fixed by law and was not to be increased or decreased during the officer's term of office and that N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 183-a violated N.Y. Const. art. IX that gave broad powers of home rule to local governing bodies. The court determined that the District Attorneys were not state officers but local officers, so that they were not subject to N.Y. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 7. The court found that the adoption of N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 183-a did not violate the Counties' home rule authority because the home rule provisions did not restrict the legislature from acting upon matters of state concern. Maintaining the security and independence of the District Attorneys and assuring that persons of high standing and integrity remained in that position were matters of state concern.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 183-a was not unconstitutional. The lower courts' judgments entered on behalf of the District Attorneys were affirmed. The judgment entered on behalf of the County was reversed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">District and Prosecuting Attorneys -- Statutory Compensation Plan</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 183-a of the Judiciary Law, which divides counties into classes based on population and requires that full-time District Attorneys in counties with a certain population be paid the same salary as County Court Judges in their counties, is not in conflict with the home rule provisions of article IX of the New York Constitution, since the statutory classification is reasonable and the statute is related to a proper area of State concern, i.e., maintaining the quality and integrity of District Attorneys, who are responsible for enforcing the Penal Law and representing the people of the State in criminal matters arising within the counties; furthermore, section 7 of article XIII of the New York Constitution, which prohibits midterm increases in the salaries of State officers, does not bar such increases for District Attorneys, who should no longer be considered State officers within the meaning of said constitutional provision.  Accordingly, petitioners, full-time District Attorneys in Clinton, Dutchess and Ontario Counties, are entitled to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of section 183-a prospectively and retroactively to the date at which the counties ceased paying salaries equivalent to those of the County Court Judges (Judiciary Law, &sect; 221-d).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">District and Prosecuting Attorneys -- Compensation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The power granted to local governments over the compensation of their officers under section 2 (subd [c], par [ii], cl [1]) of article IX of the New York Constitution is limited to the enactment of local laws which are not inconsistent with any general law relating to that subject.  Accordingly, inasmuch as section 183-a of the Judiciary Law, which sets minimum salaries for full-time District Attorneys in certain counties, is a valid State enactment on this subject, it may not be superseded by conflicting local legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">District and Prosecuting Attorneys -- Compensation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 201 of the County Law, which places the authority to fix the salaries of officers paid from county funds in the board of supervisors, must be deemed impliedly repealed by the later enacted section 183-a of the Judiciary Law, which sets minimum salaries for full-time District Attorneys in certain counties, but only to the extent that the two laws are in conflict.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed this paternity action more than six years after her child was born. The family court denied the putative father's motion to dismiss the matter as untimely under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 517(a). However, the lower appellate court granted the motion and held that the proceeding was barred because it was not commenced within 2 years of the last of the 39 separate support payments that the putative father made. On appeal, the court reversed the lower appellate court's order and reinstated the order of the family court in favor of the mother. The court held that, when a putative father acknowledged paternity either in writing or through the furnishing of support payments, the time within which a paternity proceeding had to be brought was not restricted by any statutory limitation. The court rejected the putative father's contention that the acknowledgement of paternity served only to start the two-year statutory period running anew.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When a putative father has acknowledged paternity either in writing or through the furnishing of support payments, the time within which a paternity proceeding must be brought is not restricted by any statutory limitation. Subdivision (a) of section 517 of the Family Court Act, which establishes a general two-year limitation period for bringing such proceedings, expressly excepts situations when paternity has been acknowledged by the father, stating no new limit when the extension is founded upon this ground; in the absence of a legislative directive limiting the time within which the revived paternity proceeding must be brought, however, and in light of the strong public policy that obligates a parent to support his or her child, there exists no basis to hold that acknowledgment serves only to renew the statute of limitations; nor would a putative father be prejudiced by exposure to stale claims, because he may still seek the protection of the statute by controverting the basis for his payments, and recent advances in blood typing provide strong defenses; additionally, the father's affirmative acts of acknowledgment themselves argue against claims of surprise or prejudice.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant law assistants challenged an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed a judgment of the New York County Supreme Court at Special Term (New York) in favor of respondents, court administrators and fiscal officers, declaring that the new salary system was not unconstitutional or a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state assumed the law assistants' salaries under the Unified Court Budget Act of 1976. All clerks in trial level courts, whether previously paid by the state or city, were assigned a grade based on when they were admitted to the bar. The law assistants, previously paid by the city, received a lower salary than some prior state-paid clerks with the same length of service. The trial court concluded that respondents properly computed salaries and were not arbitrary or capricious, and it found no equal protection violation. The appellate court affirmed, holding that the state had a rational basis for the classification and finding that no one incurred any salary loss. On review, the court asserted that there was an adequate factual basis for different conversion methods to integrate court employees onto the unified budget. The court noted that individual evaluations that would otherwise be necessary were eliminated, and the former city employees retained superior benefits. The court concluded that where significant fiscal concerns and proper court administration existed, it would not strike legislation merely because it created geographic distinctions. The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order, which declared that the new salary system for law assistants was not unconstitutional, that the law assistants were not denied equal protection, that respondents did not act in an arbitrary or capricious manner or contrary to law, and that respondents were not required to pay the law assistants the increased salaries they sought.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Unified Court System -- Disparity in Salaries of Law Assistants</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The provisions of sections 37 and 39 of the Judiciary Law, which establish the method of computing salaries for nonjudicial personnel serving in the Unified Court System, do not violate petitioners'  right to equal protection of the law, although said provisions result in a disparity between the salaries received by petitioners, law assistants formerly paid by the City of New York, and some of the law assistants previously paid by the State with the same number of years of service, and although they also produce salary disparities among law assistants in different geographic areas; the fiscal restraints placed on the State provide a rational basis for the statutory classification, which provides a direct transition for State-paid employees into the incremental salary system based on years of service and incorporates employees formerly paid by local government by using their prior salary as a guide to placement in the incremental system.  Furthermore, since respondent court administrators and fiscal officers acted in accordance with the dictates of section 39 of the Judiciary Law, which did not allow them any range of discretion on petitioners' salary increment assignments, it cannot be said that their actions were arbitrary or capricious.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff worker sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which granted defendant Workers' Compensation Board's motion for summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A worker brought suit seeking a judgment declaring the fee restrictions of N.Y. Workers' Comp. Law &sect; 24&nbsp;unconstitutional because they effectively prevented her from retaining skilled legal counsel of her choice to pursue her compensation claim. The worker's counsel had been required to refund his retainer to the worker because such a fee arrangement was restricted by &sect; 24. The court rejected the challenge, finding that requiring that attorneys' fees sought in connection with a claim arising under that law must have been approved by the board, was a reasonable regulation of the payment of attorneys' fees. The court reasoned that the law was enacted for the protection of the worker and did not violate the worker's constitutional rights to due process or equal protection. The court found that the worker's interest in entering into a particular fee arrangement or indeed, choosing a particular attorney to represent her was not the sort of personal decision encompassed within the &quot;zone of privacy.&quot; The court further ruled that the challenged classification, burdened no suspect group and affected no interest deemed fundamental, needed only pass the constitutional test of rationality.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Attorneys' Fees in Compensation Cases</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 24 of the Workers' Compensation Law, requiring that attorneys' fees sought in connection with a claim arising under that law must be approved by the Workers' Compensation Board, is a reasonable regulation of the payment of attorneys' fees, enacted for the protection of the claimant, and does not violate a claimant's constitutional rights to due process or equal protection. Section 18 of article I of the New York Constitution, empowering the Legislature to enact laws to compensate injured employees, lays to rest all State constitutional attacks on the workers' compensation laws falling within its scope.  Nor does section 24, in limiting plaintiff's ability to choose an attorney on her own terms, violate her constitutional right of privacy derived from the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by interfering in the &quot;fundamentally private relationship&quot; between attorney and client, since her choice of legal representation involves nothing more than an economic decision and is not the sort of personal decision encompassed in the &quot;zone of privacy&quot;.  Moreover, even though the fee restrictions are directed only to claimants and not to employers and compensation carriers, such a classification has a rational basis and is not violative of equal protection,  inasmuch as the restriction on a claimant's choice of counsel is a reasonable method of furthering the legislative objectives of the Workers' Compensation Law by ensuring adequate economic relief to the employee or his family.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for violating a local noise control ordinance. The appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the ordinance was unconstitutional for vagueness. The court determined that the ordinance was a ready candidate for discriminatory enforcement, and the ordinance's defects could not be remedied by narrowing the construction of the ordinance. The court determined that the ordinance's prohibition on loading or unloading any vehicle so as to create unnecessary noise within 300 feet of the boundary lines of a residential district during nighttime hours was vague, since it contained an additional phrase indicating that the prohibition was not limited to its specific language. The court concluded that the statute's 10 standards to be considered in determining whether unnecessary noise existed was vague, since it failed to provide guidance on terms, such as &quot;intensity,&quot; &quot;proximity,&quot; &quot;duration,&quot; &quot;time,&quot; and other subjective concepts.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A town noise control ordinance which imposes criminal liability upon violators is not pre-emptive of or inconsistent with State law (Penal Law, &sect; 240.45); local governments have been given broad authority to adopt ordinances governing the safety, health and well-being of those within their jurisdictions (Municipal Home Rule Law, &sect; 10) and, under subdivision 11 of section 130 of the Town Law, towns have received specific authority to regulate noise in their communities, indicating that the State did not intend to reserve the regulation of noise to itself.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Unnecessary Noise Control Ordinance of the Town of Poughkeepsie is unconstitutional, since the vagueness of the definitions of the conduct prohibited therein fails to provide a defendant with adequate warning of what the law requires and renders the ordinance susceptible to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. Accordingly, a judgment convicting defendant corporation, which owns and operates a quarry, of making &quot;unnecessary noise&quot;, defined to include any &quot;excessive or unusually loud sound or any sound which either annoys, disturbs, injures or endangers the comfort, repose, health, peace or safety of a person&quot;, and &quot;loading or unloading * * * [a] vehicle * * * so as to create unnecessary noise at the adjoining property line&quot; in violation of said ordinance, is reversed and the informations against defendant are dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court held that &sect; 369(1)(b) did not constitute a denial of equal protection. The court held that although there was no recoupment requirement with respect to benefits paid to those under the age of 65, the difference in treatment of the two groups had a rational basis and the two classes were circumstantially different in significant respects.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought reversal of the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York) upholding two sodomy convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with multiple counts of sodomy. After his arrest, he gave several incriminating statements to the police, which he unsuccessfully sought to suppress. He was then granted separate trials on each sodomy count, but at his trials evidence of the other alleged crimes was admitted. After his convictions were affirmed by an intermediate appellate court, defendant sought and was granted review by the state's highest court. That court also affirmed his convictions, reasoning as follows: (a) defendant's void-for-vagueness challenge to the sodomy statute was rejected because forcible compulsion was an unambiguous concept; (b) evidence of defendant's other alleged acts of sodomy were properly admitted to prove his identity because that identification was in dispute and because the jury was admonished as to limited purpose of the evidence; and (c) custodial statements were admissible because defendant had consulted with counsel prior to his interrogation and had voluntarily consented to speak with police.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of convictions. The sodomy statute was not unconstitutionally vague, the use of similar crimes evidence was permissible in order to show defendant's identity, and defendant's custodial statements were admissible because the statements were given after a valid waiver of rights and after consultation with counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Identification of Defendant -- Proof of Other Crimes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Evidence of similar homosexual assaults allegedly committed by defendant was properly admitted, with appropriate limiting instructions, for the purpose of establishing defendant's identity at his trial on charges of sodomy, where the validity of the complainant's identification of defendant was challenged on cross-examination and through defendant's testimony, and defendant's </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">modus operandi</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> was sufficiently unique to tend to establish his identity, as each of the other four assault victims testified to the same initial ruse to lure him to an isolated area, three testified to being told the same story that defendant was from out of town and, with the exception of one man who managed to fight his assailant, each of them described the same pattern of French kissing, oral and anal sodomy during the actual assault; the fact that other identification evidence was introduced at trial does not bar evidence of similar crimes under the identification exception since the issue remained in dispute, and, although other homosexual attacks might follow the same scenario as those described, the pattern used by defendant was sufficiently distinctive to make evidence of the other attacks probative of the assailant's identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Counsel -- Right to Remain Silent</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress statements linking him to the crimes charged, made after he agreed, on the advice of his attorney, to be questioned by police without the attorney present, and after this decision was confirmed in a telephone conversation between the interrogating officer and defendant's attorney, as defendant validly waived his right to remain silent on the advice of counsel; the police had no obligation to ensure that the initial communication between the attorney and his client,  wherein defendant misinformed the attorney about the nature of the incident under investigation, was open and honest, or to seek some independent assurance that defendant's decision to waive his right to remain silent and to have his attorney present was based on good advice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sodomy -- Forcible Compulsion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Subdivision 8 of section 130.00 of the Penal Law, which defines &quot;forcible compulsion&quot; as that term is used for purposes of establishing sex offenses under article 130 of the Penal Law, is not unconstitutionally vague; although forcible compulsion is an abstract concept, the statute cannot be termed ambiguous.  Accordingly, defendant's convictions of sodomy in the first degree are affirmed, where there was adequate evidence in both cases that the defendant used physical force and intimidation to establish the requisite element of forcible compulsion. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In a proceeding brought to declare unconstitutional that portion of subdivision 2 of section 8-100 of the Election Law which provided for longer primary election voting hours in 10 selected counties of the State, an order of the Appellate Division, which reversed a judgment declaring said statute unconstitutional and ordering all primary places to be open from noon to 9:00 p.m., and declared that the statute did not violate petitioners' equal protection rights, is affirmed for reasons stated in the opinion at the Appellate Division, which concluded that the case did not involve an abridgment of the fundamental right to vote so as to require a heightened level of scrutiny of the distinctions involved, but merely concerned the hours of primary voting, which may be the subject of valid State regulation; that the appropriate standard of review was the rational basis test, and that under such standard, the statute is constitutional since the Legislature's presumed consideration and evaluation of the voting problems in the 10 counties (i.e., overcrowding during the evening hours) provided a rational basis for the different voting hours, and petitioners failed to show that the underlying legislative judgment was irrational.  In a similar case, a judgment of the Supreme Court, which declared the subject statute unconstitutional and ordered all primary polling places in the State to be open from 6:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m., as in the 10 counties, is reversed and the statute declared constitutional.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An unfavorable salary disparity existed between the judges and the judges of the only other district in the state.

The appellate court modified the judgment by making the target date April 1982 and affirmed the judgment. Both parties appealed from that ruling. The court modified the order to reinstate the earlier date and, as modified, affirmed the judgment. The court held that (1) while equal protection did not necessarily require territorial uniformity, a territorial distinction that had no rational basis would not support a state statute; (2) the historical differential between the salaries did not interdict the judges' equal protection claim; (3) there was no rational basis for the geographical classification used by the state to support its defense of the disparate judicial salaries; (4) the judges' rights accrued in October 1978 because deferral to a later date would vitiate the relief for those judges who retired on or after that date and the remedy had to be coextensive with the wrong it was to redress.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The wage disparity between plaintiff Judges of the Suffolk County District Court and the Judges of the only other District Court in the State, that of adjoining Nassau County, represents an unconstitutional impairment of plaintiffs' rights to equal protection of the laws (NY Const, art I, &sect; 11; US Const, 14th Amdt), as there is no rational basis for the geographic classification on which the salary disparity is grounded.  Furthermore, plaintiffs are entitled to judgment for the differentials between their salaries and those paid to Nassau County District Court Judges from October 1, 1978, which is the appropriate date from which to measure the accrual of plaintiffs' rights, since the Legislature acted on the subject of District Court Judges' salaries in 1979 in legislation that was retroactively effective to said date, but failed to eliminate the unconstitutional disparity in the salaries of Judges of the District Courts (Judiciary Law, &sect; 221-f).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent guardians of children filed petitions for the termination of the children's parents' rights due to the parents' mental illnesses. The appellate division terminated the parental rights of one parent, determining that there was clear and convincing proof that he was presently and for the foreseeable future, by reason of mental illness, unable to provide adequate and proper care for his two children. The appellate division also determined that there was clear and convincing proof of mental illness that rendered a mother unable to provide adequate supervision and guidance to her children in the foreseeable future, and terminated her parental rights. The appellate division also concluded that N.Y. Soc. Serv.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In two proceedings to terminate parental rights pursuant to section 384-b (subd 4, par [c]) of the Social Services Law on the ground of mental illness, orders of the Appellate Division modifying orders which, in one proceeding, dismissed a petition to terminate the parental rights of respondent father and, in the other proceeding, denied a petition to terminate the parental rights of respondent mother, by declaring that section 384-b (subd 4, par [c]; subd 6, par [a]) of the Social Services Law is constitutional and terminating the parental rights of the father and mother on the ground of mental illness, are affirmed.  There is clear and convincing proof that each parent is presently and for the foreseeable future unable, by reason of mental illness, to provide proper and adequate care for the children; consequently, there is no basis for disturbing the Appellate Division's findings that there exists mental illness sufficient to justify termination of parental rights. There is no merit to the parents' arguments that the statutory scheme violates rights of procedural and substantive due process and equal protection and authorizes termination of rights on the basis of a parent's status as mentally ill, since the statutes provide significant procedural safeguards for the natural parent's rights and authorize termination only when specific and definite criteria are met and when necessary in the best interest of the child, and it is the parent's conduct and relationship with the child, not his or her status per se, that forms the predicate for terminating parental rights. </SPAN></P>

Other boards, the officials, and taxpayer's intervened. The challenged system permitted the expenditure at the local level of funds collected in each county through property taxes. The appellate division modified the judgment of the trial court, finding, in part, that the scheme violated the equal protection clause of the New York Constitution, but not that of the federal constitution. On appeal, the court modified and held that the system of local funding to public school districts was constitutional. The financing scheme did not violate the equal protection clause of either the New York State Constitution or the federal constitution because the preservation and promotion of local control of education was both a legitimate state interest and one to which the present financing system was reasonably related.

The existing provisions for State aid to finance public education in this State do not violate the equal protection clause contained in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, notwithstanding disparities in per pupil expenditures among the State's school districts, resulting largely from the differences in the revenue available for educational purposes in consequence of unequal real property tax bases or unequal demands on local revenue.  Applying the rational basis standard of equal protection review, no impermissible discrimination against pupils in the less property-wealthy districts is found, there being a rational relationship to a legitimate State purpose, here the permission and encouragement of participation in and control of public schools at the local district level.  Nor does the present school finance system discriminate against large city school districts, since inequalities existing in cities are the product of demographic, economic and political factors intrinsic to the cities themselves, and cannot be attributed to legislative action or inaction.</SPAN></P>

Applying the rational basis standard of judicial review, the present school financing system has not been shown to be without a rational basis, since the justification for such system, the preservation and promotion of local control of education, is both a legitimate State interest and one to which the present financing system is reasonably related; any legislative attempt to make uniform and undeviating the educational opportunities offered by the several hundred local school districts would inevitably work the demise of local control of education available to students in individual districts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Church owned and operated as landlord approximately 60 residential apartments. When church insisted that tenants enter into new leases at rents higher than those permitted by rent stabilization, tenants filed complaints. The court held that had the legislature intended to extend the exemption to religious institutions, it could have chosen to do so through appropriately worded legislation. The court held that in view of the legislature's failure to include religious institutions generally within the exemption provisions of the statute, an irrefutable inference arose that housing accommodations owned or operated by religious institutions were outside the scope of the statute. The court held that the issue involving tenant's claim for attorneys' fees should be remitted for further consideration as to whether the church's refusal to offer renewal leases in rent-stabilized terms constituted a failure to perform a covenant or agreement as was requisite to the application of N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Residential apartments owned and operated by a religious institution and rented to the general public are not exempt from the rent stabilization laws.  Section 5 (subd a, par [6]) of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act, exempting from rent stabilization housing accommodations owned or operated by any institution operated exclusively for charitable or educational purposes on a nonprofit basis, contains no language which would permit an interpretation providing a similar exemption for institutions operated for religious purposes; nor does the statutory reference to monastery or convent serve to define religious institutions generally.  Accordingly, the apartments in question being subject to rent stabilization, the matter must be remitted for a determination as to whether the landlord's refusal to offer renewal leases at rent-stabilized terms constituted a failure to perform a covenant or agreement so as to entitle petitioners to attorneys' fees pursuant to section 234 of the Real Property Law.  </SPAN></P>

Regarding the procedure necessary to commence an action pursuant to section 139 of the Highway Law, that statute defers to section 50-e of the General Municipal Law, subdivision 4 of which specifically allows for the enactment of prior notification statutes and requires compliance with such laws, making no distinction between general and local laws; similarly, section 139 of the Highway Law contains no provision limiting the applicability of section 50-e of the General Municipal Law or barring local laws which impose conditions precedent to maintaining an action against a county.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which modified and affirmed an order and judgment of the trial court in a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 to annul determinations of respondent reducing regulated rents for petitioners' apartments and to declare unconstitutional, subdivision b of section 9 of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners argued that as to leases they entered into with tenants prior to the adoption by the Board of Trustees of the Village of Freeport of a resolution declaring the existence of an emergency pursuant to subdivision a of section 3 of the Emergency Tenant Protection Act of 1974 (ETPA), the act, to the extent that it required a refund of so much of the rent paid prior to the date of adoption of the resolution as was in excess of the fair market rent determined after such adoption was an unconstitutional impairment of contract in violation of section 10 of article I of the United States Constitution. Petitioners argued further that they were entitled to a hearing on comparable rents as related to the establishment of the fair market rent for the housing units involved. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that neither argument withstands analysis. Each of the leases in question was made after passage of the ETPA. Every lease entered into after the effective date of the ETPA was, therefore, subject to the power of the state reserved by that provision to itself and to the municipalities to require that rent paid under such a lease be refunded.</SPAN></P>

Every lease entered into after the effective date of the EPTA, such as those at bar, was subject to the power of the State and those municipalities authorized to determine the need for emergency rent regulation, to require that the rent paid under such leases be refunded to the extent that the rent exceeded the fair market value since the challenged statute expressly provides that where the State housing agency has determined that a rent charged was &quot;excessive&quot;, it shall order a refund of any excess paid after January 1, 1974 or the date of the commencement of the tenancy, whichever was later, and, inasmuch as petitioners' apartments were &quot;an enterprise already regulated in the particular&quot; to which they now object at the time the leases in question were made, the &quot;retroactivity&quot; which petitioners claim invalidates the refund requirement as to them under the contract clause of the United States Constitution simply does not exist; petitioners, landlords, were not entitled to a hearing as to the comparability of the &quot;excessive&quot; rents since they made no application for one within the 60-day limitations period set forth in subdivision a of section 9 of the ETPA.  </SPAN></P>

The statute does not violate plaintiff's right of equal protection and due process of law; it does not interfere with his freedom to marry, because its focus is on marital relationships, not status.  Nor, simply because it precludes him from sitting as a director of one savings and loan institution, does it interfere with his right to pursue his chosen profession; moreover, the statute is a rational exercise of the State's police power, reasonably calculated to achieve its goal of eliminating nepotism in the savings and loan industry. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parent challenged the lower court's decision to affirm the trial court's determination that he was unfit to raise his child and claimed that his parental rights were improperly terminated. The court reversed the decision of the lower court and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The court held that appellant's unfitness simply was not one of the findings that would have supported an order of termination under N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 384-b(4). Termination of appellant's parental rights had to be predicated upon one or more of the grounds specifically enumerated in &sect; 384-b(4), none of which included unfitness, and therefore such termination was improperly based on a finding of unfitness alone. Appellee, Department of Social Services, needed to support its allegations through clear and convincing evidence of abandonment, inability to care for the child due to mental illness or retardation, permanent neglect, or severe or repeated child abuse.</SPAN></P>

A habeas corpus proceeding to obtain custody of a child is not an appropriate substitute for a proceeding under section 384-b of the Social Services Law, which may be originated only by an authorized agency or foster parent who serves a petition on notice to the parent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, chairman of the board, senior manager, and director, were charged with felonies under N.Y. Banking Law &sect; 673. The trial court convicted the chairman of the board and the senior manager of misapplication of bank funds and conspiracy. The director entered a plea of guilty to misapplication of bank funds. The Supreme Court of New York, Appellate Division, affirmed. The chairman of the board, senior manager, and director appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chairman of the board, senior manager, and director, on various occasions, authorized deposits of bank funds and extensions of credit to customers, which exceeded the limits imposed by N.Y. Banking Law &sect;&sect; 103, 106. The bank did not suffer losses on any of the transactions, and none of the convicted bank officers made any profit on or otherwise had any personal pecuniary interest in the transactions. On appeal, the court reversed the convictions. The court held that there was no basis for the charges that the chairman of the board, senior manager, and director willfully misapplied the bank's funds and credit because they acted solely in their positions as officers and directors of the bank without any suggestion of personal profit. &quot;Wilful misapplication&quot; required some form of self-dealing or some benefit to the accused's commercial and material interests. For an individual to be convicted under N.Y. Banking Law &sect; 673, the State was required to allege and prove some personal pecuniary interest in the transactions, which was more than the simple benefits flowing from the gratitude of a well-served client or owner of the bank.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">A bank officer or employee who, without more, extends to a bank customer credit in amounts exceeding civil limits is not guilty of feloniously misapplying bank funds within the meaning of section 673 of the Banking Law; wilful misapplication of bank funds, as that term is used in the statute, requires that the offender have a personal pecuniary interest in the transactions before criminal liability will attach.  Accordingly, convictions of defendant bank officers and directors under an indictment charging that defendants knowingly violated sections 103 and 106 of the Banking Law in that, on various occasions, they authorized deposits of bank funds in other banks and extensions of credit to bank customers which exceeded the limits imposed by sections 103 and 106 of the Banking Law, are reversed, where the bank suffered no losses on any of the transactions, and none of the defendants made any profit on or otherwise had any personal pecuniary interest in the transactions.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was born after his father died in a job related incident. Through his unmarried mother, the claimant filed for death benefits. The mother disclosed her pregnancy to the deceased on the day of his death. The board denied the claim, finding that the claimant was not acknowledged by the decedent as his child and could not receive benefits. The claimant challenged the determination on the ground that N.Y. Work. Comp. Law &sect; 2(11) was unconstitutional, contending that claimant was denied equal protection by virtue of the law's classification of children born in and those born out of wedlock. Only the latter were required to prove both dependency on and acknowledgment by the father. On review, the court reversed the decision. The court held that the law recognized such informal relationships. Further, proof of paternity and dependency accomplished the purposes of the statutory scheme. The court held that children born out of wedlock claiming death benefits under N.Y. Work. Comp.

Accordingly, a claim filed for workers' compensation death benefits on behalf of a child born out of wedlock afer the death of his putative father, who never acknowledged claimant as his child, is reinstated; posthumous children born out of wedlock, such as claimant, are not &quot;posthumous&quot; children within the meaning of the statute and must establish their entitlement to benefits as would any child born out of wedlock. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife and cross-appellant husband both challenged a decision of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York). The decision reversed the trial court's decisions to grant the wife's motion to discontinue and refile her divorce action and allowed the husband to amend his answer provided he stipulated that the wife's rights would not be affected if she were found guilty of misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife contended that the appellate division erred in holding, as a matter of law, that the trial court could not exercise its discretion to grant her application to discontinue the action she began for divorce before the Equitable Distribution Law became effective, which provided for a more liberal distribution of property. The husband challenged the trial court's authority to condition amendment of his answer on the stipulation described above. The court modified the order of the appellate division, deleting the granting of the husband's motion to amend his answer, and, as so modified, held that a plaintiff who has commenced a matrimonial action prior to the effective date of the Equitable Distribution Law may not discontinue that action for the purpose of instituting a second action after that date in order to obtain benefits under the broader provisions relating to distribution of marital property applicable in actions commenced after the statute became effective. The wife was not entitled to receive the benefits of the Equitable Distribution Law by discontinuing her suit and refiling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the appellate division's order. The court affirmed the reversal of the order granting the wife's motion to discontinue. The court reversed the order that granted the husband's motion to amend his answer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Equitable Distribution of Marital Property</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A plaintiff who has commenced a matrimonial action prior to the effective date of the Equitable Distribution Law may not discontinue that action for the purpose of instituting a second action after that date in order to obtain benefits under the broader provisions relating to distribution of marital property applicable in actions commenced after the statute became effective (see Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 236, part B); in view of the clear intent expressed in the statute as to the applicability of its two, quite different, constituent parts, there is no room for the exercise of judicial discretion to vary what has been prescribed by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Divorce -- Equitable Distribution of Marital Property</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In an action for divorce brought by the plaintiff wife prior to the effective date of the Equitable Distribution Law (Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 236, part B), it was error to condition the grant of the defendant husband's application to amend his answer to plead counterclaims for divorce on a stipulation by him that plaintiff wife's rights would not be affected if she should be found guilty of misconduct; the plaintiff's right to alimony would be cut off if the husband established her misconduct by proof offered in support of his counterclaims for divorce based on cruel and inhuman conduct and on abandonment (see Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 236, part A) and the condition was thus imposed for the purpose of averting any prejudice to the wife.  A court is not at liberty, in granting the husband's application to interpose counterclaims for divorce in his wife's part A action, to require his consent to a variation of the substantive provisions which by legislative fiat are applicable to that action.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wife appealed the order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Second Judicial Department (New York) that affirmed a determination that the wife could not have amended her answer to add claims for equitable property distribution under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 236, part B, in the plaintiff husband's divorce action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband commenced a divorce action in April 1980. The wife filed an amended answer in October 1980 that incorporated a claim under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 236, part B., the Equitable Distribution Law, which had been enacted on July 19, 1980. The court affirmed the denial of the wife's attempt to add the claim. The court reasoned that the legislature was meticulous in its setting forth the applicability of part B, in contrast to N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 236, part A. The court observed that the legislature stated that part A, was applicable to divorce actions commenced prior to its effective date, while part B was effective as to such actions commenced after July 19, 1980. In making that determination, the court rejected the wife's claim that under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 203(c) and (e) the applicability of part B was when her claim was interposed, because the court noted that the legislature had not elected to use such language, but rather had designated commencement of the divorce action as the critical event. Further, given the intense political debate, the court did not believe that the legislature's choice of words had been inadvertent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that precluded the wife's amended answer that brought a claim for equitable property distribution because the explicit language of the Equitable Distribution Law disallowed claims under it that were part of divorce actions commenced before its enactment date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Tax Commission of New York (commission) appealed a judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the Third Judicial Department (New York), which in a proceeding pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 annulled a determination of the commission sustaining the imposition of corporate franchise tax assessments against petitioner corporation pursuant to N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 9-A.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed its New York franchise tax returns without charging itself with any portion of the &quot;accumulated&quot; income of its subsidiary, a domestic international sales corporation (DISC) that did not do business in New York. The department of taxation and finance assessed a deficiency against the corporation on that basis, finding that the corporation had failed to comply with N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 28(9). The commission sustained the assessment. The corporation argued that subjecting such income to state taxation would impose an undue burden on interstate and foreign commerce in light of the federal tax preference on such income, and on the ground that New York lacked sufficient contacts with the DISC and the income it generates to permit the imposition of the tax. The appellate court found that the imposition of a tax on &quot;accumulated&quot; DISC income by New York violated the commerce clause, but sustained the tax on &quot;deemed distributed&quot; income. The court held that the imposition of the franchise tax on the DISC income did not violate the commerce clause because the federal legislation did not preempt the field and New York had sufficient nexus to permit the imposition of the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the trial court's judgment by reinstating the determination of the commission and affirmed it as modified.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The imposition of a franchise tax by New York State on corporate income emanating from the accumulated income of a subsidiary &quot;domestic international sales corporation&quot; (DISC) (Tax Law, &sect; 208, subd 9, par [a], cl [1]), which income is not taxable to DISC shareholders under Federal law, does not violate the commerce clause, since the Federal legislation was not intended to pre-empt the field; moreover, since only that portion of the DISC income allocable to New York is subject to taxation, New York has a sufficient jurisdictional nexus to permit the imposition of such a tax on accumulated DISC income in the hands of a parent corporation that does business in New York, even where neither the DISC nor any of the parent's affiliates for which the DISC acts as export commission agent engage in business in the State or have other New York contacts.</SPAN></P>

The fact that the accumulated income of a &quot;domestic international sales corporation&quot; (DISC), taxable to DISC shareholders in New York under section 208 (subd 9, par [a], cl [1]) of the Tax Law, is subject to a tax credit under section 210 (subd 13, par [a]) of the Tax Law of a percentage of the taxpayer's accumulated DISC income allocable to New York as in-State earnings, is not inconsistent with due process mandates, since it relates to that part of the taxpayer's income that has a jurisdictional nexus with the State; furthermore, any effect the credit has on interstate commerce by providing an incentive to in-State export activity that is not available to non-New York based exporting is too indirect to run afoul of the commerce clause.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Franchise Tax on Business Corporations -- Income of &quot;DISC&quot; Subsidiary</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The imposition of a New York State franchise tax on the &quot;deemed distributed&quot; income of a &quot;domestic international sales corporation&quot; (DISC) in the hands of its New York parent corporation under subdivision 9 of section 208 of the Tax Law is not a violation of due process, even where neither the DISC nor any of the parent corporation's affiliates acting for which the DISC acts as export commission agent conducts business in New York or has other New York contacts, since, inasmuch as only that portion of the DISC income allocable to New York is subject to taxation, New York has a sufficient jurisdictional nexus to permit the imposition of such a tax; furthermore, although New York does not impose a franchise tax on a parent corporation doing business in New York for corporate income emanating from a non-DISC subsidiary, it is not irrational or a denial of equal protection clause for the State to tax the parent on the deemed distributed income of its wholly owned DISC subsidiary (Tax Law, &sect; 208, subd 8-A, par [b]), since the subsidiary would otherwise file a combined tax report with the parent and there is nothing to indicate that the tax liability of the parent corporation resulting from a combined report would be less than that imposed under the statutory scheme for the taxation of DISC income.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with 12 counts of criminal usury in the first degree under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 190.42. The first trial ended after the trial court granted defendant's motion for a mistrial. Defendant filed a proceeding to prohibit a second trial, but it was denied. Defendant pleaded guilty to criminal usury in the second degree on the condition that he could reserve the right to appeal with respect to the rulings denying his motion to suppress records and to dismiss the indictment. The court found that the assurance on which defendant's plea was predicated was ineffectual and, therefore, defendant could withdraw his guilty plea.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant's explicit reservation of the right to appeal four rulings, with the express consent of the prosecutor and the court, as part of his plea of guilty to criminal usury in the second degree under section 190.40 of the Penal Law, is ineffectual: (1) review of the ruling denying his suppression motion is statutorily preserved ( CPL 710.70, subd 2); (2) the denial of his application to dismiss the indictment on constitutional former jeopardy grounds is also appealable without regard to the guilty plea or the purported reservation; (3) his plea of guilty renders irrelevant his contention that the criminal proceedings preliminary to trial were infected with impropriety and error, and (4) he lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of section 190.42 of the Penal Law, the statute under which he was indicted, since he was not convicted thereunder.  However, defendant is permitted to withdraw his plea of guilty, and, accordingly, his conviction is vacated and the case is remitted for further proceedings on the original indictments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insureds were both injured in separate automobile accidents and claimed lost wages and received $ 800 per month from the insurers. Following a decision that under N.Y. Ins.

On appeal of the lower court's dismissal of the insureds' complaints, the court held that the decision interpreting &sect; 671 to allow for a $ 1000 recovery should have been accorded full retroactive effect. The court found that that no new principle of law had been established and the decision merely construed the language of a statute that was already in existence. The court determined that a balancing of the equities dictated that the insureds, as injured parties, not be made to bear the burden of foregoing part of the recovery to which they were statutorily entitled.

Such retroactive application of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Kurcsics</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is mandated since that case established no new principle of law, but merely construed the language of a statute that was already in existence; the purposes of the no-fault insurance legislation would be furthered by retroactive application, and, finally, a balancing of the equities dictates that the injured parties not be made to bear the burden of foregoing part of the recovery to which they were statutorily entitled.  Moreover, such retroactive application neither impairs the obligation of contracts nor effects an unconstitutional taking of property without due process. </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee appealed from an order of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), denying an application to declare unconstitutional the provisions of respondent city's charter requiring the employee to pay an amount by which a city resident personal income tax calculated on his income exceeded the amount of taxes imposed on him for the same taxable period.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the city, and as a condition of his employment he signed an agreement pursuant to the city charter wherein he promised that if he was or later became a nonresident he would pay to the city an amount by which the city resident personal income tax calculated on his income exceeded the amount of any city earnings tax and city personal income tax imposed on him for the same taxable period. The employee brought a petition seeking to declare the provision of the city charter related to the agreement unconstitutional and void as an improper tax. The city brought a motion to dismiss the petition. The trial court granted the motion, and the employee appealed. The court affirmed the order dismissing the petition, ruling that the facts of the case did not present a situation in which the city exercised its sovereign authority to impose a tax on the employee without his consent, but instead presented a situation in which the employee agreed by contract to pay a certain amount to his employer, the city. The court concluded that the mere fact that the debt incurred pursuant to the contract of employment was owed to the city did not transform it into a tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor challenged the judgment of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed the judgment denying the Commission's motion for summary judgment and granting declaratory judgment to plaintiff companies and counterclaim defendant association in a case involving the award of certain benefits to longshoremen.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four steamship companies and 26 other companies, all of which were members of the association, brought a declaratory judgment action against the Commission. They sought a declaration (1) that assessment by the Commission on the vacation and holiday benefits and guaranteed annual income (GAI) benefits was unauthorized and unconstitutional and (2) that the formula by which the Commission proposed to allocate to the respective companies a portion of the obligation for benefit payments previously made by the association's vacation, holiday, and GAI funds was arbitrary and invalid. The Commission later appealed from a judgment against it. On appeal, the issue was whether the payments made from the funds were subject to Commission assessment under the provision of a bi-State compact approved by Congress. The court reversed, finding that payments made through trust funds established pursuant to federal law covering the benefits in question were part of the gross payroll payments subject to assessment. The court also found that the trust funds making such payments were &quot;employers&quot; within the meaning of the Compact assessment provision.</SPAN></P>

The Waterfront Commission Compact provides for the payment of commission expenses, to the extent not covered by Federal grant, by an assessment upon the industry computed upon gross payroll payments at a rate not in excess of 2%, any amount over the total thus available to be financed by appropriations made by the New York and New Jersey Legislatures in proportion to the gross annual payments made to longshoremen for work in each State within the Port of New York district; payments made through trust funds established pursuant to Federal law covering vacation and holiday benefits and guaranteed annual income benefits are part of the gross payroll payments subject to assessment and the trust funds making such payments are &quot;employers&quot; within the meaning of the Compact's assessment provision, as also are direct employers of longshoremen. The assessment was enacted as a fee for the cost of administration in lieu of a license fee and not as a tonnage tax, with the purpose of imposing upon the industry the cost of eliminating unsavory and illegal employment and labor practices, and the legislative intent was to encompass in the words &quot;gross payroll payments&quot;  the labor costs of the industry however incurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department (New York), which affirmed his conviction for assault holding that admission of the preliminary hearing testimony of the witness at defendant's trial did not violate defendant's right to confrontation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of assault and sought review arguing that the court erred in reading a witness's preliminary hearing testimony into evidence at trial. Specifically, defendant argued that the People's efforts to obtain the victim's personal presence at trial did not meet the due diligence requirements pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 670.10. The court concluded that the trial and appellate court's finding, that the People exercised due diligence, was supported by the evidence, as a matter of law. Therefore, the People established the witness's unavailability. Further, the witness's testimony was reliable, and defendant's right to cross-examination at the hearing was not frustrated in any meaningful way. The court concluded that the People not only met the test of trustworthiness posed by the confrontation issue, but the prior testimony served as a basis to uphold the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed because the People exercised due diligence in attempting to secure the witness' presence at the trial and admission of her preliminary hearing testimony was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Admission of the preliminary hearing testimony of an unavailable witness, who was the victim of the assault with which defendant was charged and the sole identifying witness at defendant's trial, did not constitute an unconstitutional application of CPL 670.10 in violation of his right of confrontation (US Const, 6th Amdt; NY Const, art I, &sect; 6), where the witness, defendant's estranged &quot;common-law wife&quot;, disappeared on the eve of trial and could not be found despite diligent efforts by police to contact her or find a lead as to her whereabouts and where defendant was represented by counsel at the hearing, at which substantially the same subject matter was explored as was developed at trial, and he was furnished the opportunity to cross-examine the witness, who testified under oath, and, further, it was not error for the trial court to deny defense counsel's application to delete all of her preliminary hearing cross-examination of the witness, since this testimony was not the testimony of defendant and was no less an integral part of the testimony than that adduced on direct examination ( CPL 670.20); finally, the prior testimony so admitted required no corroboration and, under the circumstances, is legally sufficient to support defendant's conviction.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate actions against respondent city, petitioner property owners filed a motion to consolidate seven proceedings, a motion for partial summary judgment declaring N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners commenced proceedings to review the tax assessments on their properties, arguing the assessments were erroneous by reason of inequality prior to December 3, 1981, the effective date of N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 720(3). The special term found New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; 166-1.0 controlled in such proceedings, and it authorized a classified system of assessment within the city, upon which the charge of inequality must be based. Accordingly, because the special term found the state equalization rate was not admissible on the issue raised, it did not reach the question of the constitutionality of former N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 307 and 720(3). After the appellate division affirmed, the court found Admin. Code &sect; 166-1.0 authorized the property owners to present proof of inequality by showing the particular assessment was made at a higher proportionate valuation than the assessment of other real property of like character in the same ward or section, or the assessment was made at a higher proportionate valuation than the assessment of other real property on the assessment rolls of the city for the same year.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Section 166-1.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which governs the procedure for review of tax assessments in the City of New York, authorizes taxpayers who challenge the assessment of their property as unequal to present proof of inequality with respect to property of similar character in the same ward or section and/or with respect to the city-wide assessment rolls; the statute is not a legislative authorization for a classified system of assessments in the City of New York.  Furthermore, if inequality with respect to city-wide assessment rolls is asserted, the State equalization rate may not be introduced in proceedings where no evidentiary hearings were held and no interlocutory determinations were made therein prior to December 3, 1981, the effective date of subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law (L 1981, ch 1057), although the proceedings were commenced before said date, since the new statutory provision, which effectively forecloses the use of State equalization rates in inequality proceedings within the City of New York and Nassau County, applies thereto.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law (L 1981, ch 1057), which permits the use of the State equalization rate on the issue of whether an assessment is unequal, except in special assessing units with populations of one million or more, i.e., the City of New York and Nassau County, is procedural in nature and is constitutional; the provision does not deny equal protection to taxpayers within the special assessing units, since the Legislature had a rational basis in drawing the distinction,  based on the size of the population within municipal units, and in restricting the admissibility of State equalization rates in such units, and, further, the legislation does not, on its face, constitute a denial of due process to taxpayers who challenge assessments on property within New York City and Nassau County as unequal, although parcel selection and proof of actual sales, the remaining, authorized measures of proof of inequality available to them, are more cumbersome and expensive. </SPAN></P>
