</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), which sustained an assessment by appellee state tax commissioner of privilege taxes under Code, 1931, 11-13-2 and 11-13-2h. The Pennsylvania taxpayer contended that the nature of its business operations in West Virginia was such that it was not subject to any part of the tax assessed against it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer's principal office and place of business was in Pennsylvania, and it was engaged in the business of furnishing managerial services and advice to coal mining companies. Its meager business in West Virginia was limited to providing services and advice to one West Virginia corporation. No deduction was made from the West Virginia corporation's state taxes on its gross receipts for the amount paid to the taxpayer under the managerial contract, and the taxpayer paid a Pennsylvania corporate income tax on its earnings under the managerial contract. The taxpayer maintained no office and owned no property in West Virginia. A relatively small portion of the West Virginia managerial services resulted from the physical presence of the taxpayer's representatives in West Virginia. Tax statutes were construed strictly against the taxing power and liberally in favor of the taxpayer. The court concluded that the taxpayer was not subject to the privilege tax on its meager business in West Virginia that was incidental to its Pennsylvania business and that the taxpayer was not engaged in a service business or calling &quot;within this State&quot; under Code, 1931, 11-13-2 and 11-13-2h.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the circuit court's judgment and remanded to the circuit court with directions to dismiss the proceeding pending therein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The accused was charged with killing a woman on whom he performed an unlawful abortion in violation of Code, 1931, 61-2-8. He filed a plea in abatement alleging that a trial on his indictment in the county of the forum court would have constituted a violation of Article III, &sect; 14 of the Constitution of West Virginia, which assured a defendant the right to be tried in the county where the offense was committed. The circuit court overruled the accused's plea and set the case for trial. The accused filed a petition for a writ of prohibition to restrain the judge from proceeding with a trial on the indictment. The petition was dismissed. The court affirmed, holding that the accused was not charged with unlawful abortion; rather, he was charged with murder. Even he was not physically present in the county where the court was located when the victim's death occurred, the accused, by performing the abortion, set in force an agency which resulted in the crime of murder. Thus, he accompanied the agency to the county of the forum court, the point where the crime of murder became effectual. Thus, the offense charged in the indictment was committed in the county of the forum court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An opinion was issued that applied to two companion proceedings for the purpose of stating the reasons that caused the court to deny the relief sought in a mandamus proceeding and to dismiss that proceeding, and to reverse the judgments in a civil action and to remand that action to the Circuit Court of Greenbrier County, West Virginia, with the specified directions in connection with the creation of an airport authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The controlling question in the two companion cases related to the constitutionality of a statute that authorized the creation by the County Court of Greenbrier County of an airport authority and empowered the authority to construct, maintain, and operate an airport in that county. The statute in question was Chapter 62, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1966, known as Senate Bill No. 66, West Virginia, and the proceedings in which its constitutional validity or invalidity had to be determined were an original proceeding in mandamus, and a civil action, instituted in the circuit court. Section 14 of the Act had previously been found to be unconstitutional. Petitioner in the mandamus proceeding and defendants in the civil action asserted that the Act was valid and constitutional. The court found that a special act authorizing the county court to create an airport authority was unconstitutional and void in its entirety as violative of the provision of Article VI, &sect; 39, of the Constitution of West Virginia that in no case should a special act be passed, where a general law would be proper, and could be made applicable to the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The writ of mandamus was denied and the proceeding in mandamus was dismissed. Plaintiff in the civil action was entitled to the relief for which he prayed, and the judgments of the Circuit Court of Greenbrier County, which denied him the relief were reversed. The civil action was also remanded with directions to grant to plaintiff the relief prayed for, including the injunctive relief that he sought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner accused applied for a writ of prohibition to restrain respondents, a county judge and a city prosecutor, from proceeding further against him upon two separate warrants that charged him with the offenses of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One of the warrants upon which the accused had been arrested had been issued by the city's lieutenant of police pursuant to article 7, &sect; 7.6 of the Charter of the City of South Charleston. In his application for the writ, the accused claimed that the charter section constituted an unconstitutional delegation of judicial authority and was otherwise in conflict with the statutory scheme contained in Chapter 62, Article 1, &sect;&sect; 1, 3, and 10 of the West Virginia Code, which set forth those that could issue warrants. The court denied the accused's application for the writ, holding there was nothing in Chapter 62, Article 1 of the Code that prevented a city from specifying who might issue warrants and that in absence of any statutory proscription, Article 7, &sect; 7.6 of the city charter was not in contravention of the separation of powers clause contained in Article V, &sect; 1 of the West Virginia Constitution. The court also ruled that the phrase &quot;in the absence of the chief of police,&quot; as used in the charter, did not require such absence to be beyond all possibility of communication but that it was sufficient if the chief was away from his primary place of duty during normal off-duty hours.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant brought a writ of error from a summary conviction by the Circuit Court of Wetzel County (West Virginia) of contempt. Defendant was a reporter, and the trial court held him in contempt because of a story he wrote about a civil proceeding pending in the trial court. The State moved to dismiss and claimed that defendant did not comply with Code, 1931, 58-5-4, which applied to criminal cases and stated technical requirements for an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's story stated that a city admitted liability in a civil action and that it had insurance. Defendant argued that it was improper to proceed against him summarily and that his actions did not constitute contempt. On appeal, the court held that (1) the proceeding was not subject to the requirements of 58-5-4 because, although contempt proceedings were in the nature of a criminal trial, precedent provided that they were not, strictly, criminal cases; (2) Code, 1931, 61-5-26, allowed summary punishment for contempt for misbehavior in the presence of the presiding court, or so near thereto as to obstruct or interrupt the administration of justice; and (3) the language of 61-5-26 was clear and unambiguous, it referred to conduct in the presiding court's presence or in close physical proximity, and it did not encompass misconduct, however distant from the presiding court, that merely resulted in or caused an obstruction or interruption of the administration of justice. The court declined to find whether defendant was insulated from the contempt charge by the freedom of the press provisions in the First Amendment and in Article III, &sect; 7, of the Constitution of West Virginia.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient was injured in a car accident and was treated at a veteran's hospital.

The trial court permitted the government to intervene as a party. The government's claim was dismissed with prejudice. Upon a stipulation that the patient and individuals had settled all claims between them without any admission of liability, the trial court dismissed the patient's action with prejudice. On review, the court found that the government had an independent statutory right under &sect; 2651, distinguished from its right to any subrogation, to prosecute and establish its claim against defendants for the patient's medical treatment. It reversed the dismissal of the government's claim. The court observed that the government was not entitled to judgment in its favor in its appeal as the record did not contain adequate proof against the individuals.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An original proceeding in mandamus was instituted by petitioners, the State Building Commission of West Virginia and the Governor, in which they sought a writ to require defendant Secretary of State to affix his signature and the State Seal to a certain temporary bond certificate in the amount of $ 250,000.00, prepared and issued by the Governor pursuant to an order of the commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant refused to perform the acts for the reason that the statute authorizing such certificate, Senate Bill No. 42, enacted by the Legislature at its regular session, 1966, was unconstitutional as violative of Article V of the Constitution of West Virginia. Defendant attacked the statute on the specific ground that the Commission was composed of members of the executive and the legislative departments of the government in violation of the Constitution. Petitioners asserted the constitutionality of the statute but insisted that if the provision that related to the membership of the Commission was unconstitutional the remaining portions of the act, being separable, constituted a valid and constitutional statute. The court found that notwithstanding the invalidity of the provision of &sect; 1, Article 6, Chapter 5, Code, 1931 (West Virginia), as amended, being &sect; 1, Chapter 8, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1966, concerning the members, and notwithstanding the rejection of that provision because violative of Article V of the Constitution, the remaining portion was constitutional and its validity was upheld inasmuch as that portion of the statute was distinct and separable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original mandamus proceeding, petitioners, the members of a Democratic committee and its chairman, sought a writ to compel defendants, a county court and its commissioners, to act in a dispute regarding election officers. The court sustained the demurrer of petitioners to the answer of defendants, because it was insufficient, and awarded a writ of mandamus.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners sought a writ to compel defendants to reconvene in a special meeting and set aside an order to the extent that it appointed a list of Democratic election officers to serve in the place and stead of the Democratic election officers for which appointment was requested by the committee, and to enter an order appointing as Democratic election officers to serve in the Primary Election of May 10, 1966, the persons named and designated as precinct election officers in the list submitted to the county court by the committee. The court found that petitioners had fully complied with the requirements of the applicable statute, &sect; 28, Article 1, Chapter 3, Code, 1931 (West Virginia), as amended, and consequently were entitled to the writ of mandamus. The court rejected defendants' argument that an executive committee of a political party was vested with sovereign power and its members were public officers. Officers of a political party, although provided for by statutory law, could not be regarded as public or governmental officers. In the absence of statute, committees of any political party, in acting for the party's interests, were not acting as officers of the state.</SPAN></P>

The workmen's compensation commissioner held that plaintiff's claim was compensable. The court found that the award of workmen's compensation benefits to plaintiff necessarily embraced a determination that his injuries were sustained during the course of and as a result of his employment. Had defendant been injured at the same time and place, the same principles would have been applicable in determining the compensability of a claim by him for workmen's compensation benefits. Plaintiff insisted, nevertheless, that defendant, at the time and place plaintiff sustained his injuries, was not acting in furtherance of the employer's business within the meaning of &sect; 6a. The court held that it was obvious that the purpose of the legislature was to extend the same immunity and to accord an immunity identical with that of the employer to additional persons, including fellow employees. It was clear that the employer and thus a fellow employee would be immune under &sect; 6 from liability in damages for the injuries sustained by plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county court had adopted an order pursuant to Code, 1931, 7-2-2 (W. Va.), which redistricted the county so that it would be composed of four instead of three magisterial districts. The order conformed the county's districts to the constitutional provision that contemplated equality of population among the county's magisterial districts. After the order was adopted, the county clerk's office arranged to procure voting machine ballot labels for a scheduled primary election that reflected the existence of the four new districts. The court rejected the ballot commissioners' request for a writ of mandamus to compel the county court and clerk to void the redistricting order and to use ballot labels reflecting the three old districts. The Code gave county courts power to increase the number and change the boundary lines of magisterial districts, and did not limit exercise of that power to nonelection years or to a certain time prior to a primary election. The board of ballot commissioners had no authority to override the redistricting action or to formulate a ballot on the basis of three magisterial districts for a primary election to be held in a county having four such districts.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained respondents' objections to the landowner's action and certified a question to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondents objected to the landowners' petition for a writ of certiorari on the grounds that decisions of the city board of directors were legislative in nature and not subject to review by certiorari. The trial court sustained respondents' objections and certified a question to the court. Specifically, the trial court asked whether the landowners sufficiently alleged a cause of action that could be reviewed by the trial court in certiorari. The court affirmed the trial court's decision to sustain respondents' objections and answered the certified question in the negative. The court found that writ of certiorari was only available to review judicial or quasi-judicial actions of an inferior board or tribunal. The city board of directors' decision to amend the ordinance was a purely legislative act. The fact that the planning commission held a public hearing on the amendment before recommending it did not change the nature of the city board of directors' act. Furthermore, although some final decisions of the planning commission were reviewable by a writ of certiorari, it did not follow that recommendations by the planning commission were also reviewable.</SPAN></P>

The corporation contended that its business in that respect was an instrumentality of interstate commerce and that the tax in question constituted an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. On the other hand, the Commissioner contended that the corporation's business activity upon which the taxes in question were levied was performed wholly within the state and that, therefore, it was not an activity in interstate commerce. The Commissioner asserted that, even if the business activity of the corporation was one in interstate commerce, the tax imposed was not precluded or rendered unlawful by the Commerce Clause.

In 1965, the inmate applied for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the sentence of life imprisonment was unconstitutional and void for the reason that he had been denied the assistance of counsel on the charge that occurred in 1937. Because the record was silent as to whether the inmate had received assistance of counsel in the 1937, the court concluded that he had not and declared that the life sentence under the habitual offender statute was void. The court remanded the inmate to custody of the warden for service of the remaining portion of his valid sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted relief to the inmate to the extent of voiding his life sentence and remanded him to the custody of the warden until he had served the valid sentence to which he was subject as provided by law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue was whether the widow was entitled to benefits at the rate of $ 75 a month under a statute that was in effect when her husband died as a result of third stage silicosis or whether she was entitled to benefits at the rate of $ 65 a month under a statute in effect when her husband terminated his employment with the employer because of ill health. At the time the husband ceased work, Code, 1931, 23-4-10 (West Virginia), as amended in 1957, provided for benefits to a dependent widow at the rate of $ 65 a month. At the time of the husband's death, Code, 1931, 23-4-10 (West Virginia), as a consequence of a 1961 amendment, provided for benefits to a dependent widow at the rate of $ 75 a month. The court reversed. The rights and obligations of the employer and the husband under the workmen's compensation statutes became fixed and determined when the husband terminated his employment. The date of termination was the equivalent of the date of the workman's &quot;injury.&quot; The Director and the Board made an unwarranted retroactive application of the statutory amendment that increased dependent widow benefits from $ 65 to $ 75.

Afterward, the State filed an information charging that the inmate had been convicted of three previous offenses punishable by confinement in a penitentiary. The jury found that the inmate was the same person as previously convicted, and the court sentenced the inmate to life imprisonment. The inmate contended that two of his prior convictions could not be used to enhance his sentence because they were obtained when he had no assistance of counsel and had not waived that right. The court noted that convictions obtained in violation of an inmate's right to assistance of counsel could not be used to justify a sentence under the recidivist statute of West Virginia. Because the inmate was denied the assistance of counsel in the two prior convictions, the court concluded that enforcement of the life sentence could be prevented by this habeas corpus proceedings. Considering that the inmate had served the maximum period of sentence allowed by law for his grand larceny conviction, the court held that he was entitled to release from confinement.</SPAN></P>

The corporations brought petitions for writs of prohibition seeking to prevent the justices from prosecuting them, arguing that the Sunday Closing Law was unconstitutional. The court ruled that the freedom to act was not totally free from legislative restrictions. Further, the court held that legislative power over mere opinion was forbidden but it could reach people's actions when they were found to be in violation of important social duties or subversive of good order. The court denied the petitions for writs of prohibition, concluding that the Sunday Closing Law affected all persons similarly situated or engaged in the same business throughout the state, and that it did not show on its face that the classifications unreasonably or arbitrarily separated persons, places, or things in violation of the constitutional prohibition against special legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested on several warrants charging him with selling cigarettes at retail for a price below the minimum established by Regulation CSA-2 promulgated by the Tax Commissioner of the State of West Virginia. Defendant argued that the Cigarette Sales Act, Code, 47-13-13, on which the charges were based, was unconstitutional. The circuit court sustained defendant's demurrer to the charges, and the court affirmed. Under the Act, a retailer or wholesaler could not sell cigarettes at less than cost to such a retailer or wholesaler with intent to injure competitors or destroy or substantially lessen competition. The court found that the proviso in Code, 47-13-11 (a), which defined the cost to a retailer, was incomprehensible. The court held that the provisions were so vague and uncertain as to prevent any ordinary retailer from determining the price at which he might legally sell cigarettes without contravening the provisions of the statute. A retailer was thus forced to rely upon the prices fixed, arbitrarily or otherwise, by Regulation CSA-2, the basis for which was not shown by the record.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was a foreign corporation that was engaged in construction work within the state for a limited period. It was assessed on December 31, 1960, for 1961 taxes on its personal property within the state and paid those taxes. Code 11-3-1 was amended to require the assessor to assess for 1962 taxes on personal property located in the state on July 1, 1961. The taxpayer removed all of its property from the state by December 31, 1961, and thus argued that it was not liable to the state for taxes for the year 1962. The circuit court found for the taxpayer in its action to recover the taxes paid for 1962, but the court reversed. The court found that Code, 11A-1-2, as amended in 1961, provided that a lien attached on the assessment date, July 1, 1961, for the taxes for the ensuing fiscal year. The legislature had the power to fix the time at which property within its jurisdiction was assessed. The court held that personal property that was located within the state for a period of time acquired a tax situs and could be assessed on any day fixed by the legislature, even though the property was removed from the state before the tax was due.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a statute was enacted legally if there was substantial compliance with constitutional requirements of publication, like or similar to the constitutional requirement, in submitting a proposed amendment to a vote of the people. In addition, every reasonable presumption should have been given to the adoption of the amendment. Pursuant to the constitutional provision, a proposed amendment was to be published in a newspaper at least three months before the general election. The court found that there was substantial compliance with such provision relating to publication of the amendment. In addition, the court determined that the Amendment had been adopted legally.

The trial court had no authority to impose a one to ten year sentence upon the inmate, that being the statutory penalty for the principal crime of which he had been convicted and not yet sentenced, inasmuch as under the provisions of Code, 61-11-18, as amended, it became the mandatory duty of the trial court to impose a life sentence in the penitentiary upon the inmate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner, who had been sentenced after he was convicted of grand larceny, contended that the sentence of life imprisonment was unconstitutional because he had been denied the assistance of counsel in two former criminal proceedings. The court granted the writ. The court observed that a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States holding that the denial of the assistance of counsel in a criminal proceeding violated the Sixth Amendment applied to and invalidated any prior conviction of an offense within the meaning of a recidivist statute. The court stated that the sentence of life imprisonment imposed upon the prisoner under &sect;&sect; 18, 19, Article 11, Chapter 61, Code, 1931 was null and void and its enforcement would be prevented in the prisoner's habeas corpus proceeding. The court noted that while the grand larceny conviction was regular and valid and if the sentence to which the prisoner was subject for conviction of that offense had been imposed instead of the invalid sentence of life imprisonment, it would have required his confinement in the penitentiary for the term provided, it clearly appeared that the maximum period of such confinement had terminated.</SPAN></P>

In West Virginia, she was taxed on the full purchase price pursuant to &sect; 17A-3-4. She wrote a letter to the commissioner demanding a refund of the full tax amount she paid or in the alternative for a refund of the sum representing the amount of tax computed on the value of the used car she traded in. The commissioner declined to make a refund and filed a declaratory judgment action to determine the constitutionality of &sect; 17A-3-4. The trial court granted the taxpayer's summary judgment motion, and the commissioner appealed. The court affirmed. The test of the validity of a state taxing law was whether it could, in its practical operation, be made an instrument for impeding or destroying interstate commerce. A state could not impose any tax which discriminated against, impeded or had the effect of regulating interstate commerce. The amendment to &sect; 17A-3-4, which permitted a deduction for vehicles purchased in West Virginia, was unconstitutional because it created an unwarranted discrimination against interstate commerce. It was permissible to declare just this part of the statute void without voiding the entire statute.</SPAN></P>

Respondent argued that the Act was unconstitutional under &sect;&sect; 8, 6, and 1 of Art. 10 of the Constitution of West Virginia. The court noted that &sect; 8 granted authority to relator to have superintendent over the fiscal affairs of the county. The Act did not violate &sect; 1 in providing that the building was tax exempt as long as it was owned by the municipality. The factual findings of the legislature in the Act were legislative, not juridical findings; the court was bound thereby. The Act did not violate &sect; 6 because the bonds were payable out of the revenue from the industrial plant and did not constitute an indebtedness of the county.</SPAN></P>

Prohibition was a proper proceeding for a determination of whether a trial court was undertaking to proceed to try the corporations under a void statute. The court held that Chapter 37, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1963 was void. The amended Sunday law did not operate to repeal the prior statute. The Legislature passed the amended Sunday law after the expiration of its regular session, as described in Article VI, &sect; 22 of the Constitution, despite of the use of the tactic of stopping the clock. The House journal was ambiguous regarding the time of the adjournment of the legislative session. The House journal provided evidence that the session was extended past midnight on the last day of the session, in violation of &sect; 22, as it contained the objections of several delegates that the vote on the Sunday law occurred after midnight.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that although the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954, which was mentioned in the bill, was never read in the West Virginia House of Delegates, it was not required. The court considered W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 29, and found that &sect; 29 did not expressly require that an &quot;urgency&quot; be stated in the journal, or that it be specifically defined, or stated to exist. The court reasoned that &sect; 29 did not provide the form, or set limitations to the manner in which the dispensing power shall be exercised. The court also found that the Legislature had the power and the policy of determining whether &quot;incomes&quot; to be taxed should be something different than the total or gross income, which included the power to determine what credits or deductions, were reasonable and necessary to equally and uniformly adjust the tax burden of the respective taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court, although expressing some doubt as to the validity of defendant's sentence, refused a writ of error, and defendant appealed. The court held that because the Commission was not constitutionally created, and had no legal existence, defendant did not falsely swear. The court found that the parties stipulated that the vote of each house of the West Virginia Legislature on the resolution alleged to have created the Commission, that being House Concurrent Resolution No. 27, was, in the House of Delegates, 72 in favor of its adoption, and 26 against its adoption, and in the Senate, 17 for its adoption, and 13 against its adoption, and thus, the Resolution was not adopted by the two-thirds vote of the members elected to each house required by W.Va.

Later petitioner was indicted for conspiracy for the same murder and a verdict of not guilty was entered. A date was then set for a second trial of petitioner upon the original indictment for murder. Petitioner argued that the trial for conspiracy barred the trial under the first indictment under the double jeopardy principles in Article III, &sect; 5, of the Constitution of West Virginia and United States Constitution, Amendment V. The court found that the offense of which petitioner was acquitted was the same offense with which he was charged in the indictment for murder. The circuit court in directing that he be again tried would have caused him to be tried a second time for the same offense of which he had been acquitted. The court ruled that to permit the circuit court to try petitioner on the pending indictment for murder would have enabled that court to exercise jurisdiction it did not possess and to exceed its legitimate powers. Under &sect; 1, Article 1, Chapter 53, Code, 1931 (West Virginia), the writ of prohibition was available to prevent such action.</SPAN></P>

The board filed a complaint against him for practicing dentistry without a license in violation of W. Va.

Thereafter, the legislature amended &sect; 30-4-2 to include the repair of false teeth within the definition of the practice of dentistry. The board appealed the trial court's judgment, and the court affirmed. The dental technician had moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground of mootness. Though the statute was amended, the justiciability of the cause is determined by what the law stated at the time the complaint was filed. There was a real controversy at the time the complaint was filed; therefore, the issue was not rendered moot by the amendment. Further, the amendment did not have retrospective operation. As the law was written at the time suit was filed, the dental technician's activities did not constitute the practice of dentistry; therefore, the trial court correctly dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>

If insufficient funds were received, there was no provision for the payment of salaries. Money remaining in the county justices' account at the end of the fiscal year became a part of the regular county general fund under &sect; 7, Article 19, Chapter 71, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1961. The statutes could create a tendency for the justices to find an accused guilty in order to obtain funds or to assess higher fines in order to have sufficient funds to pay the full salaries of all justices of the peace in the county. The court concluded that the justice of the peace was disqualified to try the case because he had a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case. Due process required that his compensation not depend upon a fund created by his own convictions, and prohibition was the proper procedure to restrain him from trying a case in which he was disqualified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At a general election for the office of county commissioner, the Republican nominee received the higher number of votes. However, he died before he qualified for the office, and the Democratic nominee assumed office. The court determined that a vacancy existed in the office for the purpose of appointment nothwithstanding the occupancy by the Democratic nominee. Pursuant to W. Va. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 30, vacancies in the office of county commissioner were to be filled by the county court until the next general election. Although Code, 3-10-8 (West Virginia) empowered the governor to fill any vacancy that deprived the county court of a quorum, the statute could only apply where there was a vacancy of two or more members of the county court. Any attempt by the legislature to prescribe a method to fill a vacancy in a case provided for in the constitution was invalid. Therefore, under the clear and unambiguous language of the constitution, the governor had no authority to appoint anyone to fill the alleged vacancy on the county court because W. Va. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 30 prescribed the mode for filling the single alleged vacancy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bonds were executed under Chapter 133, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1959, (West Virginia Code, 13-1-35). In addition to the airport bonds, the taxpayers also were assessed levies to pay interest on a sinking fund. The taxpayers claimed that the levies were in excess of the maximum statutory amounts and further contended that the statute was unconstitutional and that the bonds executed pursuant to the statute were invalid. The court found that under Article X, &sect; 1 of the West Virginia Constitution, the aggregate of taxes assessed in any one year was not to exceed the amounts specified in the constitutional provision. However, the court determined that the constitutional provision only related to levies for the support of public schools. Therefore, the court found that respondents were not permitted to assess additional levies for airport bonds upon the taxpayers that exceeded the maximum amounts. The court held that when a legislative enactment was unconstitutional clearly, it had the plain duty to declare it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner alleged insufficiency of the indictment under which he was charged under Code, 62-9-6, as amended. The warden demurred to the petition, and the case was submitted for decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner alleged that his imprisonment, detention, and confinement in a state penitentiary was illegal, unreasonable, unconstitutional, and void because the indictment upon which he was convicted for armed robbery and sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years did not charge him with the commission of a felony. The court granted the writ of habeas corpus and ordered the prisoner discharged. The indictment was insufficient because of the omission of the word &quot;feloniously&quot; to describe the acts alleged to have been done by the prisoner in violation of Code, 61-2-12, as amended. The statutory form for an indictment for the offense, found at Code, 62-9-6, as amended, included the word &quot;feloniously&quot; three times. Code, 62-2-11, the criminal statute of jeofails, could not be used to cure such an omission. Under Code, 61-1-11, as amended, all offenses that were not felonies were misdemeanors, and the prisoner's sentence exceeded the term of imprisonment allowed for a misdemeanor, which was one year. The prisoner's conviction, sentence, and commitment to the penitentiary were illegal, and he was entitled to release.</SPAN></P>

It noted that the criminal court's order was not final, nor was the order of the circuit court reversing the criminal court's holding and certifying the questions. The court opined that the part of the statute relative to tending to corrupt the morals of youth should be held unconstitutional, because it did not provide a proper standard to determine guilt and was, therefore, in violation of due process. However, the second count in the indictment was an offense indictable at common law. The court determined that it was a question for the jury, after viewing the pictures in question, to ascertain whether they were obscene. The standard to be used by the jury was whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards to the pictures in question, taken as a whole, felt that they appealed to prurient interest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The West Virginia State Bar Association filed a complaint against a layman who allegedly engaged in the practice of law for several years. The Bar sought to enjoin him from doing so and introduced evidence that he had been representing clients in front of the State Compensation Commissioner or his duly appointed trial examiners and in behalf of two such claimants prepared notices of appeal to the Appeal Board from awards and rulings of the commissioner involving issues of fact and questions of law. The layman responded, admitting that he had made certain appearances but denied that he advised or otherwise represented himself as being qualified to practice law. he claimed that he was permitted to represent claimants in such proceedings because he received no compensation and he was otherwise authorized as a union representative. The lower court found against the layman and issued the injunction but the layman appealed.

The husband petitioned for modification of the decree, seeking, among other things, an injunction to stop the wife, a Jehovah's witness, from hosting religious meetings in her home. The court reversed the decision of the domestic relations court, affirmed by the circuit court, that had allowed the injunction. The court held that the injunction violated W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 15 by imposing a restriction on the wife's practice of her religious faith in her own home. The court held that there was no evidence that the children were neglected, abused, mistreated, or subjected to immoral influence, and restrictions to the wife's custody were not appropriate. The court held that the domestic relations court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the wife's claim for additional support.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county tax assessor assessed the bank's capital stock shares at $ 7,700,000. The bank sought review in the county court urging that the tax was excessive, in part, because it had been assessed at 100 percent of its actual value whereas other property within the county had been assessed at a lower rate. The county court found the tax to be correct. The trial court reduced the value of the shares to $ 6,000,000, but refused to lower the percentage of the true and actual value. The bank appealed this decision, arguing that the county assessor had arbitrarily assessed other species of property within the county at a lesser percentage than its true and actual value and this violated the bank's constitutional rights. W. V. Const. art X, &sect; 1. The court reversed, holding that W. V. Const. art X., &sect; 1 was an amendment which limited the ability to tax the bank's capital stock shares because. The constitutional provision encompassed a scheme in which all property of a certain species was assessed at a percent substantially less than their actual value. Stock shares were among such property, and therefore, assessing ad valorem tax based on 100 percent of their value was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 13(a) authorizing the state auditor to promulgate rules regarding the processing of payroll was not inconsistent with W. Va. Code &sect; 6-7-1, which required that state officers be paid in equal monthly installments at the end of each month, reasoning that because the statutes were in pari materia, they should have been read and construed together. The court noted that W. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 12-3-13(a) required that all state employees be paid at least once every 31 days. The court concluded that the state auditor had direct authority to promulgate his rule under &sect; 13(a), and that therefore, although the legislature could not have intended to permit the state auditor to delay payment of salaries into a subsequent month, that issue had to be resolved by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners filed a declaratory judgment proceeding with respect to a city ordinance. The abutters filed a motion to dismiss. The trial court entered a decree that the ordinance was null and void and overruled the abutters' motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court reversed the decree. The city's council was vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to vacate the portion of the subject street under 1933 W. Va. Acts ch. 126, art. 2, &sect; 8(a). The findings at the proceeding at which the ordinance was adopted could not be questioned in the collateral attack upon the validity of the ordinance under 1941 W. Va. Acts ch. 26, &sect; 2 because the action of the city's council was not being attacked on the basis of fraud, collusion, wrong doing, or the lack of jurisdiction. Therefore, it was erroneous for the trial court to admit evidence controverting the council's findings. It was also erroneous to allow the property owners to introduce evidence on damages because such coercive relief was not obtainable in a declaratory judgment petition. The property owners were not entitled to relief because, unlike the abutters' land, their land did not actually abut the vacated portion of the street.</SPAN></P>

The telephone company alleged that the ordinance constituted part of a plan to coerce it to accept a franchise that was unacceptable to it. The circuit court enjoined the enforcement of the entire ordinance against the telephone company. The court reversed the circuit court's order that enjoined the enforcement of the ordinance, with the exception of the provision that required payment of the annual license fee.

</DIV>

The Clerk demanded an additional fee pursuant to an ordinance the county board of education adopted under an act of the legislature. The grantees sought a writ of mandamus requiring the Clerk to admit the deed. The court granted the writ. It held that the ordinance, which purported to impose a tax upon the privilege of recording certain legal instruments was void. The Chapter 67, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1957, purporting to delegate to the board the power to impose by ordinance such a tax was in clear contravention of Article V, &sect; 1 and Article XII, &sect; 5 of the Constitution of West Virginia. The act attempted to delegate to the board the power to impose a tax. Such delegation of power was not contingent upon the authority of the people of that county as required by Article XII, &sect; 5 of the Constitution. The tax was not a property tax but a privilege tax. It was not possible that the people of the county could have approved the imposition of the tax at any election at which they approved the general school levy or any increased levy under Article X of the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff manufacturer appealed a decision from the Circuit Court, Kanawha County (West Virginia), which held that the Fair Trade Act, 1937 W. Va. Acts 123, violated W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 30. The Act required anyone who advertised, offered, or sold a trademarked item to apply a minimum price to it. Defendant retailer had not complied, and the manufacturer filed for an injunction. The circuit court certified other questions for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A provision of the Fair Trade Act, 1937 W. Va. Acts ch. 123, &sect; 6, created a cause of action for trademark owners and others when anyone advertised, offered, or sold their trademarked items at a price lower than that set by the trademark owners and dealers. The action was available whether or not the advertisers, offerors, or sellers were parties to the price-fixing contract. The manufacturer filed an action against the retailer to enjoin it from selling the manufacturer's trademarked items at a lower price. The circuit court held that the Act violated the title clause of the state constitution, W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 30, and refused to issue the injunction. On appeal, the court explained that the &quot;so-called Fair Trade Act&quot; was merely a ruse to permit price-fixing, depriving sellers of their property rights without due process of law in violation of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. This was an improper exercise of the state's police power. Because the Act was void, its relation to federal antitrust laws was moot. Finally, the Act's title did not reflect its contents because it did not warn those who did not sign the price-fixing contracts that they could be liable for violating them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that part of the circuit court's decision holding that the Fair Trade Act violated the title clause of the state constitution. The court reversed that part of the circuit court's decision holding that the Act did not violate the due process clause of the state constitution and exceed the state's police powers. The court held that questions regarding the Act's validity in light of federal antitrust legislation were moot.</SPAN></P>

VI, &sect; 39 even though it was a special law passed solely for the benefit of the county library. The court found that the Act was not clearly unconstitutional, and the power granted to the court to levy and pay money to the library was delegated to the county court by the State and supervised by the legislature. The court recognized the general prohibition against special and local laws in enumerated areas but held that it was not practicable that all legislation be by general laws in order for local self-government to be effectuated. The court rejected the county court's claim that the library was not a function of government and that the legislature had no authority to expend funds for its maintenance.</SPAN></P>

The Commission awarded the company a construction permit that was unlimited as to the type of racing that would conducted on the company's track. The construction of the racetrack was approved by voters, and the company took steps to construct the racetrack. Meanwhile, ch. 95 was enacted by the West Virginia Legislature. Once a permit was issued for a racetrack construction of a certain type, the legislation prohibited a change of the type of horse racing within one year from the date of the construction of the track. The prohibition was retroactive. The company sought an order from the Commission stating that ch. 95 was an unconstitutional retroactive limit on a previously granted vested right. The Commission refused to so find, and the company sought a writ of mandamus. The court determined that the company effectively amended its written application at the hearing, and as such, the Commission had a ministerial duty to issue a construction permit for both types of racing.</SPAN></P>

They filed a return showing what they deemed to be the properties' true value. The county assessor reassessed the properties, and the taxpayers appealed. The county court reduced some valuations. On further appeal, the circuit court affirmed the valuations. The taxpayers appealed; defendant in error challenged the court's jurisdiction to review the valuations. The court held it had jurisdiction to review questions involving the tax valuation of property. However, such review was limited to cases involving the constitutionality of a statute, or cases requiring a determination whether the valuation was supported by substantial evidence or whether the valuation was palpably wrong so as to violate the uniformity requirement of W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The assessments in dispute were not made in violation of a statute, nor did they contravene any constitutional provision. The court found substantial evidence to support the assessments based on the testimony of the assessor, the deputy assessor, and a mining engineer. The testimony of the taxpayers' witnesses, at most, created a mere conflict in the evidence.</SPAN></P>

He sought to apply for a writ of error but could not afford to pay for the transcript.

In granting the writ, the court held that though a criminal defendant was not entitled to a writ of error as a matter of right, a defendant had the right to apply for a writ of error under W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 10, 17, and the Fourteenth Amendment. Implied in the defendant's right to apply for a writ of error was the right to an effective application and without a transcript of the proceedings, such right was withheld. Although under &sect; 7, Article 7, Chapter 52, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1947 (West Virginia), indigent persons who have appointed counsel were entitled to be furnished a transcript without charge, &sect; 7 was unconstitutional in violation of equal protection because it afforded transcripts without charge only to persons with appointed counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was nothing in the record to indicate an administrative interpretation of &sect; 4 by the secretary by issuing charters to incorporated companies which authorized the denial of voting rights to any person who owned stock therein until 31 years after the section was adopted. The court determined that &sect; 4 was clear and unambiguous, and there was no occasion to resort to the rules of construction in ascertaining its meaning. The court found that, because the language of &sect; 4 was clear and free from ambiguity, no official of the executive branch of the government, or legislative body, or the court had the power to change its provisions. The court concluded, therefore, that the provisions contained in W. Va. Code &sect; 31-1-22 and &sect; 31-1-66 were invalid.</SPAN></P>

The maintenance of the bridge was a governmental function because it was necessary for travel by the public to and from the City so the City was not immune from liability. However, the violation of the restrictive covenants did not constitute a taking because the landowners entered into the covenants with the knowledge that the government had the absolute right to acquire lands for governmental purposes. That right could not be disposed of by private contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff railroad company appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court, Kanawha County (West Virginia), which upheld the validity of street paving assessments by defendant city against the railroad company's land that abutted improved streets. The contractor who was awarded the paving contract was also named as a defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The railroad company was a foreign corporation that owned land within the corporate limits of the city. There were railroad tracks on the land, which pre-dated the incorporation of the city. The city adopted a resolution providing for the assessment of land abutting two streets for the purpose of paving those streets. The railroad company protested the assessment, arguing that the improvement would not increase the value of its land. The city passed the ordinance levying the paving assessment. The contractor was the low bidder. The railroad company brought suit challenging the assessment, but the circuit court upheld the assessment. In reversing, the court held that the necessity or advisability of street improvements was strictly within the province of the city. However, the existence or non-existence of special benefits accruing to land subject to special assessment was not binding and was subject to judicial review. The assessment could not be enforced because the railroad company's land did not accrue any special benefit from the assessment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the circuit court's judgment, reinstated the railroad company's bill of complaint, and remanded the cause with directions to make a decree declaring the certificates of assessment issued by the city against the railroad company's land void. The city was perpetually enjoined from collecting the assessment from the railroad company.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court overruled the guest's demurrer that the compensation statutes did not apply to him because he was not an employee. The court found that the facts alleged in the driver's plea were sufficient, if proved, to establish that the guest was not a manager who was exempt from the compensation statutes. Even though the plea described the guest's position as branch manager, the allegations of the plea as to the nature of his status, his duties, and his responsibilities were sufficient to show that he was merely a branch manager in name. The court reversed the order sustaining the demurrer that contended that a section of the compensation statute was unconstitutional for the reason that its object was not embraced in the title because the title of the first act sufficiently embraced the matters contained in the amendatory act.</SPAN></P>

The dependent widow filed a claim for death benefits, which the Commissioner denied on the ground that the employee did not die from silicosis in its third stage accompanied by tuberculosis. The appeal board affirmed the Commissioner's order, and the dependent widow sought review. The court determined that the burns from the fire did not break the causal connection between the industrial injury and the employee's death. There was ample support in the record for a finding that the death of the employee resulted from silicosis in the third stage. The court concluded that, although the date of the last exposure of the employee exposure to silicon dioxide dust in harmful quantities was prior to the effective date of Chapter 136 of the 1949 Acts of the Legislature, the statute in effect governed the dependent widow's rights because it was in effect at the time of the death.</SPAN></P>

The mayor and the council members refused to reinstate the chief, and he filed his petition for mandamus. The court granted the writ, holding that the chief's right to appeal the commission's decision under &sect; 13, Article 6A, Chapter 88, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1949 (West Virginia) was not an equally effective remedy that barred mandamus. The commission member who resigned was a de facto member and his vote was valid. But the member who held the disputed seat, who voted to uphold the chief's removal, was not a de facto or de jure member because he had replaced a member who had not been legally removed. Thus, a majority of the true commission members had not voted to uphold the removal.</SPAN></P>

The original mortgage fell due in 1914, and the makers' note fell due in 1925. The second maker, who was the payees' widowed aunt, died in 1952. The payees then sued to collect on the $ 700 debt, and the circuit court found in their favor. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the suit had been properly brought in an equitable forum. The admission of the testimony of the second maker's administrator, who was also the husband of one of the payees, was harmless error. The circuit court correctly refused to admit some payees' testimony. The note was not time-barred by Chapter 1, Acts of the Legislature, 1949, Regular Session (West Virginia).

The court held that the title of Chapter 147 clearly defined its object and purposes and the powers of the governing board. No fault could be found that the act contained matters not connected with its object, nor was it calculated to mislead any legislator or member of the public. Another objection invoked by the chairman related to the grant of eminent domain to public service districts. He argued that such a grant violated &sect;&sect; 9, 10 of Article II of the Constitution of West Virginia. Although private property could not be taken for private use, the court did not regard condemnation by public service districts as the taking of private property for private use.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with and convicted of second-degree murder after participating in a confrontation with non-union employees. The conviction was reversed and a new trial was awarded. The court held that the trial court erred in bringing in a jury panel from another county, because it had not been established under Code, 52-1-20 (West Virginia) that an impartial jury could not be had from the citizens of the county of trial. The court also held that the State proved sufficiently that defendant had fired the fatal shot. His rifle was the only one that was of the right caliber, and the fatal bullet matched the rifle. The trial court did not err in admitting defendant's confession, even though he claimed it was obtained by threats. There was error a jury instruction regarding self-defense, as it seemed to imply that the trial court had already found that defendant had committed the homicide by a deadly weapon. Another instruction, referring generally to strike violence, was erroneously given, and was not cured by another, proper instruction. Other claimed errors, pertaining to comments by State's counsel and whether conspiracy was improperly considered, were overruled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company operated trolley cars on the streets of three municipalities. With the trolley car system becoming obsolete, the company procured the adoption of ordinances in the three municipalities that provided for buses instead of trolley cars. The ordinances provided for the payment of certain fees on the basis of a seat mile tax or a tax in lieu thereof. Several years later, the Commissioner demanded payment of all seat mile taxes and registration fees, contending that &sect; 13, Article 10, of that part of Chapter 129, Acts of the Legislature, 1951, Regular Session, designated as Chapter 17-A, was contrary to the West Virginia Constitution. The circuit court ruled that &sect; 13, Article 10 was constitutional. In affirming the ruling with regard to the statute, the court held that its enactment was authorized by &sect; 9, Article X of the West Virginia Constitution. The municipalities had a right to collect the taxes for buses that operated wholly within their corporate boundaries. However, there was no requirement in the applicable constitutional or statutory provisions requiring that the ordinances passed by the municipalities allocate the taxes to roads or street purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the circuit court's holding that regarding the constitutionality of the statute. The court reversed that part of the circuit court's ruling that required that the municipalities allocate by ordinances the funds derived from the seat mile tax or tax in lieu thereof to street or road purposes.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the exclusive jurisdiction granted to juvenile courts by Code, 49-5-3, related only to trials on charges of juvenile delinquency, not to trials and punishment of juveniles for criminal offenses. The prisoner also argued that he was denied due process of law because he was not afforded the benefit of counsel as guaranteed under &sect;&sect; 10 and 14 of Article III of the Constitution of West Virginia, as well as the Federal Constitution. The record showed that the indictment was read to the prisoner before the acceptance of his plea and that it was the invariable practice of the trial judge who accepted the plea to advise minors appearing without counsel of their right to have counsel. The court held that the right to assistance of counsel could be waived, and an accused's failure to request the assistance of counsel was a waiver of such constitutional guaranty.

At issue was whether the awards in favor of each claimant for silicosis in the first stage were payable from the Workmen's Compensation Fund and chargeable to the account of the employer or were payable from the surplus fund provided for by the Workmen's Compensation Law. The court found that &sect; 1, Article 3, Chapter 23, Code, 1931 (West Virginia) provided for the creation of a surplus fund to cover the catastrophe hazard, the second injury hazard, and all losses not otherwise specifically provided for in Chapter 23. The instant claims for silicosis in the first stage did not relate to a catastrophe hazard within the statutory definition.

Instead, the Senate took up the prior governor's letter reappointing the incumbent, and it confirmed his nomination. The attorney general sought a judgment of ouster, but it was ruled that the incumbent had a lawful right and title to the office, so the attorney general sought review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original proceeding for a writ of mandamus brought by the State of West Virginia on relation of relator State Road Commission, the court (West Virginia) considered whether to require respondent, Secretary of State of West Virginia, to affix his seal to toll bridge revenue bonds issued by the Commission. The main issue was whether such procedure was a contraction of a debt by the State prohibited by Article X, &sect; 4 of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The toll bridge would provide a river crossing for a state highway and the bonds were issued pursuant to Code, 17-17, as amended. After reviewing precedent from other jurisdictions, the court concluded that they were unanimous in holding that a constitutional fund could be pledged to the payment of revenue bonds without violating the debt provisions of those state constitutions containing language similar to that in Article X, &sect; 4. The court pointed out that the West Virginia State Road Fund, which was pledged to pay any deficits in principal and interest from toll bridge revenue bonds, was a constitutional fund implemented by the provisions of Code, 17-17-22, as amended. Further, the resolution providing for the issuance of the bonds and the words contained in them made it clear to all who purchased them that they were not general obligations of the State and did not pledge the full faith and credit of the State. The court held that, because neither the general revenues, nor any other revenues of the State, were committed to the payment of the principal and interest on the bonds, the bonds were not a general obligation of the State. No debt inhibited by Article X, &sect; 4 was created.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original proceeding brought by petitioner, the Board of Governors of West Virginia University, to compel defendant state auditor to honor a requisition submitted to him by the president of the university and executive officer of the Board in favor of an association of colleges and secondary schools to pay the university's dues as a member of the association for one year, the court (West Virginia) considered whether mandamus should issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As to whether the expenditure of public money for the payment of the dues was for a public purpose, the court concluded that the purposes of the association were the furtherance of education in universities, colleges, and secondary schools, and, to the extent that they were accomplished, they improved the system of public education in West Virginia, including the state university. The court noted that the testimony of the witnesses showed clearly the numerous benefits that accrued to the state university from membership in the association and the resultant detriment to the university if it should cease to be a member. The court concluded that membership tended to improve and promote the state's public education system, and, in consequence, was for a public purpose and did not violate any provision of the Constitution of West Virginia. The court ruled that, because a requisition, regular in form, for the payment of the dues had been authorized and approved by the Board of Public Works and the Budget Director, and there were sufficient unexpended funds in the state treasury appropriated for that purpose, the state auditor had to honor the requisition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original proceeding, petitioner relators sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to issue a Class A registration for an automobile that leased to a bank, claiming that the Commissioner's ruling that they were only eligible for a commercial permit and a Class U registration under W. Va. Code &sect; 24A-6-6 violated their rights under the state and federal Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner denied the relators' request for a Class A registration, ruling that they were only eligible for a Class U registration for the passenger car they had leased to the bank. The relators claimed that the Commissioner erred because they were not contract or common carriers that transported people or property, nor was the vehicle leased to the bank on that basis. They claimed that they were deprived of equal protection and of their property without due process in violation of U.S. Const. art. XIV and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 9, art. VI, &sect; 30. In a case of first impression, the court agreed and issued the writ of mandamus, ruling that the provisions of W. Va. Code &sect; 24A-6-6 as applied to the relators imposed an unconstitutional burden on them and their property. The effect was to place a holder of a Class U license in the category of a common or contract carrier even though it was not one and under the lease could not have operated as one. The Commissioner did not have the power to turn a private carrier into a public one, making its business subject to regulation. This was not properly done by legislative fiat because it deprived the relators of their property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court awarded the relators a writ of mandamus to compel the Commissioner to issue a Class A registration for the automobile that they leased to the bank.</SPAN></P>

A requisition was made for compensation during her leave.

The auditor argued that &sect; 12 violated W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 6, which prohibited the assumption by the state of any debt or liability of any county, city, township, corporation, or person. The court disagreed. The granting of sabbatical leaves for the furtherance of graduate work by faculty members of state educational institutions and the use of public money to defray the expenses of the faculty members while on sabbatical leave were for a public purpose and such service in the field of public education was beneficial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of gambling crimes under W. Va. Code &sect; 61-10-11. He appealed, arguing that he was immune from prosecution under W. Va. Code &sect; 57-5-2 based on an order of the circuit court that granted him immunity if he testified about the gambling crimes before the grand jury. The State argued that defendant never testified regarding the crimes charged and therefore was not immune. Defendant was convicted, and on appeal, the court reversed the judgment and set aside the verdict. The court held that although the questions asked by the prosecutor did not expressly criminate defendant, inherent in the questions was the idea that defendant was being asked whether he had paid for protection to operate an illegal business. The legislature intended that a witness be given immunity from prosecution that was coextensive with the privileges the witness would have enjoyed under the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5, if the statute had not been enacted. Defendant was not required to assert the privilege of immunity as a personal privilege in order for it to be effective. Also, his not guilty plea to the indictment did not waive the privilege.</SPAN></P>

The court awarded the claimant the writ directing the state auditor to pay the appropriated funds, deciding that the legislature's appropriation of money for personal injury caused by its employee while acting within the scope of his duty was proper. The court explained that such a claim was able to form the basis of a valid moral state obligation that justified legislative appropriation of public funds. The court further found that the legislature's adoption of the state court of claim's finding that the penitentiary guard was negligent was supported by the evidence and any conflicts in the evidence had to be resolved in favor of the legislative action as if it had been a proceeding at law between private persons.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner was given a life sentence. He filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that he was tried twice for the same offense. The court held that the question of former jeopardy could be raised on a proceeding in habeas corpus, and the crimes with which the prisoner was charged were not identical. The judgment sentencing the prisoner to life imprisonment was not void but was valid on its face. Therefore, that judgment was not open to collateral attack. If an accused relied on former jeopardy, which was based upon a different indictment in the same court or upon a warrant or indictment in another court, a special plea had to be tendered.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father was convicted by a justice of the peace of nonsupport of his two minor children, and the judgment required the father to pay monthly sums for support. The father appealed, executing the appeal bond required by the West Virginia nonsupport statute, W.Va. Code &sect; 48-8-4, as amended, which bond was also executed by the sureties. Upon the trial in the circuit court, before a jury, the father was again convicted of the offense charged, and the sureties sought a writ of prohibition to prohibit the enforcement of the judgment upon the bond. The court held that while W.Va. &sect; 48-8-4, as amended, was constitutional, the judgment of the circuit court in so far as it applied to any liability of the sureties accruing subsequent to the entry thereof, was in excess of the circuit court's jurisdiction and was thus void. The court found that the circuit court was authorized to require the father to make support payments in the amount determined by the circuit court judge but that the sureties were not to be held in any event as to any amount greater than the penalty of the bond. The court thus concluded that the sureties were entitled to the writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The medical licensing board brought proceedings against the physician, who was licensed under W. Va.

The trial court overruled the physician's demurrer and certified two questions regarding whether &sect; 30-14 authorized the osteopathic physician from prescribing medicines and performing surgery in the same manner as allopathic physicians. On review, the court remanded with directions to sustain the demurrer. The court stated &sect; 30-3 provided that only physicians and surgeons could practice medicine, and that the article did not apply to osteopaths. The court stated &sect; 30-14 regulated osteopathy, and afforded osteopathic physicians and surgeons licensed hereunder the same rights as physicians and surgeons of other schools of medicine. The court ruled that, pursuant to common law, the two provisions should be construed together and read in pari materia so that neither failed, and concluded the osteopathic physician had the right to practice his profession to treat any human ailment as allopathic physicians may have done under &sect; 30-3.</SPAN></P>

The court found that petitioner having assumed, as he had the right to do by reason of his election, the office of justice of the peace, he did so in contravention of the inhibitory provisions of the Charter of the City of Weirton, and it thereupon became the right and duty of the council to declare petitioner's office as councilman vacant and to appoint a qualified person to fill the vacancy.</SPAN></P>

The landowner brought a declaratory judgment action challenging the validity of the assessment, and defendants' demurrers were overruled. Upon the parties' joint application, the cause was certified to the court, and the court held that Chapter 89, Article 8, Acts of the West Virginia Legislature, 1949, Regular Session, was a valid exercise of the constitutional power of the West Virginia Legislature, and thus, the assessment was valid. The court also found that the landowner was estopped from challenging the assessment because he initiated the improvement, he had the opportunity to keep in touch with the paving as it progressed, and he had a duty to make timely protest, or take other action he thought necessary before the contract was let and the work completed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner applied for a license to conduct a horse race meeting at his track. The Commission denied his petition. The Commission found that 1953 W. Va. Acts (Act) would become effective before the track was completed and before a horse race meeting was held at it. Therefore, the Act applied to the track. Pursuant to the Act, the owner would have to apply for a construction permit and would be subject to a local option election. Plaintiff filed for a writ of mandamus to compel the Commission to issue the license, alleging that the Act was unconstitutional. The court denied the writ. Although the Act did not apply to existing licensed race tracks, it did not violate equal protection and was not a special law pursuant to W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 39, because it applied uniformly to all new racetracks. The fact that the owner would be subject to a local option election was not an unconstitutional restriction because regulation or prohibition of race tracks conducting pari-mutuel betting was within the State's police power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claim involved was against the State Road Commission for property loss sustained as the result of a fire that originated in a garage occupied by the Commission, which spread to and destroyed a store building owned by petitioner. The claim was based on the alleged negligence of an employee of the Commission in starting the fire and in failing to prevent the fire from spreading. The court held that a moral obligation of the State, declared by the legislature, was to have been upheld only where the conduct of the State's employees were such as would constitute negligence in an action for damages between private persons. Therefore, the court had to determine whether the conduct of the mechanic would constitute negligence in an action between private persons. The court concluded that the mechanic's actions were not negligent because the wholly unexpected fire occurred suddenly. The fire spread immediately to the clothing and the person of the mechanic who, as soon as he could extinguish the flames, attempted, though unsuccessfully, to extinguish the fire in the garage by the use of a fire extinguisher. Therefore, the appropriation by the legislature could not have been upheld.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner contended that the indictment under which he pleaded guilty, and under which he was sentenced to life imprisonment, was void. The court held that the indictment satisfied the provisions of Code, 61-2-12 (West Virginia), as amended, because the indictment charged that petitioner attempted by a felonious assault to steal, take, and carry away from the person of another property not belonging to him, which was just another way of saying that petitioner used violence in an attempt to commit robbery. Petitioner contended that Code, 61-2-12, as amended, was unconstitutional as violative of the provision of Section 5, Article III, West Virginia Constitution. The court reasoned that as under Code, 61-2-12 (West Virginia), the trial court had discretion to impose a minimum sentence, or a sentence of conviction for life, the provisions of that paragraph were not unconstitutional. As the statute prescribed only minimum penalties, leaving it to the court to say what the punishment was, the court could not say that the judgment was violative of the Constitution.

The court held that an appellate court only was permitted to consider objections that were raised and reserved in the lower court and further found that such errors were considered waived by the objecting party.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The auditor refused to honor a draft of the Board on the ground that the budget act was unconstitutional because, 1) the act created an unconstitutional deficit; 2) the act contained invalid amendments to a budget bill; and 3) an item claimed for payment was not set forth in the budget bill or in the budget document. The parties disputed over &sect; 51 of Article VI of the Constitution of West Virginia, the budget amendment, which prohibited a budget bill that created a deficit. The court held that a budget act could never create a deficit in violation of the heart of the budget amendment. Moreover, the words shall not, used in the first paragraph of the budget amendment was given their general and ordinary meaning, which prohibited the Legislature from appropriating any money out of the treasury except in accordance with the provisions of the budget amendment. Finally, Sub-Section B of &sect; 51 clearly mandated that in no circumstances shall the Legislature amend a budget bill submitted to it by the Board of Public Works so as to create a deficit. Consequently, all of the items in the budget act, other than those relating to the Legislature and the judiciary, were held unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The tax commissioner demurred to the petition and the trial court overruled the demurrer. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded. The court held that it was manifest that the sale of particular types of tangible property by the electric power company, for the sole purpose of furthering its public service business, was not on the same plane with businesses selling tangible property solely for profit. The court held that the tax levied against the electric power company, under W. Va. Code &sect; 2(d), was determined solely by the amount of income received by it from sales and demand charges, and that its income from an activity merely incidental to its public service business was not included within its income from sales and demand charges and was not subject to any tax levied.</SPAN></P>

The company claimed that the locomotive had been inspected and that it was not injurious to the health or safety of miner's working in the company's mines. Petitioners sought a declaratory judgment declaring that &sect; 10, Article 2, chapter 22, Code, 1931 did not prohibit the operation of the locomotive in underground mines. The court examined the statute in question, and using statutory construction rules it held that Code, 22-1-10 prohibited the use of any products of petroleum and alcohol completely and any compound that in the opinion of an inspector would contaminate the air to be injurious to miners. The court held that the finding that there would be contamination applied only to any compound that had not been named, and the locomotive, because it used petroleum, could not be used in the underground mine, regardless of any alleged finding by an inspector.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The uncontradicted evidence introduced clearly showed that the waters of two rivers were polluted by untreated sewage from the city, which was discharged and flowed into those rivers. The court held that the finding to that effect by the Commission was neither arbitrary nor in excess of its statutory powers. The city contended that Article 11, Chapter 16, Code, 1931 (West Virginia), as amended, was unconstitutional in authorizing the Commission to require of the City, a municipal corporation with limited powers, action and financial expenditures which it was without sufficient authority or means to undertake or perform. The condition which existed was statewide, not local. The court reasoned that public health was a state affair rather than a municipal affair. In matters which did not concern the inhabitants of a municipality alone but which were of statewide interest or concern, a municipality could have been compelled to carry out the plans of the State and to perform the duties which it imposed. Therefore, the court concluded that the legislature had the right to allow the State to compel the city to improve its water facilities so as to stop the city from polluting rivers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The method contended for by the State Tax Commissioner for determining the proper value of assessments was referred to as the &quot;book value&quot; method, and consisted of the finding of the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock outstanding, the amount of surplus, the amount of undivided profits, the amount of interest earned but not collected, and the amount of any reserves, deducting from such aggregate the amount of interest accrued on time and savings deposits, the amount of unearned discount included in undivided profits, and the amount of the assessed value of real estate. The taxpayers arrived at their value by use of the so called &quot;sales price&quot; method. The court found that the specific direction of the legislature to a tax assessor under Code, 11-3-14 (West Virginia), as amended, was that the real and actual value of shares were to have been ascertained according to the best information that the assessor was able to obtain, whether by using a certain specified method or methods, or from some other trustworthy sources.

The court found that there was nothing precluding the legislature from declaring the debt to be a moral obligation of the State. The court rejected the State's argument that the tax structure of the State would be endangered by allowing such claim, holding that it was only through grace that payments of moral obligations were paid by the State.</SPAN></P>

The decedent's estate executor then filed a writ of mandamus to compel the state auditor to pay the claim.

The court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision awarding the state's petition. The court held that 1951 W. Va. Acts 166 was unconstitutional. The act was passed after the legislature had been in session 60 days, which was in violation of W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 22. Section 22 limited the period of time a regular session of the legislature could continue to a maximum of 60 days, unless extended by a vote of two-thirds of the members of each house. The court, in determining whether the legislature complied with constitutional requirements in the consideration or passage of a bill, was permitted to hear and determined the question of the constitutionality of the act by aid of extrinsic evidence. Because the act was passed more than 60 days after the beginning of the legislative session and there had been no vote to extend the session, the act was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State owned the lots in question when they were assessed to pay for the paving of the adjoining street, subject to an equity in redemption.

The circuit court overruled the property owner's demurrer to the city's bill, and the court affirmed the ruling. The court found that the lots were subject to an assessment against them for the paving work even though no enforceable lien was created against the State as owner of the property. Because the lots were assessed in the names of the previous owner and not the State, the initial assessments were void. The court then found that the lots could be reassessed under &sect; 13, Chapter 89, Acts of the Legislature, 1949.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hospital was transferred from its original owner. The Board contended that the right granted under the statutes to conduct an accredited school was not assignable and that the conveyance of the hospital failed to convey the right to operate the nursing school. Pursuant to Article 7, Chapter 96, West Virginia Acts of the Legislature, 1945, Regular Session, the Board was given the power to adopt rules necessary to establish the standards for operating a nursing school. Though technically not a license, the court determined that the right to operate such a school was similar to a license and was not assignable or transferable inasmuch as a license was regarded as a special privilege. Therefore, the court held that the hospital was not entitled to receive the license to operate the school by way of a transfer from the original licensee. Although the Board's motion to dismiss was not well-founded and was denied, the court held that the Board was entitled to have the demurrer granted inasmuch as the hospital's allegations were insufficient. Because the hospital's petition could not have been cured by amendment, dismissal was proper.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court, which held that &sect; 7, Chapter 6, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1933 (West Virginia), was unconstitutional and that the unconstitutionality vitiated the entire Act, dismissed the petition from the docket. The Commission brought a writ of error. The court found that &sect; 7 did not provide expressly or impliedly provide for a trial de novo or vest the circuit court with jurisdiction to determine whether a statutory pollution existed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commission was created pursuant to Chapter 39, Acts of 1937 (W. Va.). The legislature appropriated a sum to the Commission for membership in the Council of State Governments, and the chairman of the Commission submitted a requisition to the Auditor.

The Commission sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Auditor to honor the requisition. The court granted the writ and held that the Auditor was obligated to honor the requisition. Although the legislature lacked authority to delegate the State's police powers, the court found nothing in the Act that delegated such powers to the Commission. The Commission was not vested with the power to make any rule, regulation, or agreement. Everything the Commission was authorized to do had to be approved by the legislature. Therefore, the court was not warranted in interfering with the exercise of legislative power and discretion in the appropriation, which was clearly defined for a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it could not determine whether the valuations fixed on the lands of corporations result in inequality or lack of uniformity when compared with other lands, since the record is silent as to the true and actual value of the corporations lands, as well as the lands with which there was an attempt to compare them. The evidence was not sufficient to show that there was a general plan relating to the valuation of lands similar to the lands here considered.

The trial court overruled the Chief's demurrer. The court reversed, determining that the position of fire boss was separate from the position of mine foreman or assistant mine foreman and that the legislature intended that the positions be filled by different individuals. The fire bossing of a mine had to be done by a qualified individual employed for that specific purpose and not by a mine foreman, assistant mine foreman, or section foreman who acted as such during the same shift or day in the same mine or section. Although the practice of having a mine foreman fire boss mines was the least expensive method, the mine operators were required to bear the additional expense in carrying out the legislature's mandate.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court found that &sect; 5 was a reasonable and necessary provision, so as to prevent padded registration lists. It was important to fair elections that only those be kept on the registration lists who were entitled to vote. Section 5 was a reasonable exercise of legislative power and was constitutional. Section 43 of Article VI of the Constitution permitted the imposition by statute of duties on the county court of each county and the clerk thereof with reference to the registration of voters.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court considered the questions of whether the city's ordinances applied to a building project of the state office building commission, whether the legislature could delegate building and zoning regulatory police powers over property and structures of the building commission to the city, and, if the legislature could delegate such powers to the city, whether such delegation was invalid because of the absence of prescribed standards. The court held that the building commission was an agency of the state, was and would be acting in a governmental capacity, and was immune from suit. The court further held that the proposed building was a public building and the city's zoning ordinance did not govern. The court noted that to enforce the zoning ordinance would be to give the city council the unbridled power to enact ordinances as to building zones, such as they might deem proper.

The Commissioner demurred. The trial court sustained the demurrer. On its own volition, the judgment was certified for review by the Supreme Court of Appeals for West Virginia. The court upheld the judgment. The court found that the proceeding against the Commissioner, was in reality, a proceeding against West Virginia and was prohibited under Art. VI, &sect; 35, of the Constitution of West Virginia. The court reasoned that the Commissioner, by receiving taxes paid to him by the taxpayers, was engaged in the discharge of a governmental function on behalf of West Virginia, and was in his official capacity, a representative of the state. If the taxpayers were successful, the judgment would have been paid from the state treasury. The interest of the state was directly affected by the action and involved with respect to the funds in the treasury. The court held that Chapter 33, Section 8, Acts of the Legislature, 1933, First Extraordinary Session, Michie's Annotated Code, 1949, 11-13-8 was invalid and violated Article VI, Section 35, of the Constitution of West Virginia.</SPAN></P>

The Board claimed that the expenses were incidental to the athletic department in maintaining the athletic program in the administration of the affairs under the supervision of the department. The court granted the writ, holding that that it was proper for the auditor to issue his warrants, pursuant to the requisition for the payment of the claims, but that he had no discretion in the matter because he was a public officer charged with a mandatory duty in the premises. Although there was no express, specific authority contained in Acts of Legislature ch. 83. Art. 1-a, &sect; 2, Regular Session, 1943, authorizing the payment of such claims, it also contained no specific, express authority for the purchase of athletic uniforms or equipment. Under a fair appraisal of the statute, its provisions were broad enough to authorize the payment of the instant claims and was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Some witnesses heard defendant make threats toward the victim. Defendant was tried for first-degree murder and convicted. The conviction was reversed and a new trial was granted. The court first held that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction even though there was also substantial evidence to the contrary. There was no harmful error in introducing an empty shotgun shell that the sheriff had found close to the scene, as the issue was not whether defendant had shot the victim but whether there was enough evidence of premeditation, deliberation, and malice to support the conviction. A witness's pretrial statement that contradicted her testimony was properly admitted to show a purported attempt to lie and to show the jury the two different statements. However, the post-trial, racist statements of a juror, that he voted to convict because of defendant's race, constituted sufficient cause for reversal, even though the juror said on voir dire that he was not prejudiced. No one committed error at trial in not excluding the juror, as there was nothing on which to base such an exclusion.</SPAN></P>

The state auditor refused a requisition to make such appropriation effective. The State instituted a proceeding in mandamus to compel the auditor to honor the requisition. The court denied the writ, determining that by entering into the compact with other states, the legislature invalidly created an obligation or debt that was binding on future legislatures to make appropriations for the continuation of the activities of the commission, which amounted to the creation of a debt inhibited by W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 4. Through Chapter 38, Acts of Legislature 1939, the legislature, in adopting the compact creating the commission, impermissibly delegated a substantial part of its police power, so far as that power related to the control of streams, which power could be used by commissioners from other states in conjunction with commissioners appointed by the federal government. The legislature did not have the power to authorize the compact, which was null and void. As a result, there was no basis for the appropriation, the payment of which the State sought to enforce.</SPAN></P>

However, Chapter 83 also allowed county courts to incorporate municipalities of any size, not just 2,000 persons or less. Therefore, it violated &sect; 39(a) of Article VI of the West Virginia Constitution, which governed such incorporations. A certificate of incorporation from a county court would not confer upon the municipality the power to frame and adopt its charter. Therefore, it violated &sect; 39(a) and was void. However, since the county court was exercising a power or function that was legislative, a writ of prohibition did not lie.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the company should not have to pay contributions based on their service. The Director demurred to the company's pleas, and the demurrer was sustained. The court reversed on appeal, holding that the West Virginia Unemployment Compensation Act had indeed been amended to eliminate eligibility for seasonal employees who worked less than 100 days in a year or earned less than $ 100 in a year. Consequently, the court held that the Act also relieved the company from having to pay contributions on the wages of the seasonal employees.

The Board's inspection failed to discover the defect. In considering the matter, the court concluded that under &sect; 39, Article VI, of the Constitution of West Virginia, the statute in question was a private, special, and local statute, which provided that it had been passed because a payment to the carpenter was necessary to discharge the Board's moral obligation. The court explained that a valid appropriation could be made in the discharge of a moral obligation, which did exist in the instant case and which existed when there was a legal or equitable duty created by contract or resulting from wrongful conduct that was judicially recognized as legal or equitable in a case between private persons. The court also noted that the moral obligation did not justify an action at law against the Board because maintaining the bridge was a governmental function. The court ruled that the statute was unconstitutional insofar as it directed the Board to make the payment; insofar as it authorized the Board in its discretion to pay the carpenter, the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The State Tax Commissioner sought to recover overpayments of salary made monthly to the ex-commissioners. The court held that the circuit court properly determined the action. The court held that the county court was in fact the real plaintiff in the action. The ex-commissioners contended that the five-year provision of Code, 55-2-12 (West Virginia), barred a recovery of the amounts claimed to be due from each, with negligible exceptions. The court agreed. An obligation due the county court that was a private right had a statute of limitations of five years. The court held that there was a plain misjoinder of rights of action displayed by the allegations of the declaration resulting in a like misjoinder of parties defendant. What liability might have resulted from the facts alleged was in no way set up as a common liability. The ex-commissioners could not have been properly joined as co-defendants based upon conduct in which they could have had nothing in common.</SPAN></P>

The trainer argued that the racing commission rule providing for the suspension of a trainer whose horse had been drugged, without proof of individual culpability, violated the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After it won a race, the trainer's horse was found to have been administered a drug in violation of commission rules. The horse was disqualified, the purse was redistributed, and the trainer was suspended for six months as required by West Virginia Racing Commission Rule No. 248, with the result that she lost privileges to race horses in other states as well as in West Virginia. Alleging that she had not given her horse any drug, and had not known that it had been given a drug, the trainer claimed that Rule No. 248 violated the spirit and letter of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10, and U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV because it penalized her without any showing or finding that she had been responsible for the horse's condition. After finding that, as an exercise of the state's police power, the Legislature had delegated power to regulate horse racing to the commission, the court held that Rule No. 248 was an effective method of bringing about fairness in racing. Accordingly, the commission's promulgation of Rule No. 248 did not exceed the power delegated to it, and the imposition of a penalty without fault, provided for by the rule, was a valid exercise of the delegated police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the parties had entered into lease for the purpose of producing oil and gas, the lessee paid the lessee a percentage of the net royalties, less taxes imposed under 1939 W.

The lessee paid the amount of the principal claimed, but denied it was liable for interest. The trial court entered judgment for the lessee on the issue of interest, and the lessor appealed. The court reversed, holding that the unconstitutional tax was as inoperative as though it had never been passed. The general rule was that one who withheld money from the rightful owner should be liable for interest. Although the lessee had withheld the tax payments from the lessor in good faith, because the statute was void, the lessee had no right to withhold the money from the lessor and it was liable for interest.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that in order for a zoning ordinance to be valid, it had to bear some real or substantial relation to the public health, safety, or morals, or the general welfare of the area affected. The court stated that in this case, the denial of the permit was unreasonable and arbitrary because the area was principally devoted to industrial and business uses despite the residential zoning, and the landowners would have been unable to successfully use the land for residential purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The suit challenged the validity of Chapter 5, Acts of the Legislature, 1947, Regular Session (West Virginia), providing for the organization, powers and duties of the West Virginia State Apple Commission and levying a tax on commercial apples in excess of 500 bushels, grown in West Virginia and moved into the channels of commerce. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the bill of complaint and certified the ruling to the court. The court held that: (1) taxes had to be levied for a public purpose; therefore, it was incumbent on the court to determine whether the tax levied by &sect; 4 of the Act was levied for a public or private purpose; (2) the tax levied by &sect; 4 of the Act was levied for a private purpose and was unconstitutional; (3) the purpose of the statute, as disclosed by &sect; 3 of the Act, was for the benefit of growers of commercial apples who were engaged in a private business undertaking, and any money derived from the tax had to be expended for the purposes set forth in the statute, and no unexpended balance could be transferred to the general fund of the state treasury; and (4) the elimination of the taxing provision rendered the entire statute void.</SPAN></P>

The State brought the bill alleging that the land became irredeemable and therefore, subject to sale, under W. Va. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State published notice in the newspaper in connection with its intent to sell the real estate as irredeemable. Claimants made a general appearance in the cause, and filed their separate demurrers to the bill. The trial court dismissed, and the State appealed. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that any parties having an interest in the land lost all their rights and the said land became the absolute property of the State when it became irredeemable. Under W. Va. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 4, a judicial proceeding was necessary to sell the property without making the former owner or other interested people parties to the suit. Moreover, the provisions of 1947 W. Va. Acts 160, &sect;&sect; 11, 12, requiring the joinder of such parties, including the service of process on parties defendant and publication, was not required. Notice was still required for parties within the jurisdiction of the court who could have been located and served. Finally, 1882 W. Va. Acts 95, providing for a judicial proceeding for the sale of lands returned delinquent for the nonpayment of taxes, did not operate to create a contract between the State of West Virginia and the owners of the land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decree of the circuit court that dismissed the State's bill, and the case was remanded with directions for reinstatement of the action.</SPAN></P>

The railroad company claimed that the employee was not engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the accident and therefore, was not permitted to recover under the Act. The court determined that at the date of the employee's accident, he was employed in interstate commerce inasmuch as the principal part of the railroad company's business was in traffic intended for interstate commerce. The court held that the fact that the railroad company's entire line was entirely within the state failed to make it an intrastate carrier as to traffic carried over its lines and either received from or delivered to a carrier operating in interstate commerce. The amendment to the Act was intended to bring within the scope of the Act all employees whose work at the time of their injuries, although not in actual interstate commerce, was involved in any work in the furtherance of interstate commerce. In addition, the court held that any award received by the employee under state workmen's compensation laws was void under the Act, which governed the recovery of all employees engaged in work involving interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

In 1944, the parties entered into a written agreement with a refining company, so worded as to reimburse the lessee in the amount of $ 3,127.38 from the future proceeds of the lessors' royalty oil at the rate of $ 300 per month, that being the agreed amount of the taxes paid direct by the lessee under the Chapter 127 of the Acts of the Legislature of 1939 in behalf of the lessors, and to authorize the refining company, it not being the producer but being the purchaser of the oil royalty, to pay the tax against the lessors' royalty interest in the future, and charge it against them. The court held that the 1944 agreement was invalid because it was made solely to comply with the provisions of Chapter 127 of the Acts of the Legislature of 1939, which was held unconstitutional. The court further held that the rights of the parties rested upon the provisions of Code, 11-13-2a, under the terms of which the producer of oil was chargeable with three percent of its gross proceeds, the measure of which was the entire production in West Virginia, as distinguished from a working interest. Thus, the lessee owed the lessors the money advanced.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the mechanics' lien could have been enforced as any other mortgage indebtedness, even if an acceleration clause was automatic, as provided by W. Va. Code &sect; 55-2-5. The court found that such acceleration clause was for the benefit of the creditor and that it was not self-operative. The court held that the statute of limitations provided that no action to foreclose or enforce a lien for the assessment in any action when the last installment of such assessment had been due over five years.

</DIV>

The purchasers then executed the deeds to other purchasers. The purchasers claimed that inasmuch as the debtor had failed to redeem the property within the requisite time period, they were not entitled to set aside the deeds. The court determined that service of the legal process instituted against the debtor was filed with the Auditor of the State. Such service failed to satisfy the due process of law requirements under the XIV Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The court found that inasmuch as the debtor had not received some character of notice before its rights were affected by the proceedings, the tax sale was not valid; therefore, the purchasers never acquired legal title to the property and were not permitted to convey the land through the deeds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relators, certain state citizens and taxpayers, filed an original petition for a writ of mandamus against respondent secretary of state. Relators sought revocation of the secretary's certification for an election on a proposed constitutional amendment relating to secondary road improvements. At issue was whether the publication of the proposed amendment violated &sect; 2, Article XIV of the Constitution (West Virginia).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Although &sect; 2 required that a proposed constitutional amendment be published in some newspaper in every county at least three months prior to an election, publication for the amendment relating to secondary road improvement bonds did not take place until some two months prior to the election. In addition, publication did not take place in one county due to issues with the newspaper's editor. After the proposed amendment was placed on the ballot, the initial action for a writ of mandamus was filed. The court denied the writ, holding that a substantial compliance with the constitutional and statutory provisions as to publication was sufficient. Although the three month publication requirement of &sect; 2 was mandatory, a literal compliance was not required. In addition, under the facts of the case, a substantial compliance was had because there was much publicity surrounding the proposed amendment and the voters were not misled.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Mingo County (West Virginia), which dissolved a temporary injunction and dismissed its bill to enjoin defendant city and others from seizing plaintiff's automatic phonographs and pinball machines and for other relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city adopted an ordinance that imposed licensing fees upon each and every non-gambling machine or dice amusement device that was registered with the city clerk. Plaintiff owned 37 phonograph machines in the city. Plaintiff was required to pay a state licensing fee on the machines under Code, 11-12-10. Plaintiff alleged that city officials had threatened to seize its machines by reason of nonpayment of the city's licensing fees. It alleged it had paid the proper licensing fees to the state. Plaintiff sought to have the City of Williamson ordinance of February 22, 1935 declared null and void. Upon review, the court found that the city had a right to impose a license tax upon plaintiff's machines in excess of that imposed by the state. As Code, 8-4-13 stood, the city had the power to impose the license tax, even though the ordinance authorized the impositions of taxes in an amount greater than those imposed by the state for the same activity. The action of the city did not conflict with the laws of the state. There was no allegation that the tax imposed by the city was unreasonable or confiscatory.</SPAN></P>

As Chapter 60 was originally enacted, certain cities, including the city at issue, were excluded from its application. Although Chapter 173, Acts of the Legislature, 1939 (West Virginia), and Chapter 119, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1947, amended the city's charter to make Chapter 60 applicable to it, these acts were passed following the passage of W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 39-(a), which precluded the passage of local or special laws incorporating cities, towns, or villages or amending their charters. Chapter 119, Acts of the Legislature, Regular Session, 1947, and Chapter 173, Acts of the Legislature, 1939, were special acts that amended the charters of only particular cities, including the city at issue. They were thus in violation of W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 39(a) and were void. As such, the writ prayed for was denied.</SPAN></P>

While the case was pending, the individual died from causes other than the injuries inflicted upon him by the police officer, and the action was revived for the use and benefit of the individual's executor and executrix, who filed an amended declaration. The surety and police officer demurred to that declaration and filed three special pleas, to two of which pleas the city entered its demurrer. The court held that: (1) the language of the amendatory statute enacted by 1945 W. Va. Laws ch. 2, art. 7, &sect; 8 applied to the action instituted by the city in behalf of the individual, prevented its abatement, and authorized his personal representatives, after his death, to revive the pending action in their names and to prosecute it to final judgment; and (2) the title to &sect; 8 satisfied the requirement under W.
