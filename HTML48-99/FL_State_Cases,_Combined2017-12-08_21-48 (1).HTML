</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction and death sentence from the Circuit Court in and for Pasco County (Florida) for murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and his companions consumed an undetermined amount of intoxicating beverages and went to a store to rob it. Appellant shot the caretaker of the store and appellant's accomplice shot another occupant of the store. The group left the store, taking with them beer, cigarettes, and money. Appellant's conviction for murder in the first degree and resulting death sentence were affirmed. There was evidence that appellant had used intoxicating beverages, but there was no evidence that appellant was intoxicated. The robbery was carried out from a preconceived plan. Appellant was capable of reflection at the time of the homicides. An order of the trial court validly extended the time until a reasonable period after the appellate court filed its opinion. The grand juror did not have to be on the voting list when the indictment was returned. Appellant was precluded from informing the jury of the sentences imposed on his accomplices at closing argument. Appellant made no attempt to present this evidence at the sentencing hearing. The aggravating and mitigating circumstances were such that the infliction of capital punishment was warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence because: the trial judge did not commit reversible error in denying the requested jury instructions; the speedy trial rule was not violated; the grand jurors were qualified; and the imposition of the death penalty was not a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A judgment of the court reversing an opinion of the Circuit Court, Seminole County (Florida) and holding Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found the portion of Fla. Stat. ch. 28.33 that the U.S. Supreme Court found constitutionally objectionable was the portion dictating disposition of the interest earned. The court found this portion could not be validly severed from the portion providing that moneys deposited in the registry of the court shall be deposited in interest-bearing certificates at the clerk's discretion. The court also found the provision stating that all interest accruing from moneys deposited shall be deemed income of the clerk's office was inseparably connected to the portion authorizing the clerk to invest the money. The court further found it could not excise the constitutionally infirm portion, while leaving intact the portion providing that moneys deposited in the court's registry shall be deposited in interest-bearing certificates at the clerk's discretion, without doing violence to the legislative purpose. Therefore, the court held that this portion was also unconstitutional. The court noted that without this portion of the statute and in the absence of a court order, the clerk had no duty, or even discretion, to invest money deposited in the court registry in order to earn interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the circuit court and found that the statute was unconstitutional because the court could not excise the constitutionally infirm portion of the statute, dictating disposition of interest earned while leaving intact the portion providing that moneys deposited in the court's registry shall be deposited in interest-bearing certificates at the clerk's discretion, without doing violence to the legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Florida Dept. of Education and the State Board of Education, challenged a ruling of the Circuit Court in and for Leon County (Florida) holding the condition regarding a minimum increase in school funding set forth in the 1978 Fla. Laws ch. 78-401, &sect; 1, item 353A, to be unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the Florida Dept. of Education and the State Board of Education, challenged the lower court's ruling holding that an appropriation condition set forth in the 1978 Fla. Laws ch. 78-401, &sect; 1, item 353A, was unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 12. The bill guaranteed a minimum increase of 7.25 percent in school funding for all counties except those counties that had a millage value per student of more than 20 percent over the statewide average. Appellee, a school board, was one of four counties excluded from the increase. In reversing, the court held that the condition did not amend or modify the substantive law of Fla. Stat. ch. 236.081(6)(c)(1977), but was simply a one-time 7.25 percent guaranteed supplemental increase. The court found that the &quot;hold harmless&quot; provision of &sect; 236.081(6)(c) did not conflict with the concept of a guaranteed 7.25 percent increase for school districts with a public educational need as determined by the legislature, which need was readily apparent in the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, holding that the appropriations bill guaranteeing a minimum increase of 7.25 percent in school funding conditioned on millage value per student was not an unconstitutional amendment or modification of the substantive law of Florida, but noted that no further action was necessary since the funds had already been distributed in accordance with the appropriation condition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bankers filed an application with defendant banking and finance department for authority to organize a corporation to conduct a general banking business. Defendant denied the application. Plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in the district court, alleging that the controlling statutory provisions, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 659.03(1)(b) and (c), improperly delegated legislative authority to defendant. They also asserted that the procedures employed in evaluating their application deprived them of due process. The appellate court affirmed defendant's decision. This court affirmed, holding that it was clear from analyzing the statute that defendant implemented the law rather than made it and therefore, there was no improper delegation of legislative authority. The court held that the statute unmistakably applied to plaintiffs and that their due process attack on the procedures employed in their case was unwarranted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the appellate court which affirmed defendant banking and finance department's denial of plaintiff bankers' application, holding that the pertinent statute did not improperly delegate legislative authority to defendant and that plaintiffs were not deprived of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant representative sought review of an order from the Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee rental agency based on common law immunity and in favor of appellee employee based on immunity granted in Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11(1) (1977), in appellant's action to recover damages for her husband's death resulting from a work-related automobile accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While in the course of employment, appellant personal representative's husband was killed in an automobile accident. Appellee employee was driving the vehicle, which his employer had rented from appellee rental agency. Appellant sought and recovered workmen's compensation benefits from the employer. She then filed suit against appellees to recover damages for her husband's death. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. As to appellee rental agency, the workmen's compensation statute had absolutely no effect on appellee rental agency's immunity from suit under the common law doctrine barring suit against the owner of a rental vehicle leased by an employer who had paid workmen's compensation benefits. As to appellee employee, the trial court was correct in finding Fla. Stat. ch. 440.11(1) (1977), which granted immunity from liability to employees who negligently injure a co-employee in the course of their employment, to be constitutional. This section still provided a cause of action for gross negligence and did not violate the access to courts provision of the Florida constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order granting summary judgment for appellees, rental agency and employee, in negligence action based on death of appellant representative's husband was affirmed because immunity granted to owner of rental vehicle leased by an employer was not affected by workmen's compensation statute. Statute granting immunity to co-employee for negligent acts was constitutional in that it did not violate the constitution's access to courts provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the Dade County Circuit Court (Florida) order in favor of appellees that declared a recently enacted anti-drug trafficking statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135 (1979), unconstitutional. Appellant argued appellees lacked standing to challenge constitutionality, and appellees argued the statute violated the United States and Florida constitutions on several grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were charged with drug trafficking under Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135 (1979). Appellees brought motions to dismiss. The trial court responded with an order declaring ch. 893.135 unconstitutional on several grounds. Appellant challenged this by arguing the trial court erred in every ruling. Further, appellant claimed appellees lacked standing to bring a constitutional challenge before being convicted, because they then lacked a personal stake. The court disagreed and found standing existed. The court agreed with appellant that ch. 893.135(1)'s minimum mandatory sentences did not violate the cruel and unusual punishment clauses of U.S. Const. amend. VIII or Fla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17 by eliminating sentencing discretion. The court agreed with appellant that ch. 893.135(3) was not impermissibly vague and did not deny equal protection of the law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court agreed with appellant that ch. 893.135(3) did not violate separation of powers under Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3 or rulemaking under Fla. Const. art. V. &sect; 2(a) or the right against self-incrimination under U.S. Const., amend. V. The court reversed the trial court order and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's determination that the Florida anti-drug trafficking act was unconstitutional and remanded to allow appellant to continue prosecution because appellees' claims that the statute violated the United States and Florida Constitutions were not persuasive, although the court found appellees had standing to challenge the law at the pre-trial stage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant football team sought to enjoin a referendum placed on the ballot by appellee county for a tax expenditure plan taxing lodgings rented for up to six months, the revenues to improve a stadium. The court held that the plan complied with each requirement of Fla. Stat. ch. 125.0104(4)(c). Even though the agreement between appellant and stadium-owner city required appellant's consent for any renovation, which it lacked, the plan was still valid because the statute did not require that all aspects of the plan be feasible and permissible. The plan did not seek to transfer jurisdiction over the stadium or its maintenance from the city to appellee in violation of Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4, because the ordinance simply allocated certain tax revenues for renovation of the stadium. The referendum did not mislead and complied with Fla. Stat. ch. 125.0104(6)(b) by putting voters on fair notice. The plan did not violate the privileges and immunities clause or the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution, because the tax did not distinguish between residents and nonresidents; it was imposed on anyone who rented certain kinds of living space for up to six months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed both of the lower court decisions being reviewed because none of the points raised by appellant football team warranted reversal of the findings that the appellee's referendum and tax plan were in compliance with applicable statutes and not in violation of any constitutional provision.</SPAN></P>

The prosecution claimed that defendant waived the issue on appeal for failure to object to the bifurcated procedure at trial. Subsequent to appellant's trial, the court declared Fla. Stat.

Defendants moved to dismiss the charges, and the court granted the motion. The state appealed the order of dismissal as to the two counts charging defendants with a violation of Fla. Stat.

The court held that the trial court properly dismissed the charges but should have dismissed them on the ground that the prosecution failed to convey notice of the accusations with sufficient precision and clarity.

Appellants challenged the order on grounds that the use of special interest juries was unconstitutional and that the statute was too broad and vague in its determination of a nuisance. The court held that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 823.01(2) violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, because the use of special juries was a violation of due process. However, the court rejected appellant's claim that the statute was unconstitutionally broad or vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant joined with others who sought habeas corpus relief from allegedly unconstitutional death sentences. The court rejected any procedural basis for consolidating habeas corpus petitions. Joinder under these circumstances in future cases would distort habeas corpus beyond recognition and create a pernicious precedent. However, the court decided that disposition of defendant's petition would dispose of all claims for relief of those petitioners joined with defendant. Defendants' constitutional claims were all based on the assertion that the court requested and received information concerning capital defendants, which was not a part of the trial record or record on appeal. Even if the charges were true, as a matter of law the court's view of non-record information was totally irrelevant either to the court's appellate function in capital cases as it bears on the operation of the statute, or to the validity of any one death sentence. This court did not impose sentences. On evidentiary matters, its only concern was whether there was sufficient competent evidence in the record from which the judge and jury could properly find appropriate aggravating or mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petitions of defendant and the others for writs of habeas corpus and for other extraordinary relief, because the review of non-record information was irrelevant to the review of sentences.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with selling heroin. At trial, defendant moved to suppress the testimony of the police officers as to what they heard on the electronic monitor relating to the conversations between defendant and an undercover police officer in the defendant's house trailer. He argued that such evidence was inadmissible as constituting an unreasonable interception of private communications because of the failure of the police to obtain a prior intercept warrant for the electronic surveillance. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant was convicted. The appellate court reversed, holding that the electronic interception of the conversation in the trailer was unreasonable and violative of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. On further review, the court affirmed, holding that that defendant enjoyed a reasonable expectation of privacy that no one else was listening to the conversation in the home besides the undercover police officer and others present therein.

The court also held that there were no instructional errors in the case, inasmuch as the instructions did not require the jurors to impose death in the event no mitigating circumstances were found and did not preclude consideration of nonstatutory mitigating circumstances. Finally, the court held that imposing death upon appellant, who held the victim down while an accomplice fatally stabbed him and another stood watch, was not disproportionate. Although the accomplice who actually stabbed the victim received life, appellant's situation was different because he had previously committed two murders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's murder conviction and sentence were affirmed. His rights were not violated by the prosecution's failure to turn over the misplaced copy of a police report detailing the victim's dying declaration, the jury instructions were proper, and appellant's two prior murders justified imposing death on him and not on his two accomplices.</SPAN></P>

Appellants challenged the judgment of approval, and alleged that respondent's airport facility lease agreement were unconstitutional, that respondent violated Florida's government-in-the-sunshine law (sunshine law), Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 286.011, and that the court's consistently validating such bonds denied the state a fair trial. The constitutionality of respondent's lease agreements was a collateral issue outside the scope of the bond validation proceeding. There was no allegation that respondent as a body or through designated members met in violation of the sunshine law, and the record supported a finding that respondent followed the law in its final approval of the bond resolution. There was no merit in appellant's contention that the state was denied a fair trial. Therefore, judgment validating the revenue bonds was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision to validate bonds proposed by appellee redevelopment agency to finance land acquisition and improvements. The court held that appellee had authority to bring an action for bond validation, despite the fact that the city created appellee without prior approval by the county, because the county later ratified the city's actions. The court further held that appellee's use of eminent domain proceedings served a public purpose because the private uses proposed by appellee were not substantial enough to destroy the public nature of the project. The court held that appellee had a legitimate public purpose, to stop the spread of urban blight, and, thus, its use of eminent domain was constitutionally valid. The court found that appellee's proposed bonds did not constitute an ad valorem tax that required a public referendum because the ad valorem tax was not necessarily deposited directly into appellee's fund, but was merely a measure of the contributions the county and city promised to make annually from their general operating revenues. The court denied relief to appellants, state and homeowners' association, and affirmed the bond validation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, liquor manufacturer, had an oral contract with appellee distributor for the distribution of a specific whiskey. The contract was terminable at will. Fla. Stat. ch. 565.095(5), which required a liquor manufacturer to follow specific procedures before withdrawing a particular brand or label of beverages from a distributor or appointing additional distributors, was enacted subsequent to the existence of the contract. Appellant sought to either withdraw the whiskey in question from appellee or to add another distributor in addition to appellee. The trial judge held that the statute was constitutional and applicable to the parties and to the action appellant sought. There was no public purpose discernable in the statute of sufficient need to authorize an impairment of existing contractual agreements. Under the statute, appellant and appellee were no longer able to terminate their contract at will but were able to terminate only upon a showing of good cause to an administrative agency. Such impairment was unconstitutional, and the statute did not, therefore, apply to contracts in existence prior to the statute's enactment.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court upheld the challenged provision. On review, the court found that &sect; 39.04(2)(e)4 did not unlawfully delegate legislative authority and that the section did not violate the requirements of due process or equal protection. Further, the court found that ch. 39.04(2)(e)4 was not rendered ex post facto by providing enhanced punishments for a subsequent offense because of convictions occurring prior to the passage of the statute.

Defendants filed a memorandum in support of motion to dismiss, claiming the statute as interpreted was facially unconstitutional because there was no rational basis for distinguishing between males and females. The trial court agreed and held the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that legislative enactments were presumed to be constitutional. Thus, even where the statute was reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, one of which would render it invalid and the other valid; the court was required to adopt the constitutional construction. Therefore, even if there was an interpretation limiting the crime of prostitution to women, the court was obligated to abide by the alternative construction, which made no sex-based distinction. Accordingly, the order was reversed and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the regulatory measures imposed under ch. 496, pt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant putative father challenged the Florida trial court's dismissal on the pleadings of his action to adjudicate his paternity under either Florida's determination of paternity statute, Flat. Stat. ch. 742 (1977), or its declaratory judgment statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 86 (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant putative father sought to adjudicate his paternity under either the determination of paternity statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 742 (1977), or the declaratory judgment statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 86 (1977). The trial court dismissed his case on the pleadings, holding he could not bring the action under either chapter. The court affirmed that the determination of paternity statute was constitutional and did not deny a man equal protection of the laws. A father could achieve a determination of paternity by acknowledging the child as his or voluntarily providing financial support, unlike a mother who had to resort to litigation. Therefore, it could not be said the statute imposed disparate treatment on men and women who were similarly situated. The court reversed the trial court's denial of appellant's right to adjudicate paternity under ch. 86. The court held that a putative father who had shown a substantial interest in his illegitimate offspring could bring a declaratory judgment suit to adjudicate his paternity where it was necessary to assert some present right or interest against the party sued. To the extend that Loeffler was inconsistent with this decision, it was disapproved.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's order upholding the constitutionality of the Florida determination of paternity statute, reversed the portion of the final order denying appellant the right to bring a declaratory judgment suit to determine his paternity insofar as it was incident to the claims asserted against the defendants, and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoners claimed that Fla. Stat. ch. 944.485 abridged their right of disclosural privacy, was in violation of the prohibition on ex post facto laws, deprived them of property without procedural due process, denied them of the privilege against self-incrimination, and was an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. The circuit court upheld the validity of chapter 944.485, and appellants sought review on direct appeal. The court found that appellants' presumption that chapter 944.485 operated to increase punishment for prisoners whose crimes were committed prior to its effective date was mistaken because the purpose of the statute was not punitive. In addition, appellants' procedural due process arguments presumed a deprivation of liberty or property, but parole was neither. The court also found that the claim against self-incrimination could not be appropriately raised by individual inmates on their disclosure forms because such claims should ordinarily be made at the time that disclosure was sought. The court found that in enacting chapter 944.485, the legislature had prescribed sufficient standards and guidelines to comply with Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, sexual battery, grand larceny, and burglary, and sentenced to death. He challenged his conviction, contending failure to establish either adequate chain of custody of his hair samples or his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. First, the hair samples were relevant, and the record reflected no hint of tampering. Second, although the case against defendant was circumstantial, when considered in combination the evidence enabled the jury to reasonably conclude defendant's guilt was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In the sentencing phase, failure to certify defendant for a hearing on whether he was a mentally-disordered sex offender was not error as the record revealed no clear abuse of discretion. The jury charge did not unconstitutionally limit consideration of mitigating factors. The trial court's improper consideration of two aggravating circumstances did not render the sentence invalid, as there were two clearly valid aggravating circumstances, one contested but valid aggravating circumstance, and no mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged a trial court ruling refusing to let him serve as co-personal representative of an estate because of statutory residency requirements of Florida probate law, Fla.

The court held that the right to appoint a personal representative was not a fundamental right requiring application of the strict scrutiny test. The court further held that the distinctions drawn by ch. 733.302, 733.304 bore a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state objective in reducing delays and costs of estate representation and therefore did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The sections did not impinge on the testator's fundamental right to travel or abridge petitioner's right to pursue a livelihood. The sections did not violate U.S.. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, the privileges and immunities clause, because only those distinctions between residents and nonresidents that hinders development of a single union of the states are prohibited.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of Senate Joint Resolution 1305 as it applied to them in multimember House Districts 57-61. The court-appointed commissioner made findings of fact and concluded that the efforts of petitioners to prove the creation of the district unconstitutional were unsuccessful. He determined that the resolution at its inception did not operate so as to unconstitutionally minimize or cancel out the voting strength of the black members of the population by denying members of the black minority an opportunity equal to that of other residents of the district to participate in the political process and to elect legislators of their choice. The court found that the petitioners were not entitled to relief. The record revealed that the reason black candidates had not been elected was not because of racial discrimination but because they ran as Democratic candidates in a Republican area of the state. Petitioners failed to allege or prove that the disputed election plan was conceived or operated as a purposeful device to further racial discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were convicted of possession of more than 100 pounds of cannabis with intent to sell. Appellants moved to dismiss the information and to suppress evidence, contending that they were stopped on the authority of an unconstitutional statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 570.15 (1977), and that the warrantless search of the truck was unlawful. At the hearing, the testimony was in conflict on the issue of consent. The trial court believed the officer rather than appellants, and denied the motions. On review, appellants contended that ch. 570.15 denied equal protection by establishing a classification having no rational basis. The court held that the distinctions drawn by the statute, providing for inspection access to trucks used in agriculture but not to passenger vehicles, and requiring trucks and vehicles pulling trailers to stop for inspection, had a rational basis, and so the statute did not violate equal protection guarantees. Further, because there was no evidence of coercion or repeated requests for consent, the trial judge could properly conclude from the officer's testimony that appellants voluntarily consented to the search. Accordingly, the judgments were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of assignation in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 796.07(3)(a). At sentencing, she was found to be a habitual misdemeanant. Defendant appealed, contending the assignation statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. In holding the statute to be constitutional, the court found that the proscribed activity fell within the dictionary definition of the term &quot;assignation&quot; and that the prohibition was limited to conduct which produced lawless action, rendering it free of any U. S. Const. amend. I infirmity. Defendant's conduct clearly fell within the statute's prohibitions, thus, she could not reasonable argue she was denied adequate notice. Nor was the statute worded so loosely that it lead to arbitrary enforcement. Thus, the court found the statute constitutional. The court found defendant did not have standing to object to the witness's testimony based on an infringement of his constitutional rights. The court also affirmed the sentence as it found that defendant's prior conviction could be used to support incarceration, because she had made a knowing and voluntary waiver of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of reckless driving under Fla.

The trial court rejected appellant's contention that the statute was so vague and indefinite that it was unconstitutional. On review, the court found that to be constitutional, a statute was required to convey sufficient definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. The court concluded that ch. 316.192(1) was sufficient to apprise motorists in Florida of what conduct the reckless driving statute prohibited.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were both charged under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.34 (1977), with the criminal traffic violation of driving while their licenses were suspended. The suspensions, which resulted from appellees' failure to appear at their respective traffic violation hearings, arose under Fla. Stat. ch. 318.15. Appellees contended, and the trial court held, that ch. 318.15 was unconstitutional because there was no provision requiring a separate hearing after notice on the issue of the traffic violator's good cause for his or her nonappearance at a hearing for the traffic violation. On appeal, the court disagreed and found that there was no constitutional requirement that the state conduct a hearing subsequent to the failure to appear before suspending the violator's license. Therefore, ch. 318.15 was found to be constitutional. Accordingly, the causes were remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Certified Public Accountant (CPA) applicants, were denied licensure by the state board of accountancy because they had not satisfied the requirement of Fla.

Appellants, who argued that their employment with the Internal Revenue Service satisfied the statutory requirement, alleged that they were denied equal protection. The trial court dismissed the complaint and upheld the statute's constitutionality. The court affirmed. Fla. Stat. ch. 473.08(2)(c) (1977) did not deny appellants equal protection. The statutory classification was reasonable and ensured the general legislative intent to preserve public health, safety, and welfare and the specific legislative intent to only allow persons who met the applicable standards to practice as CPAs. It was the state legislature's prerogative to require a year's employment with a CPA practitioner. The court rejected appellants' argument that their federal employment necessarily qualified them under state law to practice public accounting in Florida.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed an order from the Alachua County Court (Florida) in which the court entered judgment finding Florida's Air and Water Pollution Control Act, Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating Florida's Air and Water Pollution Control Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 403.161(1)(a). The trial court dismissed the complaint, holding that section 403.161(1)(a) was unconstitutionally vague. On appeal, the supreme court reversed the judgment. According to the supreme court, the accepted test for vagueness was whether the statute was specific and clear enough to put persons of common intelligence and understanding on notice of the proscribed conduct. The supreme court continued and held that a statute enacted for the public benefit should be construed liberally in favor of the public even though it contained a penal provision. In construing the statute the supreme court found that the statute passed the vagueness test. The supreme court held that the term &quot;pollution&quot; was couched in commonly used words which conveyed adequate warning of the proscribed conduct when read in conjunction with the section creating the offense. Thus, the supreme court held that defendant was aware of the conduct that was prohibited. The supreme court, however, found a portion of the statute unconstitutional and struck that portion because it criminalized unintended conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a county commission member, sought review of a judgment from the Citrus County Court (Florida). The trial court denied appellant's motion to dismiss an action by appellee attorney general, who sought to collect a penalty against appellant for an ethics violation. The trial court also held that Fla. Stat. ch. 112.317(2), the provision under which appellee sought to recover the penalty, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state ethics commission found that appellant, a county commission member, altered the license of a contractor so he would not have to take a written competency examination. The commission concluded that appellant used his public office to secure a special privilege for the contractor in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 112.313(4) (1974). The appeals court denied appellant's petition to review the commission's action. Appellee attorney general brought an action to recover the penalty pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 112.317(2) (1977). Appellant moved to dismiss, alleging that chapter 112 was a bill of attainder and that the evidence before the commission was hearsay. The trial court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 112.317(2) was constitutional and awarded judgment to appellee. The court affirmed the trial court's order. Chapter 112 gave each party due process and thus was constitutional. Fla. Stat. ch. 112.317(2), which prohibited a party from raising defenses in a subsequent proceeding that could have been raised on appeal, simply codified the rule of collateral estoppel and was constitutional. Appellant could not collaterally attack the validity of the proceedings before the commission.</SPAN></P>

Following a hearing on the motions, the trial court entered its order holding the statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court. The court held that the trial court erred in finding that the statute was unconstitutional, and found that appellees were validly charged with a criminal offense pursuant to the statute. The court reasoned that the statute was no overly vague, and that a statute could satisfy due process requirements even though it contained general terms and did not furnish detailed plans and specifications of the act or conduct proscribed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Third District Court of Appeal (Florida) issued an opinion that held a proposed ordinance to set the county millage at four mills was constitutional on its face.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent taxpayer requested that petitioner board of county commissioners approve his initiative petition designed to set the county millage rate for the given fiscal year at four mills. Petitioner disapproved the form of the petition, finding that the proposal was invalid. On a writ of mandamus to the circuit court, the proposed ordinance was determined to be facially valid. The petition was circulated, and a referendum election was scheduled. Petitioner took exception to the circuit court's ruling. The appellate court affirmed, certifying the question for review because it was of great public importance. The court quashed the appellate court's decision because if the referendum passed, it would have become law without a resolution by the county commission. That was inconsistent with Fla. Stat. ch. 200.191(6), which stated that millages were to be fixed only by resolution of the governing body of the taxing authority in the manner specifically provided by general law or by special act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An ammonia gas leak occurred at a cold storage warehouse owned by defendant bailee and allegedly damaged food products owned by plaintiff bailors, several meat companies. Each plaintiff bailor sued defendant for negligence, claiming damages in excess of $ 10,000. By motion plaintiffs requested that Fla. Stat. ch. 677.403(1)(b) (1971) be declared unconstitutional and that the trial be conducted under a previous statute. The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion because it found that the statute created an impermissible classification between plaintiff bailors and that, therefore, the statute violated the equal protection clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and the equality clause of the Declaration of Rights of the Florida Constitution. The cases were consolidated for purposes of appeal. The state supreme court reversed and remanded the trial court's decision holding that no equal protection violation existed because it was rational and proper for the legislature to place the burden on the bailee to come forward with evidence of due care as to this class of bailors. Where the legislature decided to draw the line was of no consequence to the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner driver was charged with manslaughter by operating a vehicle while intoxicated, Fla. Stat. ch. 860.01, after an accident in which his vehicle collided with and killed two persons on the shoulder of a state road. After the accident, petitioner was taken to the county jail for a breathalyzer test, where he refused to consent to the test. He was taken to a hospital where a blood test was administered despite his repeated refusal to consent. The test results yielded a reading of 0.14 percent alcohol, above the level at which one was presumptively under the influence of alcohol pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 322.262(2)(c). Petitioner moved to suppress the results of the blood test. The trial court denied the motion, and the intermediate court affirmed the trial court's decision. On further appeal, the court held that petitioner was entitled to refuse the test and reversed the decision below. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 322.261, a person had the absolute right to refuse consent to a chemical test if he or she were willing to accept the consequence of a three-month suspension in driving privileges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a taxpayer who owned car dealerships through corporate entities. One of the dealerships was located in West Virginia, while another was located in Florida.

An administrative hearing was held, and the hearing officer ruled that petitioner was commercially domiciled in Florida for the tax years at issue. An appellate board affirmed that decision. After being denied relief from that ruling in the appellate court, petitioner applied for a writ of certiorari. The court affirmed, stating that petitioner's gain from an out-of-state sale of stock held by a foreign corporation doing business in the state was taxable under the corporate income tax code because petitioner was unquestionably a resident of the state at the time of the sale and its entire payroll was in Florida.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that petitioner's classification of condominium units within the residential class was reasonable. The rates for trash collection were uniform within the residential class, and they did not deny condominium residents equal protection under the law. The appellate court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that the ordinances were unconstitutional because they imposed garbage collection fees which were disproportionately higher on condominium residents than the fees charged for the same bulk service to businesses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The spouse of appellant wife conveyed homestead property owned in his sole name to appellant wife and himself as tenants by the entirety. Appellant wife did not join in the conveyance. After the spouse's death, appellee, the deceased's son, filed a declaratory action wherein he sought and was granted an order declaring the conveyance declared null and void on grounds that joinder in such a conveyance by the spouse was required under Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 4(c). After a grant of summary judgment for appellee wherein this decision was upheld on appeal, the court found that the constitutional provision required joinder only when homestead property was being alienated and not when the property was transferred to the husband and wife as tenants by the entirety. The application of joinder to an interspousal transfer was not rational or necessary to protect the homestead heirs. Fla. Stat. ch. 689.11(1) was consistent with the constitutional provision as construed by the court. Judgment voiding the deed transfer was, therefore, reversed and remanded with directions to vacate summary judgment and to enter judgment consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Court (Florida) that denied defendant's motion to dismiss her indictment, denied defendant's motion to quash the petit jury panel and sentence imposed, and upheld the constitutionality of the state's jury selection statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to serve 5 years in prison and 10 years on probation following her plea of nolo contendere to second degree murder for shooting and killing her victim. Defendant alleged that the denial of her motion to dismiss was in error because Fla. Stat. ch. 40.01 (1977) was unconstitutional based upon minority underrepresentation of foremen and members of grand juries. Defendant's statistic did not show substantial underrepresentation for a significant period of time either as a matter of law or as a matter of fact. The classification of young adults she alleged to be underrepresented did not constitute a cognizable class. Defendant, therefore, failed to meet the threshold burden for showing a prima facie equal protection violation regarding the presence of minorities on grand juries. Defendant also alleged error in the court's imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence where the indictment failed to advise defendant of a mandatory minimum sentence. There was no requirement of such notification under state law. Therefore, defendant's conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were indicted by a statewide grand jury for violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 943.462. Two of the appellees were charged for acts that occurred after the effective date of RICO. Because the indictment tracked the statute and alleged the existence of a criminal enterprise, the court held that the two appellees were sufficiently on notice as to the nature of the charge against them. Thus, the indictment was sufficient to charge a RICO offense against the two appellees. The remaining eight appellees were charged for offenses that occurred prior to the effective date of RICO. The court held that RICO could not be retroactively applied when none of the alleged offenses occurred after the effective date of the act. The court affirmed the dismissal of the RICO charges against the remaining eight appellees because the alleged violations of the act took place prior to its effective date. The court further held that the trial court correctly dismissed counts 2 through 10 because only single-county offenses were alleged and precedent required allegations of multi-county activity to support statewide grand jury jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the dismissal of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organization (RICO) charges against two appellees and affirmed the dismissal of the RICO charges against the remaining appellees. The trial court erred in dismissing the RICO charges against two appellees based upon a failure to properly allege a pattern of racketeering activity because the indictment tracked the statute and gave sufficient notice of the charges.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed his convictions, but remanded for resentencing. Appellant was almost 16 years old and mildly retarded. During the guilt phase, the state showed by a preponderance of the evidence that appellant's confession was freely and voluntarily given, and he knowingly and intelligently waive his right to remain silent and his right to counsel. He waived his objection to the judge's allegedly improper remarks to the jury, and the prosecution did not ask an improper question on cross-examination as direct examination opened the general subject. During the sentencing phase, the trial court erred in finding as two separate aggravating circumstances that the murder was committed during a robbery and that it was committed for pecuniary gain. Further, the trial court gave undue weight to the jury's recommendation of death. The court's failure to independently decide whether to impose the death penalty required that the sentence be vacated and the cause remanded to reconsider imposition of the death sentence in accordance with Fla.

Petitioner moved for a judgment on the pleadings, or in the alternative, a summary judgment, based on the statute of limitations under amended Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(b). The trial court held that ch. 95.11(4)(b) applied to the facts in the case but denied petitioner's motions on the ground that the statute violated respondent's right of access to the courts for redress of any injury under Fla.

The court affirmed and held that ch. 95.11(4)(b) showed no express, clear, or manifest intent that it be applied retroactively so that the four-year limitation period could not be applied to a medical malpractice claim where the occurrence or incident out of which the claim arose predated the effective date of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased's will devised his estate to his adult children and nominated appellee son as personal representative. The deceased did not bequeath anything to appellant wife of seven months. The will was admitted to probate and appellee was appointed as personal representative. Appellant petitioned to set aside homestead, to award a family allowance, and elected to take a widow's share, but appellee objected to said petitions because of an antenuptial agreement. Appellant attacked the agreement claiming that the deceased did not make a fair disclosure of his wealth and that Fla. Stat. ch. 732.702(2) was unconstitutional. The circuit court found that chapter 732.702(2) was constitutional, and appellant sought review. The court found that appellant was not denied access to the courts because the legislature did not abolish her right to sue, but merely altered one of the elements to be considered in determining the validity of the antenuptial agreement, and there was no Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 violation. The court found that there was a rational relationship between the classification in chapter 732.702(2) and the permissible statutory objective of regulating descent of property.</SPAN></P>

The Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) affirmed the order, and the JIC subsequently adjudicated petitioner permanently and totally disabled. Respondent employer appealed the JIC's ruling to the IRC. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.271 (chapter 440.271), the IRC transferred the case to a specific appellate court. Petitioner moved to dismiss the appeal, alleging a lack of jurisdiction in that court and charging the unconstitutionality of chapter 440.271. The lower court upheld the constitutionality of chapter 440.271, but then certified the question of whether the statute was constitutional. The court answered the question in the affirmative, holding that, inter alia, because the workers' compensation system was a legislatively created mechanism, the legislature could permissibly choose one particular appellate court to hear all workers' compensation appeals.</SPAN></P>

The state alleged that she had failed to disclose her husband's employment in order to obtain state assistance in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 409.325(1)(b) (1977).

Defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere and appealed the denial of her motion to dismiss. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling. The court held that the statute made clear that disclosure was necessary if eligibility for financial assistance was affected.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two juvenile dependency cases came before the lower state court. In one case, the unmarried parents of a child were found to be unfit and their parental rights were terminated. In a second action, a child was put in the temporary custody of the state to be eventually returned to his mother. In accordance with a decision of the federal district court, the state court directed payment of attorneys fees for the representation of the father and child in the first case and the mother and child in the second case. The State appealed the mandate of the lower state court ordering it to pay attorney's fees in juvenile dependency proceedings for indigent children and parents. The court held that counsel should be appointed only when parents were threatened with permanent loss of custody or when criminal charges could arise from the proceeding and on a case-by-case basis in all other circumstances. Also, the court ruled that the county rather than the state bore the burden to compensate appointed counsel. The court further determined that the federal court should have refrained from creating this new constitutional right and allowed the claim to be presented in the state system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The holdings of both the state lower court and the federal court that all indigent participants in juvenile dependency proceedings were entitled, as a fundamental right, to have counsel supplied to them by the state was rejected. Rather, a right to counsel only arose where the proceedings could result in permanent loss of parental custody or criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Appellee resident alien attorney and member of the Florida State Bar's application for a notary public commission was denied. The court held that the Equal Protection clause protected aliens and that classifications based on alienage were inherently suspect and subject to strict scrutiny. The court stated, however, that if the limitation was against alien participation in a public office that formulated, executed, or reviewed public policy or exercised discretion, that state need only show a rational relation. The court found that a notary public's duties were not discretionary and did not affect the state's constitutional responsibility for establishing and operating its own governmental and democratic political institutions and thus, the constitutionality of the citizenship requirement of &sect; 117.01(1) was correctly measured by the strict scrutiny test. Finding that the requirement violated equal protection, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that found the citizenship requirement of the notary public statute violated the Equal Protection clause. The court held that when a notary public's duties were not discretionary and did not involve the establishment or execution of public policy, the alienage classification was properly viewed under the strict scrutiny test.</SPAN></P>

The court also rejected appellant's suggestion that a person of ordinary intelligence could not ascertain when repeated criminal conduct became interrelated. The court held that the definition of &quot;pattern of racketeering activity&quot; incorporated federal case law that required the incidents to be interrelated, and not isolated, and that the federal courts had upheld this definition. The court rejected appellant's argument that the statute was overbroad when it included numerous misdemeanors that were not related to organized criminal activity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the owner and employees of a junkyard, were charged by information with the failure to keep records on a junk vehicle under Fla. Stat. &sect; 319.30 (1979). Appellants filed a motion to dismiss the charges, challenging the statute as being unconstitutionally vague and an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. The motion was denied and, after reserving their right to appeal, appellants entered pleas of nolo contendere and were placed on two years probation without adjudication. The court affirmed, finding that the test of vagueness of a statute was whether the language conveyed sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and purpose. The court held that the statute had to give reasonable notice that a person's conduct was restricted by the statute. The court found the statute was not vague. The court held the statute was valid exercise of the state's police power. The court found that the record-keeping standards and guidelines prescribed by the statute were sufficiently specific to overcome appellant's unlawful delegation of legislative authority challenge.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the State filed a notice that it wanted defendant declared a habitual offender, under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084. Defendant asserted that the Habitual Offender Act did not offer him the due process rights accorded an accused in a criminal trial determining guilt. Affirming the trial court conviction, the appellate court held that the Act was constitutional and defendant had not been denied any procedural rights. The court explained that defendant was not entitled to a trial by jury or the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on the question of whether he was an habitual offender. Defendant provided no case law to show that rights under the Act were expanded. In addition, the habitual offender proceedings did not require that defendant be offered the full panoply of rights afforded a criminal during his trial as to guilt. The court concluded that the procedural safeguards afforded to appellant by Fla. Stat. ch. 775.084 were adequate and were in accordance with the due process requisites announced by the United States Supreme Court in similar circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 365.16(1)(b) (1977). The state filed a motion to dismiss the information, alleging that the statute was facially overbroad in violation of Fla. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 4,9, and the U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. The trial court found that ch. 365.16(1)(b) proscribed pure speech, contrary to case law only allowing prohibitions upon obscenity and fighting words, and was overbroad. The state challenged this determination. The court disagreed that this statute governed pure speech, because it prohibited the conduct of making one or more telephone calls for improper reasons. The court found the law was not overbroad, because it specifically described the prohibited misconduct and served the legitimate purpose of protecting the called party's privacy interests from non-informative calls. The court found that these protections justified any minimal harmful effect of the law upon the freedom of expression and speech. The court held the statute constitutional, reversed the trial court decision, and remanded for further consistent proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with petitioner and found chs. 332.261,262 provided a constitutional delegation of power to the agencies to approve and implement blood intoxication tests. The court held proper the legislature's statutory scheme to authorize and facilitate such testing and procedures subject to judicial review.

Appellant hired a third party to kill a police officer. The court rejected the argument that the search of appellant's house was improper.

The court further found the search warrant met the test for issuance based on an informant's tip. The court explained the allegations established a basis for concluding the informant was credible and had reliable information. The court rejected the argument that appellant's statements were obtained in violation of his privilege against self-incrimination. The court found appellant's actions reflected complete understanding of his situation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two cases involving juvenile defendants were consolidated for review because both cases involved the constitutional validity of Fla. Stat. ch. 39.04(2)(e)4. The issue for review was whether the state could constitutionally vest the state attorney with authority to criminally prosecute a juvenile who was 16 years of age or older as an adult, under Fla. Stat. ch. 39.04(2)(e)4, when the juvenile had in the past committed two delinquent acts one of which involved an offense classified as a felony. On review, the court upheld the validity of the statute. The court reasoned that the legislature had, by statutory exceptions to the juvenile division's general jurisdiction over children, returned to the state attorney his traditional prerogative of deciding whom to criminally charge. The juvenile defendants also argued that the statute violated due process because it abandoned rehabilitative efforts. The court disagreed and held that the state attorney was not bound under the statute to prosecute a juvenile as an adult, he was free to exercise his discretion on an ad hoc basis. Also, even when a juvenile was convicted in adult court he was give special treatment as a juvenile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the constitutional validity of the statute at issue. The court reasoned that the statute adequately comported to due process and equal protection under the federal and state constitutions and did not constitute unlawful delegation of authority under Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

Officers arrested him without a warrant, under authority of Fla. Stat. ch. 901.15(6) (1977). Appellant was convicted of spouse battery and resisting arrest without violence. Appellant sought review because the trial court directly and initially upheld the constitutionality of ch. 901.15(6). Appellant alleged that his arrest was invalid due to the unconstitutional nature of the statute. He attacked it on equal protection grounds, contending that the classification, dealing only with spouses, was irrational. There was no suggestion that the statute failed to address the problem of domestic violence or that the members within the affected spousal class were treated differently. The supreme court rejected the contention that the statute had to apply to all parties who might have been involved with or affected by domestic violence. The statute had to merely apply equally to the members of the statutory class and bear a reasonable relation to some legitimate state interest. The statute satisfied the rationality test. The contention that the evidence was insufficient was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fla. Stat. ch. 409.2567 (1977) allowed appellant, the state department of heath and rehabilitative services, to provide child support collection and paternity determination services to persons not receiving governmental subsidies. The services included appellant's maintenance of suit, on behalf of an individual, to determine the paternity of dependent children. In such suits, counsel was supplied at no outright cost to the individual, but it was not provided to the respondent. The circuit court found that the practice was a denial of equal protection of the law and held that ch. 409.2567 was unconstitutional. Appellant sought review. The test used in examining whether a statutory classification satisfied Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, was whether it rested on some difference bearing a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation. The statute met the test. Because ch. 409.2561(4) allowed reimbursement of appellant's expenses out of support payments, individuals under ch. 409.2567 were not receiving free counsel. The statute suffered from no constitutional defect. The order was quashed and the cause remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an attack on a police officer, the government prosecuted appellants. Based upon a jury verdict, the trial court entered judgment convicting appellants of battery upon a law enforcement officer in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 784.07 (1977). The trial court passed upon appellant's constitutional challenges to the relevant statute when it denied their motion to dismiss. On appeal to the state supreme court, the decision of the trial court was affirmed. The state supreme court determined that precedential caselaw had already resolved the issue of whether the applicable statute violated equal protection by the special treatment it gave to police officers as victims of battery, in favor of the statute's validity. The state supreme court held that because the relevant statute had a scienter requirement, the statute conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to what conduct was proscribed.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that only two of the asserted grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel and racial discrimination in capital sentencing were cognizable for collateral attack because the other issues were or could have been raised on direct appeal and therefore were foreclosed in a proceeding for post-conviction relief. The court reversed the trial court to the extent that it denied appellant an evidentiary hearing on the issue of effective assistance of counsel. Appellant was entitled to a hearing on a Fla. R.

The veto of a proviso regarding inmate population violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 8(a), because it did not veto an identifiable appropriation, but only a qualification within a fund. Veto of a proviso related to the establishment of a new state supported teaching hospital was proper because it vetoed an entire appropriation and not only a limited portion thereof. A qualification to conditionally fund salaries of additional personnel for a government division did not constitute an appropriation, and veto of the qualification was not therefore constitutional. It was constitutional for respondent governor to veto a qualification for recreation and parks because the qualification represented its own specific appropriation. Vetoes of specified sums for purchase of books and scientific equipment for community colleges was constitutional because each sum was a specific appropriation amount.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with the crimes of driving while intoxicated and driving with unlawful blood alcohol level in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 316.193(1), (3). Appellant contended Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 316.193 was unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. Appellant contended Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 316.193 embraced more than one subject and therefore violated the single-subject requirement for laws. The court affirmed the lower court's decision finding Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 316.193 constitutional. The requirements of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 were met if each enactment of the legislature embraced but one subject and matter properly connected therewith. The requirement applied to laws in the sense of acts of the legislature. The restrictions did not apply when laws passed by the legislature were being codified for publication in the Florida Statutes.&nbsp;Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 316.193(1) regulated the use of state public roads and embraced only that subject matter. Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 316.193(3) embraced only the subject of driving while under the influence of alcohol.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the constitutionality of the statutes concerning driving under the influence. The statutes only embraced the matters contained within those statutes. The requirement that each enactment of the legislature deal with only a single-subject only applied to acts of the legislature and did not apply to publication of the Florida Statutes. It was not improper to publish both laws under the same chapter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state natural resources department challenged a trial court order, which declared unconstitutional portions of Fla. Stat. ch. 370 (1977), after appellee commercial fishermen sought declaratory relief and challenged the constitutionality of the statute. Appellees requested that proceedings against them in the county court be enjoined. Appellant's officer had arrested appellees for possession of undersized crawfish in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 370.14. The circuit court granted appellees' requested relief and declared that sections of the statute were invalid because the language &quot;have in his possession at any time&quot; was vague and failed to give sufficient warning of proscribed conduct. The appellate court reversed and held that the sections of the statute were constitutional exercises of the legislative power to regulate natural resources. Had the lower court correctly applied the definition of possession, it would have found that the term &quot;possession&quot; in ch. 370.14(2)(a)1 was neither vague nor ambiguous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Department of Transportation sought review of a decision from the First District Court of Appeal (Florida), which passed on the constitutional validity of 1974 Fla. Laws ch. 74-262, and an amendment to the statute enacted by the legislature in 1976 Fla. Laws ch. 76-174.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corporation filed suit under 1974 Fla. Laws ch. 74-262, claiming that a statutory amendment adjusting the contract price to be paid for bituminous materials for roads could not be retroactively applied. The trial court found that 1976 Fla. Laws ch. 76-174, an amendment to ch. 74-262, could not be applied retroactively because it would result in an unconstitutional impairment of contract. The court of appeal affirmed, and appellant sought further review. The court affirmed the appellate decision. The court held that ch. 74-262, as adopted originally and as amended, was constitutional under Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 10. The 1976 amendment, ch. 76-174, could not be retroactively applied without violating the constitutional prohibition against the impairment of contractual obligations. The benefits of the 1974 law, as amended by the 1976 act, ran to the public as well as to the road contractors. The court concluded that the 1976 amendment clearly affected existing contractual rights of the contractors who had entered into contracts with the state pursuant to the terms of the 1974 act, and the rights and obligations flowing therefrom could not be affected by the 1976 amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment that the statutory amendment at issue could not be retroactively applied was affirmed. The statute at issue, as originally enacted and as amended, was constitutional but the amendment could not be applied retroactively because to do so would result in an unconstitutional impairment of contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner doctors sought review of decisions from the First and Fourth District Courts of Appeal (Florida), regarding the question whether time limitation periods in Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners' rights to mediation were capriciously revoked based upon expiration of statutorily imposed jurisdictional time periods within the medical mediation act, Fla.

The statute did not allow for the tolling or extension of the time periods for any reason. The revocation of such a valuable legal right as mediation in such an arbitrary manner offended the right to procedural due process. The statute was deemed unconstitutional because application of its rigid jurisdictional time periods proved arbitrary and capricious in operation. Petitions for writ of certiorari were, therefore, granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitions for writ of certiorari were granted, and the decisions of the District Courts of Appeal, First and Fourth Districts, were approved, where petitioners doctors' rights to procedural due process were violated by an unconstitutional statute, which allowed for arbitrary revocation of the right to mediation.</SPAN></P>

Court held that the statute did not contravene the equal protection clause and that the classification of cannabis was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consulting firm was retained to conduct a nationwide search to fill a managing director position in a government agency. The television executive asked to examine the firm's papers relating to its search. After his request was denied, he applied for a writ of mandamus, alleging that the papers were public records under Fla. Stat. ch. 19 and were thus open to public inspection. The firm challenged the trial court's conclusion that the papers were public records and the issuance of a writ of mandamus, arguing that the papers were subject to a constitutional guarantee of personal privacy. On review, the lower appellate court reversed. The executive sought further review. In reversing and reinstating the order of the trial court, the court concluded that the right of disclosural privacy did not extend to the firm's records, which contained information concerning an official act of government. The consulting firm demonstrated no constitutionally protected interest sufficient to prevent the public from seeing its papers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was reversed because no valid privacy interest was asserted by the consulting firm.

Respondent challenged only the requirement that she pay court costs, on the ground that she had been adjudicated insolvent at her arraignment. The district court agreed with respondent and reversed that portion of the probation order. The court found that the district court cited a decision by the court where costs were assessed as part of a sentence of imprisonment, while in this case the costs were required to be repaid to the county as a condition of probation. The court found that the requirement to pay court costs as a condition of probation was not precluded by the wording of Fla. Stat. ch. 939.15, which directed the county to pay the costs of indigents. The court found that the requirement in an order of probation that a presently indigent defendant repay court costs to the county violated no constitutional guarantee, and as long as the probationer had the ability to pay, this condition was allowed by Fla. Stat. ch. 948.01(4) and 948.03 (1977), which authorized the trial judge to determine the terms and conditions of probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a judgment by the Circuit Court of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Seminole County (Florida), which granted appellee dismissal of charges against appellee for introducing phenmetrazine into a county detention facility in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 951.22 (1977) and holding that the statutory language referring to an excitative drug was unconstitutional due to impermissible vagueness and overbreadth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the hearing on appellee's motion to dismiss, the trial court heard testimony forming the factual basis for its conclusion that the term excitative drugs encompassed such things as amphetamines, phenmetrazine, caffeine and adrenaline. The trial court also opined that neither adrenaline nor caffeine were illegal, and concluded that therefore, the term excitative drugs was overbroad in that it encompassed those things which were both legal and illegal. On appeal, the court found that in order for appellant to maintain her challenge to the statute on the ground of overbreadth as applied to her case, she was required to establish that her own admitted conduct was wholly innocent and its proscription not supported by any rational relationship to a proper governmental objective. The court found that the trial court did not hold appellee to the proper standard for overbreadth challenge because phenmetrazine was a controlled substance under Florida law, Fla. Stat. ch. 893.03(2) (c)3 (1977), no question of the rationality of its regulation was before the court, and appellee did not contend that its introduction into a county jail was innocent conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the judgment granting appellee's motion to dismiss the charges against her and held that the trial court erred in holding the statute vague and in holding it overbroad, because no question of the rationality of the regulation of the controlled substance possessed by appellee was before the court and appellee did not contend that its introduction into a county jail was innocent conduct.</SPAN></P>

Cohorts testified that appellant shot each victim one time in the head. The police were notified that merchandise from a burglary of a market was at a residence.

Appellant was convicted of two counts of murder by a jury, but the trial court sentenced appellant to death even though the jury voted to impose a life sentence.

Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(b) (1975) and holding that a paternity action against appellee father was barred by the four-year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state, on behalf of true appellant mother, filed a paternity action against appellee father to determine paternity and support issues relative to the minor child. The child had been born over four years prior to the filing of the action and appellee argued that the statute of limitations in Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(b) (1975) barred the action. The trial court determined that appellee was the father but that the action was barred by statute. Appellant challenged the statute as unconstitutional because it violated the minor child's right to due process in that it treated her, as illegitimate, differently than it treated legitimately born children. The court agreed with appellant holding that the different classifications for legitimate and illegitimate children was violative of illegitimate children's due process rights. The court held that the statute did not bear a substantial relationship to the state's interest asserted as the basis for the statute and struck it as unconstitutional. The court therefore remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant condominium association challenged, on direct appeal and on petition for writ of certiorari, the decision of the Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida) holding that the restrictive covenant within the condominium agreement that barred residency by children under the age of 12 was unreasonable per se and therefore constitutionally prohibited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, brothers who owned a condominium together, had children under 12 and shared ownership of one of appellant's condominiums. The brothers alternated stays. The condominium agreement (agreement) provided for only single-family housing even though inter-family transfers were allowed. However, no children under 12 were supposed to be allowed residency in the condominium under the terms of the agreement. Appellant sued to set aside the transfer between appellee brothers and won at the trial level but appellees brothers won on appeal with the district court holding that the restriction against children under 12 was unconstitutional per se, unreasonable because of the arbitrary and selective enforcement, and the fact that the brothers shared the condo but not at the same time satisfied the single-family restriction. Appellants challenged but lost with the court holding that, even though the restriction was not per se unconstitutional, the fact that there were other children under 12 living in the condos made the enforcement against appellees arbitrary and unreasonable and therefore unconstitutional. The court therefore affirmed the district court's ruling for appellees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ruling that appellant's enforcement of the restrictive age covenant for the condominium association was unreasonable and unconstitutional was affirmed because the enforcement was selective and arbitrary and because the single-family restriction on the condo was not violated by the brothers' alternating use of the condominium.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In defendant's trial for felony murder, the trial court instructed the jury on felony murder without giving any instruction on the underlying felony of robbery. Respondent did not object, but the prosecutor informed the trial court of the error. The appellate court reversed holding that there was ample evidence that defendant had committed a homicide in the perpetration of the felony robbery. Plaintiff sought the court's review contending that the trial court did not commit reversible error in failing to define robbery under a felony murder instruction when defendant neither requested the instruction nor objected to the court's refusal to so instruct. The court held that only in the rare case of fundamental error was a defendant's right to appeal preserved without a contemporaneous objection. Here, because proof of the elements of robbery was necessary in order to convict defendant under the felony-murder theory, the trial court was obligated to give some instruction on those elements. Therefore, because there was a complete failure to give any instruction on those elements, such constituted a fundamental error, and the judgment of the appellate court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with failing to have the doors of his establishment open outward, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 823.06 (1977). Petitioner contended that the statutory classification of buildings used for public entertainment was invidiously discriminatory, thus violating the U.S. Const. amend. XIV equal protection clause. The court found that the classification scheme rested upon differences fairly and substantially related to the object of the legislation, because the statutory requirement was rationally related to the objective of public safety and the legislature had deemed application of this safety requirement to public entertainment facilities more important than to other types of establishments, due to the fact that the characteristics of public entertainment facilities in terms of crowd size and density were not identical to other types of facilities. The court rejected petitioner's argument that the statutory penalty of third-degree felony for this offense was cruel and unusual punishment, finding that the legislature had provided those sanctions it felt appropriate to ensure compliance in light of the tragic consequences that could arise.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order upholding the constitutionality of the statute and held that the classification scheme rested upon differences fairly and substantially related to the object of the legislation and that the statutory penalty of third-degree felony for the offense was not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 79-490, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted the Gasparilla Island Historic and Conservation District Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 79-490, which dealt with the creation of a historic and conservation district. A special government entity would be established after approval by a majority vote in a referendum. Appellee corporation owned real property within the proposed district and sought to enjoin the referendum. The trial court granted appellee summary judgment and held that that the Act was unconstitutional because of the method the act was to be submitted for voter approval. On appeal, the court affirmed the order finding the pre-enactment notice was legally inadequate because it was clearly inadequate to apprise interested persons of the scope and purpose of the proposed regulatory scheme. The court ruled that the provision allowed nonresident property owners to vote which violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. The court found the provision was not severable, and thus, the entire Act was void because the valid and void parts of the chapter were mutually connected with and dependent upon each other and severability was not compatible with the legislative intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled nolo contendere to second-degree murder for distributing heroin that proximately caused the death of another in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 782.04(2) (1973). On appeal, appellant argued that his due process rights were violated, challenged the applicability of first-degree felony murder, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 782.04(1)(a), with heroin distribution, and questioned his felony murder liability. The judgment was affirmed because the court found appellant's arguments had no merit. First, &sect; 782.04(1)(a) complied with due process and a conviction under &sect; 782.04(1)(a) was constitutional. Second, Adams and Dixon applied to all felonies under &sect; 782.04(1)(a) except heroin distribution because a heroin distributor was a principal and liable for first-degree murder. The court also ruled that because appellant pled nolo contendere to second-degree murder and admitted facts necessary to sustain a first-degree murder conviction, appellant was barred from questioning the sufficiency of the second-degree murder charge.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions for the crime of child abuse by contributing to the delinquency or dependency of certain minors. Defendants argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 827.04(3) was vague and overbroad. The second issue raised on appeal was that Fla. Stat. ch. 798.03 violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. Defendants were accused by indictments that linked together two penal statutes stating that they committed an act of attempted fornication and thereby committed the crime of child abuse. The court held that because the gender based classification created by the fornication statute did not bear a rational relationship to a permissible state objective, it clearly failed to meet the stricter standard of an important governmental interest. Therefore, Fla. Stat. Chap. 798.03 was void and the state could only proceed under the child abuse statute.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. Appellant argued that the testimony of the prosecution's witness was unreliable and that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial on this basis. The court held that the weight of the evidence was ordinarily a matter for the jury and their decision would not be overturned if it were supported by competent evidence. The court found that the record contained substantial evidence to support the jury verdict. Appellant contended that a new trial was warranted because of newly discovered evidence. The court disagreed and reasoned that the evidence was not newly discovered evidence, but a newly discovered witness. The court found that petitioner had information of a similar type available to him at the time of trial, but he elected not to present such evidence to the jury. Further, the court held that appellant failed to demonstrate how he was denied a fair trial by an impartial jury on the basis of the length of time the jury deliberated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state appealed from an order which held that its shrimping statute was unconstitutional. Defendant was a commercial fisherman and a Florida Marine Patrol officer cited defendant for possession of undersized shrimp. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss and declared Fla. Stat. Ch. 370.15 invalid insofar as it attempted to regulate shrimping outside of the territorial limits of Florida. The court held the statute unconstitutional to the extent that chapter 370.15 as it related to possession of small shrimp could affect interstate or foreign commerce. This result was purely incidental, indirect, and beyond the purpose of the legislation and did not invalidate the statute. The enactment of the law was within the legislature's prerogative in exercising the police power of the state to protect and regulate the production of shrimp in Florida. Therefore, the court reversed the trial court ruling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corporations challenged the application of Fla. Stat. ch. 562.131 (1977), the B-girl prohibition statute, on the ground that the prohibition of the solicitation of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages bore no reasonable relationship to the purpose of the statute. The circuit court held the statute was unconstitutional on its face and as applied to appellees. On appeal, the court held that state regulation of establishments licensed to sell alcoholic beverages could extend beyond regulation of alcohol sales. It then held it was rational and reasonable legislation because the legislature found it was in the public's interest to halt this solicitation activity. Finally, because statutory regulation did not have to be all-encompassing, appellees' equal protection rights were not violated because the legislation did not extend to those establishments which sold non-alcoholic beverages. The statutory means of regulation were rationally related to the statutory objective, and the members of the regulated class were treated equally. Thus, the judgment was reversed and the matter was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(a) (1975). He pleaded nolo contendere to the charge, and specifically reserved the right to appeal the denials of his motions to transfer and to dismiss. On appeal, the court held the statute did not prospectively delegate authority to the federal government by incorporating future federal statutory or administrative action classifying controlled substances. While methaqualone was not a controlled substance under federal law at the time the chapter went into effect, it was listed in the federal register as a substance that should be controlled. Thus, the classification preceded the legislative action and presumably was part of the impetus for controlling the drug. Finally, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 893.05(1) would not be part of the act unless it was intended that the statute penalize a doctor who gave a prescription in bad faith or outside of his professional practice. Thus, the legislature intended to penalize appellant's conduct. Finding the remaining contentions to be without merit, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decision below, in petitioners' favor, concluding the provision impermissibly impaired contract rights when it was not the least restrictive means possible to achieve the police power interest in requiring a unit owner's deposit to protect from lessors' foreclosure for non-payment of rent during litigation. The court noted no documentation of the underlying premise of massive condominium foreclosure threat was shown. The court explained it began its analysis of reasonableness of a contract impairment through application of two accepted principles: he who pays too late, pays less and virtually no degree of contract impairment was tolerable in Florida.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applied for admission to the practice of architecture in Florida pursuant to Fla. Stat. &sect; 467.11, which governed admissions without examination. Defendants initially rejected plaintiff's application on the ground that he did not possess the required degree. Plaintiff then petitioned for consideration of his application under the equivalency standard in Fla. Stat. &sect; 467.08(1)(b)(5). This application was also denied. Plaintiff then instituted a declaratory judgment action, seeking a judicial construction of the training equivalency standard of &sect; 467.08. Once again, plaintiff's application was denied. On appeal, the district court held that Fla. Stat. &sect; 467.08(1)(b)5 constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative authority contrary to Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The court held that when the legislature established the requirement that an applicant be a graduate of a school or college of architecture, it did so with reference to a definite conception of what a school or college of architecture was. Therefore, the court held that Fla. Stat. &sect; 467.08(1)(b)5 was not an unlawful delegation of legislative authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By direct appeal, plaintiff sought a reversal of the final order of the lower court, upholding the constitutionality of 1977 Fla. Laws ch. 77-557 and granting summary judgment in favor of defendants in a suit protesting annexation of certain land to defendants. Plaintiff asserted that although the majority of qualified electors in the area proposed to be annexed voted against annexation, the annexation was still approved because a majority of all of those voting in the referendum voted in favor of annexation. Plaintiff argued that chapter 77-557 violated the equal protection clause of the Florida and federal constitutions because it allowed the voting power of those residing in the area to be annexed and to be debased and diluted. The court rejected this argument and held that each affected qualified elector was afforded a right to vote, and in addition, those residing in the area to be annexed had the initial protection of a majority vote of the five county commission members of the council. Accordingly, chapter 77-557 was constitutional and the ordinance and referendum were valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed the ruling because there was no doubt regarding the legislature's power to annex territory to an existing municipality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A certain drug had been freely given to children and adults, members and nonmembers of a church. The trial court enjoined further use of the member's property as a church and enjoined the use of the drug on the member's property, but permitted the member to worship in her home with family and friends. The member filed a petition for writ of certiorari to review the trial court's issuance of the temporary injunction. The court affirmed the ruling of the trial court, finding that use of the drug created easy access for a child who had absolutely no interest in learning the religion, coupled with the indiscriminate use of the drug by members of the church, clearly warranted intervention by the state. The court found that the state's compelling interest outweighed the free exercise interests of the member. The court concurred with the trial court's finding that the residence was indeed serving as a center of operations for the church. The court found that the temporary injunction prohibiting the use of the property as a church was entirely reasonable and proper and was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought direct review from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Broward County (Florida), which held that the documentary stamp tax set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 201.02(2) (1977) was only to be applied prospectively and further holding that Fla. Stat. ch. 201.02(3) (1977) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees bought shares of a cooperative apartment, neither paying any documentary stamp tax nor recording their stock certificates. Subsequently, the legislature adopted Fla. Stat. ch. 201.02(2) (1977) and ch. 201.02(3) (1977), which required payment of documentary stamp taxes by cooperative apartment owners and recordation of stock certificates evidencing such ownership. Appellant state revenue agency construed the sections to have retroactive application and wrote appellees' cooperative apartment corporation, advising that all present and future members thereof were required to record their certificates and that taxes were due retroactively without limitation regarding date of acquisition of an apartment. Appellees brought a class-action lawsuit, and the trial court ruled in their favor, finding the statutes unconstitutional. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, rejecting appellant's contention that the statutes could be retroactively applied. However, the court found that it was error for the trial court to conclude that ch. 201.02(3) was unconstitutional as a violation of appellees' privacy rights because appellees were unaffected and had no standing to complain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state charged appellee criminal with armed trespass upon an island that was privately owned and completely surrounded by water, contrary to Fla. Stat. ch. 810.09(2)(c). Appellee claimed that he did not receive any actual communication against entering or remaining on the island and that the island was not posted, fenced, or under cultivation. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the charge on the ground that chapter 810.09(2)(c) and 810.011 were unconstitutional, which said motion was granted. Appellant sought review of the ruling. The court found that chapters 810.09(1) and 810.011(6) gave a sufficiently definite warning of the proscribed conduct and were not unconstitutionally vague or uncertain. The court found that an island, because of all its boundaries were formed by water, was fenced under chapter 810.011(6) for the purposes of charging trespass under chapter 810.09. The legislature was not required to expressly state that federal land included an island or land completely surrounded by water because such was a logical and reasonable conclusion of the language it used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants husband and wife sued appellee obstetrician alleging medical malpractice as the cause of their son's brain damage. Later, appellants added appellee anesthesiologist to the action by joinder. Between initial filing and joinder, the Medical Mediation Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 768.44 (Supp. 1978) came into effect. Appellants instituted medical mediation proceedings against appellee anesthesiologist, and a finding of no actionable negligence was entered. At trial, judgment was entered finding appellee obstetrician negligent and appellee anesthesiologist not negligent; motion for new trial was granted to appellee obstetrician, and motion for new trial against appellee anesthesiologist was summarily denied. Appellants sought review based on lower court's holding statute unconstitutional as applied to appellee obstetrician. Court held that new trial was required for both appellees on statutory grounds, since the statute was not applicable to any case in which formal suit was instituted before its enactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court reversed lower court's judgment, holding that new trial was required for both appellees, since the statute in question applied to neither of them where the action began prior to the act's enactment, and finding that denial of appellants' motion for new trial was therefore also improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant organization members challenged the order of the County Court for Leon County (Florida) that upheld the constitutionality of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant organization members entered a public health facility after visiting hours had ended and entered restricted areas for the purposes of conducting a consumer inspection of the maternity wards and nurseries. They were convicted of trespassing under Fla. Stat. ch. 810.08(1). Appellants challenged their convictions and the constitutionality of ch. 810.08(1). On appeal, the court affirmed and upheld the constitutionality of ch. 810.08(1). Chapter 810.08(1) was not overbroad or vague, for persons of ordinary intelligence were fully able to determine what conduct was proscribed by the statute. Certain areas of the public health facility could reasonably be restricted, that restriction did not infringe appellants' rights to free speech, and appellants' prosecution under ch. 810.08(1) by appellee state was not a selective enforcement of the law. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying one appellant's motion for severance because there was no evidence that she was prejudiced by not having her case severed. An extrajudicial identification of one of appellants was admissible because the identifying witness was present at trial and available for cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction of disorderly intoxication, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 856.011(1) (1975), contending that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to the facts of appellant's case because his words were protected speech under U.S. Const. amends. I, IV, and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. On appeal, the conviction was affirmed. In support of its ruling, the court noted that when questioned by a police officer regarding his activities, appellant threw an object at the officer's face, loudly and profanely abused the officer, and continued to curse and threaten the officer personally after he was seated in the police car. The court held that the constitutional protection afforded words failed when, by the manner of their use, words invaded the right of others to pursue their lawful activities. The court concluded that appellant's speech was not constitutionally protected as, from a subjective viewpoint of the police officer, appellant was intoxicated and created a public disturbance. The court also found that the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to support his conviction under Fla. Stat. ch. &sect; 871.01.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 812.14 (1977), which concerned trespass and larceny with relation to utility or cable television fixtures, unconstitutional on the ground that &sect; 812.14 created a presumption of intent and that &sect; 812.14 included a civil penalty as well as a criminal penalty and encompassed larceny as well as trespass, both contrary to Fla.

The trial court granted appellee's motion to dismiss and held that &sect; 812.14 was unconstitutional, finding that that the statute created a presumption of intent and that the statute included a civil remedy as well as a criminal penalty and encompassed larceny as well as trespass, both contrary to Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6, which limited laws to one subject and matter properly connected therewith. The state did not challenge that portion of the trial court order which found that the statute created a presumption of intent. Instead, the state challenged the remainder of the order, alleging that the proscription of both larceny and trespass by the statute was to assure adequate notice of the subject matter of the legislation and to avoid surprise and fraud upon the public. Multiple sanctions against prohibited conduct were not unique. Each provision was fairly and naturally germane to the subject expressed in the title and the several provisions were all necessary to achieve the purpose of the legislation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner appealed the decision from the Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida) that affirmed the condition of his probation that required him to consent to a search of his vehicles and premises at any time by any probation or law enforcement officer. The appellate court certified the question of whether such a condition violated petitioner's rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After petitioner was convicted of armed robbery, he was sentenced to life imprisonment with the provision that he would be placed on probation for life after 18 years. As a condition of his probation, the trial court required petitioner to consent to a warrantless search of his premises or vehicles by any probation or law enforcement officer at any time. The appellate court upheld the condition, but certified the question of whether the condition was unconstitutional. The court held that probation officers could search petitioner's premises and vehicles at any time because such searches were necessary in order to be able to supervise him properly. However, any evidence found pursuant to such a warrantless search could be used only in probation violation proceedings and not in any other type of a proceeding, because petitioner still retained some of his rights against unreasonable searches and seizures even as a probationer. Therefore, the condition requiring petitioner to give prior consent to all searches violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. IV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12, and the court quashed the decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the decision affirming a condition of petitioner's probation that required him to consent to a search of his vehicles and premises at any time by any probation or law enforcement officer, because the condition violated his federal and state constitutional rights against unreasonable searches, although a warrantless search by a probation officer to check only for probation violations was permitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision from the trial court (Florida), which denied appellant's motion to dismiss the information against him charging him with introduction or possession of a narcotic, hypnotic, or excitative drug--marijuana--into or upon the grounds of a county detention facility in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 951.22(1) (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with introduction or possession of a narcotic, hypnotic, or excitative drug-marijuana-into the grounds of a county detention facility in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. 951.22(1) (1975). Appellant filed a motion to dismiss contending &sect; 951.22(1) was invalid as the terms &quot;narcotic&quot;, &quot;hypnotic&quot;, and &quot;excitative&quot; were unconstitutionally vague. The trial court denied the motion, and appellant entered a plea of no contest to the charge. Appellant then sought the court's review of that denial contending that because marijuana did not fall within the categories of drugs described in &sect; 951.22(1), application of &sect; 951.22(1) to marijuana was unconstitutional. The court held that whether marijuana was a narcotic, hypnotic or excitative drug was a factual issue which appellant, by entering his plea of no contest, relieved plaintiff of its burden to prove. Further, questions of fact could not be reserved upon a plea of no contest. Additionally, although the constitutionality of &sect; 951.22(1) was a legal issue, and as such could be properly reserved, the terms at issue were sufficiently definite to satisfy constitutional standards. The trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Prisoner contended that when he was arrested for receiving and concealing stolen property, he was actually taken into custody for the murder, robbery, sexual battery and burglary. The court noted that it was not apparent from the record that the police possessed sufficient evidence to have arrested prisoner or to have sought a grand jury indictment for the offenses at the time he was arrested for receiving and concealing stolen property. The court held that the speedy trial time pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.191(a)(1) commenced with respect to the crimes committed when prisoner was formally arrested for these offenses. Prisoner also contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(1) (1975), which required a person convicted of a capital felony who was not sentenced to death, to have been sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole for 25 years, was unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of murder conviction and death sentence. The court rejected appellant's argument that the death penalty was unconstitutional. The court explained that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 921.141 (1975) was not per se unconstitutional. The court next rejected the argument that the judge below erred in declining to accede to a defense request to recall a witness for further cross-examination. The court noted that the proper predicate for impeachment of the witness could have been laid only by presenting her with the alleged inconsistent statement. The court indicated appellant's defense counsel failed to do this. The court further explained that appellant was not prejudiced because the witness admitted she had given different accounts at different times. The court found the judge erred in finding the existence of two aggravating circumstances for purposes of the death penalty. The court nevertheless concluded the remaining aggravating circumstances existed. The court explained that although there was error in assessment of some statutory factors, no mitigating factors were present to overcome presumptive appropriateness of the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant's motion to dismiss, upheld the constitutionality of the statute, both on its face and as applied, and granted appellee's petition to destroy the film. On appeal, the court found that no seizure was conducted as that term was used in ch. 847.011(7), and that the materials were therefore not properly brought before the trial court for an obscenity determination. Appellant voluntarily surrendered the film and subsequently demanded its return, thereby withdrawing his consent to appellee's possession of the tape. No warrant was ever issued and no judicial inquiry into probable obscenity was made prior to the petition for confiscation. Furthermore, ch. 847.011(7) did not support an action for destruction apart from a prior adjudication of criminal conduct under Fla. Stat. ch. 847.011(1)-(6). Thus, the order was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The court granted appellee's motion to dismiss. The reviewing court found that although Fla.

The court stated that modification of the agreement could not impair obligations because the possibility of modification was deemed to have been contemplated by the parties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of the first-degree murder of his daughter and, following a jury recommendation of a life sentence, the trial judge imposed the death penalty. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed, finding that a jury recommendation under the Florida trifurcated death penalty statute should be given great weight and in order to sustain a sentence of death following such a recommendation, the facts suggesting a sentence of death should be so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ. In review, the court found that two of the aggravating circumstances cited by the trial court did not exist but that the two remaining aggravating circumstances were justified. The court determined that the trial court was correct in concluding that no mitigating circumstances existed and because two validly found aggravating circumstances existed there was no automatic reversal of the death sentence required. The court found that after reviewing the record and the circumstances surrounding the murder, the facts supportive of the death sentence were so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the imposition of the death sentence by the trial judge following the jury's recommendation of a life sentence for appellant's conviction of the first-degree murder of his daughter. The court concluded that the facts suggesting the death sentence were so clear and convincing that no reasonable person could differ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employer sought review of an order reversing a summary judgment in its favor, which dismissed the third party complaint for indemnification filed by respondent manufacturer in an action resulting from the death of petitioner's employee from the use of respondent's product. The court reversed the decision denying the summary judgment, finding that summary judgment was properly granted to petitioner, and remanded the matter to the trial court for further action consistent with the opinion. The court determined that absent a special relationship between respondent and petitioner that would make respondent only vicariously, constructively, derivatively, or technically liable for the wrongful acts of petitioner, there was no right of indemnification on the part of respondent against petitioner. The court concluded that respondent's defense alleging negligence of petitioner as a contributing cause of the accident precluded an action for indemnity, because if both parties were at fault, no matter how slight the fault, then the principles of indemnity were inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision and found summary judgment was properly entered for petitioner employer. The court quashed the decision reversing that order and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee property owner's land was originally classified as agricultural for ad valorem tax purposes. After appellee filed subdivision plats on his land, appellant property appraiser relied on Fla. Stat. ch. 193.461(4)(a)4 to deny him an agricultural tax classification. The statute provided that the recording of a subdivision plat created an irrebuttable presumption that the land's use was nonagricultural. The Board of Tax Adjustment upheld the denial of an agricultural tax classification. Appellee filed four suits that were consolidated and that challenged the denial of an agricultural tax classification and attacked the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 193.461(4)(a)4. The trial court found the statute unconstitutional and entered summary judgment in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court first determined that the statute was not unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4(a) because it affected only the classification of land rather than its assessment. However, the court found that the statute violated both due process and equal protection rights and was, therefore, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Dade County (Florida) upholding the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 708.10 (1977), pursuant to the court's jurisdiction under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 3(b)(1), asserting that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated Fla. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife was treated at a hospital operated by appellee. Appellee brought an action against appellants husband and wife to collect unpaid hospital bills. In the complaint, appellee sought to recover against appellant husband based solely on his obligation to supply the necessities of his wife. Appellants asserted affirmative defenses and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment that the action against appellant husband was unconstitutional because Fla. Stat. ch. 708.10 violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, Fla. Const.&nbsp;art. X, &sect; 5, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, when interpreted in light of the common law duty of a husband to support his wife. Specifically, appellants asserted that the statute enabled a creditor of the wife to bring a direct action against her husband for necessities, while a wife had no corresponding legal responsibility to her husband or his creditors for the husband's necessities. The court rejected this argument and affirmed the trial court's judgment holding the statute constitutional, finding that it did not alter responsibilities at common law, but merely provided that it would not relieve a husband of any otherwise-existing duty to support his wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court order finding the statute constitutional, holding that it did not create any duty for a husband to support his wife, nor did it relieve a wife of any duty to support her husband, but merely stated that it should not be construed to relieve a husband of any duty of supporting his wife and children that he otherwise had.</SPAN></P>

The evidence in the case showed that the murder was committed by a single shot, fired when the hostage grabbed defendant's gun. Although the supreme court affirmed defendant's conviction, the court held that the trial court erred in finding that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs owned land adjacent to defendant city. After the passage of Fla.

The trial court granted defendant city's motion for summary judgment, and plaintiff landowners appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the notice was reasonably sufficient to notify plaintiffs that their property might be included in the proposed annexation. The notice indicated intent to annex adjacent property although it did not specify what property. However, since plaintiffs were adjoining landowners the court held that the notice was sufficient to put them on notice of the need to inquire further into the details. The notice was required to adequately inform plaintiffs of the subject of the proposed legislation but not the specific object of the legislation.</SPAN></P>

It thus reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also ordered the clerk to deposit the funds in an assignable interest bearing account. Receiver moved to obtain the interest earned on the money. The trial court granted receiver's motion and ruled that Fla. Stat. ch. 28.33 (1977) (chapter 28.33) was unconstitutional to the extent it applied to private monies.

The lower court entered judgment in appellees' favor. On appeal, the supreme court affirmed the judgment. The supreme court held that the Act was constitutional because it dealt with appropriations and that, when read in conjunction with section 236.081(3), it was neither vague nor indefinite. The supreme court held that by utilizing common sense and interpreting the plain meaning of the statutes, the administrators arrived at a formula which constituted the most reasonable interpretation of the provisions.

In affirming defendant's conviction, the supreme court rejected defendant's argument that Fla. Stat. ch. 782.071 was unconstitutionally vague and that the information failed to charge an offense. The supreme court held that section 782.071 was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave sufficient warning as to what was proscribed when measured by common understanding and practice. The supreme court held that the conduct prohibited by the statutory provision was reckless driving, likely to cause death or great bodily harm, which resulted in the killing of another human being. The supreme court further held that the proof required to prove vehicular homicide was not the same for manslaughter and that it was not unreasonable for the legislature to create a lesser-included offense to cover actions not covered by the manslaughter statute. Lastly, the supreme court held that the information was legally sufficient to inform defendant of the nature of the accusation against which he must defend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution challenged a decision of the County Court for Okeechobee County (Florida) that granted defendant's motion to dismiss the information charging him under Fla. Stat. ch. 365.16(1)(a) for making comments that are obscene, lewd, or indecent by means of telephone communication by concluding that the statute was overbroad and violated defendant's right to free speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 365.16(1)(a) for making obscene and indecent comments via telephone communication. He moved to dismiss the charges, arguing that the statute was overbroad and violated his right to free speech. The trial court granted his motion to dismiss, and the prosecution sought appellate review. In affirming, the state supreme court concluded that the statute was impermissibly overbroad in violation of defendant's freedom of speech as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. I and Fla. Const. amend. I. Just as the First Amendment's free speech guarantee protected an individual's right to possess obscene material within his own home, this freedom prohibited the state from punishing defendant for the mere use of obscene language in a telephone communication. Because the scope of Fla. Stat. ch. 365.16(1)(a) was not limited to cases where the listener did not consent to use of the proscribed language, that is, because the statute did not contain the essential qualifying element of an unwilling listener, the statute was impermissibly broad and, therefore, violated defendant's free speech protections.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought dismissal of the information against her as being vague and unconstitutional. The circuit court denied her motion to dismiss. On appeal, appellant challenged the dismissal on the basis that the circuit court erred in upholding the constitutionality of Fla. Stat.

The court also held that a statute need not index all of its contents, but merely be worded so as not to mislead a person of average intelligence as to the scope of the enactment and put a person on notice to inquire into the body of the statute further. Finally, the court noted that the term &quot;endeavors&quot; as used in the information meant that appellant had done some overt act and the term sufficiently stated that she attempted the crime with which she was charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, booksellers in two consolidated cases, sought review of the orders from the Circuit Court for Broward County, (Florida) that, in addition to enjoining the sale of eight magazines found to be obscene, permanently enjoined the future sale of any materials that violated the provisions of Fla. Stat. 847.011(1)(a) (1977) by depicting 11 specific acts or poses. Appellants alleged that the injunction violated U.S. Const. amend. I.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

Each trial court found the magazines to be obscene in violation of &sect; 847.011(1)(a) (1977), permanently enjoined their sale, and permanently enjoined appellants from selling any other materials in the future if the materials violated &sect; 847.011(1)(a) (1977) by portraying 11 specific acts or poses. On consolidated appeal, the court held that the U.S. Const. amend. I did not protect obscene material and that &sect; 847.011(1)(a) was facially constitutional. However, because the portrayal of sexual conduct, in and of itself, was not obscene, and because a work had to be examined in its totality to determine if it were obscene, and because the burden of self-censorship could not be placed on appellants, the trial courts could not permanently enjoin the sale of items that had not been judicially and specifically determined to be obscene. Therefore, except with respect to the eight magazines, the trial court reversed the orders, dissolved the injunctions, and remanded the cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a deputy sheriff, sought review of the judgment from the Circuit Court of Brevard County (Florida) that found that Fla. Laws ch. 67-1149 was unconstitutional and that appellant was not a public employee as defined by Fla. Stat. ch. 447 (1976),denied his request for an injunction instructing appellee, the sheriff, to reinstate him as a civil service employee, and dismissed his prayer for relief under ch. 447.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a newly elected sheriff, dismissed appellant, a deputy sheriff, because appellee was reorganizing the department. Appellant sued to be reinstated as a civil service employee under Fla. Laws ch. 67-1149 (Act) or a public employee under Fla. Stat. ch. 447 (1977). The trial court found that the Act violated the Florida constitution, and dismissed the claim under Fla. Stat. ch. 447 (1977). On appeal, the court held that a deputy sheriff was not a public employee under Fla. Stat. ch. 447 (1977). However, although the Act was a special act that created a civil service act for appellant's county, because Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 11(a), which prohibited special acts from restricting the duties of officers, had to be read in pari materia with Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 14 which permitted civil service laws to be enacted for local governments, the act was not unconstitutional. The failure of the title to the Act to refer expressly to deputy sheriffs, referring only to employees, did not mislead the public because deputy sheriffs were employees of the office of the sheriff. Thus the title was not unconstitutionally defective. Thus, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment finding that the civil service act for the county was unconstitutional and remanded the case for further proceedings, because although appellant, a deputy sheriff was not a public employee, the state constitution permitted special civil service acts for specific counties, deputy sheriffs were defined as civil servants under the act, and the title of the act did not need to refer to deputy sheriffs.</SPAN></P>

However, the court also held that the complete abolition of write-in candidacies by the Florida Election Code was unconstitutional and that 1995 Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants charged appellees with solicitation, offer, or receipt of a bribe in connection with furnishing of services to a nursing home patient under Fla. Stat. ch. 400.172(2)(a) (1977). Appellees filed a writ of habeas corpus with the trial court and argued the unconstitutionally vague and overbroad statute deprived them of their constitutional rights. The trial court found the statute did not furnish sufficient notice to potential violators and that its vagueness and overbreadth criminalized innocent conduct. Appellants challenged this ruling and again on appeal contested appellees' standing to proceed. The court ruled appellees' had standing because of their personal stakes in prosecution. The court found the trial court review exceeded its proper scope and ruled that ch. 400.172(2)(a) was not vague and ch. 400.172(1)(b) was properly narrow. While the court acknowledged there could be situations where the statute gave minimal guidance for prosecutorial discretion, those situations did not render the statute unconstitutional. The court quashed the trial court order and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

III, &sect; 10, for failure to publish a notice of intention to seek enactment and failure to condition the law on a referendum and directed that the petitioner refrain from issuing a formal writ.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought consolidated review of three orders from the County Court, Pinellas County, Florida, which granted defendants' motions to dismiss based upon a finding that the criminal contributing to the delinquency of a minor statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 827.04(3) (1977) was invalid because it was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state charged defendants, in three separate actions, with contributing to the delinquency of a minor in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 827.04(3) (1977). Defendants filed motions to dismiss based upon their contention that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The lower court granted the motions and dismissed the actions against defendants. On consolidated appeal to the state supreme court, the orders of dismissal were reversed and the cases remanded for further proceedings. The court held that because the current statute was the substantially the same as its predecessor, and because the predecessor withstood an attack for vagueness, the current statute was also constitutional. The court held that it was implicit in caselaw precedent that the acts proscribed by the law must be performed under such circumstances that a person of common understanding would know that they caused or tended to cause or encouraged or contributed to the delinquency or dependency of a person under the age of 18 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders that dismissed the charges against defendants under the contributing to the delinquency of a minor statute. The court remanded the cases to the lower court for further proceedings. The court held that based upon precedent, the statute was constitutional as construed.</SPAN></P>
