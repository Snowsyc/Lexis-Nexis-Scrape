</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant had previously appealed his conviction on the grounds that a detective's testimony was insufficient to establish probable cause in support of a search warrant, and that the events upon which the finding of probable cause was based occurred long before the issuance of the warrant. Defendant contended that those events had no probative value on the question of the existence of drugs in his residence. The court had previously rejected those arguments and rejected them again. The court found that defendant failed to object to the seizure of the drugs and found that the detective was an experienced narcotics officer who conducted the search on the basis of reliable information. The court held that the seizure of the drugs was pursuant to a warrant that had been previously held to have been constitutional. The court held that defendant was not entitled under Wis. Stat. &sect; 963.03(1) (1967) to a hearing within 48 hours of the issuance of the search warrant on the question of whether the substance seized was heroin because the statute made no provision for such a hearing. The court held the because of defendant's prior conviction, he was not entitled to probation under &sect; 161.02(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which found him guilty of disorderly conduct under Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.01(1) for his yelling at a police officer and grabbing a police officer and interfering with a lawful arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was protesting outside a store, and the officer and his partner were attempting to arrest a girl for shoplifting. Defendant yelled at the officer in an attempt to get his badge number and thereafter began shoving his way between the officer and his partner. He was arrested for disorderly conduct, and was convicted by the trial court. He challenged the decision, and the court affirmed. The complaint was sufficient to inform defendant of the nature of the conduct because it had defendant's name, date of the incident, the charge involved, the statute violated, the location of the incident, and who was making the charge. The trial court erred in convicting defendant for disorderly conduct for his speech. However, his actions in interfering with the arrest constituted disorderly conduct and were sufficient to support the conviction. The trial court did not err in limiting defendant's cross-examination of the officer because the restricted questions were neither relevant nor material. Additionally, defense counsel failed make an offer of proof to show the materiality of the questions excluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a city and various corporate municipalities, sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which entered judgment in favor of respondents area board of vocational, technical and adult education. The city contended, inter alia, that the power to levy taxes given the district boards in Wis. Stat. &sect; 38.155(6) was a violation of Wis. Const. rt. IV, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The board contended that the corporate municipal appellants had no standing to bring the present action since they were not the real parties in interest. The court agreed and held that city had no standing to commence the action. The case involved a municipality that was suing the state superintendent of public instruction, however, the constitutional question affected the rights of the individual appellants, and the question was properly before the court. The major challenge to Wis. Stat. &sect; 38.155 was that the power to levy taxes that was given to the district boards in &sect; 38.155(6) was unconstitutional because the taxing power belonged exclusively to the legislature. The court disagreed and affirmed the order in favor of the board and against the city. The city claimed that vocational education was peculiarly a state function under Wis. Const. art. X, &sect; 6, and that to finance it through area boards violated Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court disagreed that the provision made vocational education exclusively a state function could only be supported only on a statewide basis, rather than on an area basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order in favor of the board and against the city, that the given statute that provided for vocational education on an area basis did not violate the state's constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant power boater challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Sheboygan County (Wisconsin), which held in his action for a declaration that a local ordinance was invalid that regulating the lake that was within the village's boundaries was within the power that respondent state granted to it pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.77(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court held that, so long as it promoted the public health and safety, the village's ordinance that restricted the use of powerboats on the lake did not violate &sect; 30.77(3). The court affirmed that ruling on appeal. The court reasoned that &sect; 30.77(3) only restricted the village's right to regulate the use and the operation of boats to ordinances that were local regulations that were not contrary to or inconsistent with Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 30.60 - 30.71 and that were in the interest of public health or safety. The court also held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.77's legislative history showed that that statute gave the local authorities a considerable amount of power to enact local boating regulations that supplemented the state law. The court further found that Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.77(3) did not conflict with the trust doctrine, noting that Wis. Stat. &sect; 30.77 was designed to further the trust by allowing a limited regulation of competing water uses in the interest of public health and safety if the local prevailing conditions necessitated such regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed a ruling in the boater's action that challenged the village's local ordinance that restricted the use of powerboats on the lake that held that that form of regulation did not violate the power that the state had delegated to the village.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was in an automobile accident with insured. Appellant sued respondent for damages arising from the accident under insured's automobile insurance policy. After the trial court granted respondent's motion to dismiss, appellant sought review. On appeal, the court stated that the trial court made a very explicit finding of fact when it stated that it did not believe that appellant gave an oral notice to respondent. The court affirmed in favor of appellee because appellant had not met her burden of proof to show that respondent was not prejudiced by the failure to receive notice for a period of almost 15 months after the accident. The court stated that the provisions of the insurance contract were not complied with, and the trial court properly dismissed the complaint. The court did not reach the issue of constitutionality because it found no compelling reason to depart from the rule that it would not consider constitutionality when raised for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought relief from an entry of judgment by the Circuit Court, Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) convicting defendant on a charge of vagrancy and loitering, under Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.02(2), by challenging the constitutionality of the statute as well as the sufficiency of the evidence presented to convict him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought relief from the trial court's decision. The court reversed and remanded. It found Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.02(2) both unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. A statute was too vague when it failed to give fair notice of what it prohibited. It was overbroad when its language, given its normal meaning, was so broad that its sanctions could apply to conduct that the state was not entitled to regulate. The statute failed to meet the specificity requirements as to scope, place, or purpose. Therefore, the use of the term &quot;loitering&quot; rendered the statute vague as it failed to provide fair notice of the proscribed conduct, classified innocent conduct as criminal, and was susceptible to arbitrary law enforcement. Also, the statute failed to define with precision the distinction between criminal and non-criminal conduct and could be used to criminalize conduct that was beyond the legitimate reach of the state's police power. Since the court found that the invalidity of the statute required reversal of the trial court's decision and a dismissal of the prosecution's complaint against the defendant, the court declined to consider the sufficiency issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two days after the delinquency adjudication, without hearing or reason given for the transfer, defendant was transferred to the women's prison. Defendant argued that there was no statutory authority for placement of a girl found delinquent in juvenile court proceedings in the state prison for women. The statute primarily involved was Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.52. In reversing, the court held that there was no statutory authority for defendant's transfer to the women's prison. Under the court's construction of &sect; 48.52, the statute took away the right of the Department to send children adjudged delinquent to state penal institutions, rather than to find an intent or result that such right was to be expanded to include nondelinquent children placed in custody of the Department.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners sought a writ of habeas corpus challenging the procedures used by the Department of Health and Social Services in the revocation of probation and parole. Specifically, petitioners sought to establish their rights to a hearing and to assistance of counsel in revocation of probation and parole proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners asserted that they were denied due process because they were not afforded a hearing or the right to counsel in the revocation of their probation or parole. They further asserted that they were denied equal protection of the law because Wis. Stat. &sect; 973.11(5) provided that only counties with populations of more than 500,000 were required to afford a hearing in probation revocation proceedings. The court held that due process and basic fairness required the Department to afford a limited hearing in revocation of parole and probation proceedings. The court reasoned that parole and probation constituted conditional liberties that could not be revoked without a hearing. However, the court concluded that the difference in procedure established by &sect; 973.11(5) did not violate equal protection. Moreover, petitioners were not entitled to counsel at revocation hearings. Although the court's decision was prospective only, the court held that the revocations in cases on file in the state courts had to be declared nullities. In such cases, the court directed the Department to expunge the revocations from the record.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that petitioners were entitled to a limited hearing in revocation of parole and probation proceedings, without the right to counsel, and that such a hearing was by certiorari directed to the court of conviction. The court further held that the right was prospective only, except as to those petitions on file as of the date of the decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment entered by the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which convicted him of commercial gambling, a violation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 945.03(2) (1967). The trial court had denied defendant's motions to dismiss the indictment against him on the ground that &sect; 945.03(2) was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant worked as a bartender. He placed a bet on a football game for a regular customer. He also placed bets on two baseball games for the customer. Defendant refused to place a fourth bet on a sporting event for the customer. Defendant was arrested and charged with commercial gambling. The trial court denied his motions to dismiss the charge on the ground that &sect; 943.03(2) was unconstitutional for vagueness. A jury returned a guilty verdict. The trial court entered a judgment on the verdict. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Section 945.03(2) included those who intentionally received, recorded, or forwarded bets within its definition of commercial gambling. The court noted that &sect; 945.03(2) distinguished between making a bet, activity covered by Wis. Stat. &sect; 945.02(1), and receiving bets or offers to bet. That distinction between making a bet and receiving bets clearly separated casual bettors from bookmakers and their agents. Moreover, Wisconsin law made all gambling activity illegal, without regard to whether it was covered by Wis. Stat. &sect; 945.02(3) (1967). Therefore, the court rejected defendant's vagueness argument.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wis. Stat. &sect; 49.01(7) conditioned eligibility for categorical aid programs on residency within the state for one year. It also provided for a eligible recipient's removal from the state. Section 49.01(7) allowed temporary assistance, not to exceed 30 days, for persons not meeting those requirements. Wis. Stat. &sect; 49.04 required the state to reimburse counties for temporary assistance. The United States Supreme Court struck down durational residency requirements as unconstitutional. The Secretary refused to process reimbursement claims on the ground that the striking of residency requirements had abrogated the need for temporary assistance. The county filed suit for a writ of mandamus compelling him to do so. The court granted the writ. It found that temporary assistance of 30 days was wholly compatible with the 15- to 30-day processing period for the various categorical aid programs. Moreover, the Wisconsin Legislature did not alter &sect; 49.04 and Wis. Stat. &sect; 49.01(7) when it addressed the Supreme Court's decision. Therefore, the court severed the residency and removal provisions from &sect; 49.01(7) so as to permit the continued filing of claims for temporary assistance.</SPAN></P>

He also challenged the denial of his change of venue motion and the admission of certain evidence. The court affirmed, reiterating the position that, because defendant entered a plea of innocence by insanity and elected a bifurcated trial under Wis. Stat. &sect; 957.11 (1967), evidence of his mental state was only admissible during the sanity portion of his trial. That was particularly true in defendant's case where his defense in the guilt stage was that he did not commit the killings at all. The court further held that: (1) it was not a violation of due process to shift the burden of establishing insanity to defendant; (2) the jury was entitled to believe those experts who testified that defendant did not meet the test for insanity; (3) defendant waived his objection to a question asked of the experts by failing to object the first time it was asked; (4) the denial of a change of venue was not improper; and (5) evidence from a warrantless search was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After evidence was presented to a jury, defendants knowingly and voluntarily waived a jury trial. The trial court then made findings of guilt. On appeal, defendants argued in part that their waiver was invalid because the jury had heard part of the case and the trial court had heard the remainder. The court disagreed. The waiver was retroactive to the beginning of the trial, so the trial court heard the entire case, including all the evidence. The court rejected the argument that Wis. Stat. &sect; 957.01(1) (replaced by Wis. Stat. &sect; 972.02) required a waiver to take place prior to the commencement of a jury trial. Defendants also appealed on the ground of various illegal searches and seizures. The court held that a police officer's use of a flashlight to look inside of a car on a public street was a &quot;plain sight&quot; search. Once the officer saw a shiny object under a front car seat, the object was in &quot;plain sight,&quot; and he could take it even if he had not yet determined it to be a gun. After discovering the gun, a warrantless pat-down of defendants was authorized. Warrantless custodial inventory searches of defendants and the car at the police station did not violate the 4th Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the Wisconsin Watchmaking Examining Board, sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which ruled that the provisions of Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board had apparently applied ch. 125 against respondent individual in some manner. The court reversed, declaring ch. 125 to be constitutional. Ch. 125 was a valid exercise of Wisconsin's police power and was an apparent attempt to protect consumers from fraud and incompetence in the field of watchmaking and watch repair. The fact that in Wis. Stat. &sect; 125.05 the legislature had delegated the duty of making rules and regulations for conducting examinations of watchmaking applicants to the Board did not make Wis. Stat. ch. 125&nbsp;unconstitutional. The legislature had the power to delegate the task of developing rules that would carry out the legislative intent of ch. 125 to the Board where there were procedural safeguards to insure that the Board acted within the legislative purpose of ch. 125.

The officer himself had seen a masked man appear in a doorway at the neighbor's house, then leap back inside and slam the door. One defendant had been seen fleeing from the house. A man had been seen by another observer a short distance away; he was out of breath from running and was armed with a dangerous weapon. The second defendant was seen leaping back into the garage. The reports culminated in defendants' convictions. The court held that there was probable cause to arrest both defendants. The joint trial was not prejudicial to defendants; full instructions were given to the jury. The evidence clearly disclosed joint participation and advance planning; circumstantial evidence connecting defendants as co-workers in crime was overwhelming. Because defendants were unable to consummate the crime of robbery by actually taking anything, they could not be charged with robbery; they could, however, be charged with attempted robbery. Defendants received a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

The court held that in determining ownership for purposes of taxation, the court was to apply the true or beneficial ownership test. The court held that the legal title to the property was in the United States, and all items were either furnished by the government or purchased at its expense. The companies were not able to use the property, without permission, for nongovernmental purposes. The court held that the subject statutes, as written, were not use taxes; therefore, they could not provide a basis for taxation on that ground, as had been established in other states.

The court rejected his argument and upheld the constitutionality of the statute, finding it to be a proper legislative response to the mandate to maintain public order and protect personal freedoms. The statute did not proscribe activities intertwined with protected freedoms unless carried out in a manner which was violent, abusive, indecent, profane, boisterous or unreasonably loud, and under circumstances in which such conduct tended to cause or provoke a disturbance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The purchaser contended that the broker racially discriminated against him in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1982 by refusing to show him a listed house, which was owned by a white person. The record established that the broker and the homeowner entered into an agency agreement with an oral agreement that the broker would not show the property to African Americans. The purchaser contended that the broker's violation of &sect; 1982 constituted incompetency, improper dealing, or untrustworthiness within the meaning, intent, and purpose of Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 136.08 (2) (i) or (k), so as to authorize the Board to suspend or revoke the broker's license. The dismissal of the purchaser's complaint was affirmed. The court held that the Board was without authority to revoke or suspend a real estate broker's license because of racial discrimination and that it properly dismissed the purchaser's complaint. The court found that although &sect; 1982 prohibited private discrimination as well as public, and that it formed the basis for a private tort action against an offending real estate broker, it did not confer jurisdiction upon the Board to revoke or suspend a license for its violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of theft and was sentenced as a repeat offender. He appealed and argued that the indeterminate sentence imposed on him constituted cruel and unusual punishment because the offense at issue only involved the theft of two boxes of candy. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing the maximum sentence under the repeater statute because defendant's sentence was not imposed solely because of the candy theft, but also because of his prior criminal conduct. Defendant also argued that the use of the presentence report by the trial court deprived him of his rights to due process and to be confronted by the witnesses against him. The court noted that defendant's sole objection was that the report was inadequate because it did not include a psychiatric evaluation. The court found that defense counsel was aware that the psychiatric evaluation would not be included in the report prior to the sentencing hearing and held that defendant was not denied due process of law either because the presentence report did not include a psychiatric evaluation or because the trial judge refused to order one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company recorded the mortgage assigned to it by the landowner. The landowner entered into a land contract with the couple. In 1967, the company instituted a foreclosure action on the land and filed a lis pendens. Two weeks later, the couple recorded their land contract. The couple claimed not to learn of the foreclosure action until 1969. The company did not adequately verify the couple's interest in the land, as the couple was in possession of the land throughout the relevant period. However, the couple did nothing to intervene in the lawsuit until a year and a half after the lis pendens was filed, despite recording their land contract after the lis pendens. Thus, the court concluded that neither party recognized the purpose of the lis pendens statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 281.03(1), and that the statute did not govern. Instead, the court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the couple's motion to intervene in the company's foreclosure action because the company was unaware of the couple, but the couple was aware, or should have been aware, of the company's interest and waited many months to act.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the proposed annexation, finding no facts evincing a need for the city to acquire the lands and that the boundaries of the proposed annexation were fixed arbitrarily and capriciously solely to assure its success. In affirming, the court held that the rule of reason was applicable to annexation proceedings under &sect; 66.024 and required the city to demonstrate a present or future need for the lands. The evidence supported the trial court's finding that the proposed annexation area was not presently in need of city sanitary sewer services and that the installation of such services either currently or in the foreseeable future would not be economically feasible. Thus, the city failed to prove a current or reasonably foreseeable future need for the lands proposed for annexation as required under &sect; 66.024 because it failed to show any need for the proposed annexation in order to provide the lands with sewer facilities. The court concluded that the towns were not entitled to attorney's fees as part of the award of disbursements because attorney's fees were not recoverable under &sect; 66.024(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which denied the city's application for annexation. The court reversed the award of disbursements to the towns, including attorney's fees, and remanded for further proceedings to determine the proper amount of actual disbursements to be awarded to the towns, excluding attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 161.275 was raised for the first time on appeal. One of defendant's central arguments was the unreasonableness of classifying marijuana as a narcotic drug. Thus, defendant raised a constitutional question for the first time on appeal, which required the resolution of a factual issue. The court found no reason why it should deviate from the general rule and allow defendant to question the constitutionality of &sect; 161.275 when he had previously failed to raise that issue. Defendant also argued that his entry of the guilty plea was the result of duress, and stated that the failure to be advised of the possible constitutional defenses combined with the possible maximum penalty constituted undue duress and psychological pressure. The court found that defendant's argument was inconsistent in that he first conceded the guilty plea was entered free of duress and then argued that the plea was the subject of duress. With respect to the psychological pressure of a possible 10-year sentence, the court concluded that this was the type of pressure (maximum sentence possible) which played a role in every plea agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court had previously held that a statutory procedure (Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 66.20 - 66.209) for creation of metropolitan sewerage districts, insofar as it required the county court's policy determination that the goals of the statutes would be &quot;best served by the creation of a district,&quot; constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the judiciary. In response to that decision, the legislature adopted a new law which purported to validate as lawfully organized districts all metropolitan sewerage districts which had been organized under the prior act. The court held that the validating act, which created Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.20(3), was a valid enactment and not a special or private law contravening Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 31. The act was a curative act, which was required to be liberally construed as affecting important public interests. The act was general, not special, because it applied to all metropolitan sewerage districts which had attempted to organize under Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 66.20 to 66.209, as a class. Because the district had adopted a resolution recognizing and assuming all its prior obligations, it became a valid viable district capable of continuing its operations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested and charged after taking a check that had been filled out by someone else and then cashing it. The court rejected defendant's contention that he was entitled to a free transcript after a preliminary hearing. Defendant was entitled to access to a transcript and that access was provided when the clerk of court allowed the transcript to be borrowed up until the time of trial. Defendant was not entitled to the same instrumentality as a rich man in forging his appeal. Although a police officer misstated the precise words required in the Miranda warnings, the warning as given was sufficient as a whole to apprise defendant of his constitutional rights. The trial court did not err in concluding that defendant's confession was voluntary, and that defendant was sufficiently intelligent to be aware of his rights as they were read to him. The trial court did not err in admitting a statement made by defendant to the owner of a service station simply because defendant was presented to the service station owner shortly after his arrest. The confrontation did not cause the admission. Defendant failed to properly preserve his insufficiency of the evidence argument.</SPAN></P>

The County Court of St. Croix County (Wisconsin) awarded the wife temporary custody of the minor children, temporary support, occupancy of the Wisconsin residence, and temporary use of the automobiles in her possession.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court based its rulings on the parties' conflicting affidavits. The affidavits were in conflict as to whether the wife had continued to reside in Wisconsin after the husband left Wisconsin. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to find that the wife met the 30-day residency requirement to commence the action and that the trial court had jurisdiction over the action for legal separation and temporary custody of the minor children. The court held that the husband had sufficient &quot;minimum contacts&quot; within Wisconsin pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 247.057 and 262.05(11) for personam jurisdiction to attach and that the husband was properly personally served with notice of the proceedings.

The court held that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court's denial of the husband's motion to quash the temporary support orders and the order for payment of the parties' residential mortgages.

Defendant claimed the trial court erred in denying his motion for dismissal on the grounds of an illegal lineup. Ten months after sentencing, the trial court reduced defendant's maximum sentence from 10 years to 8 years. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction and reduction of the sentence. The court held that defendant voluntarily and understandingly waived counsel at the time of the lineup. The court ruled that a violation of due process in the lineup, if there was any, was not only harmless but harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the error at the preliminary examination to restrict the cross-examination of the State witnesses who identified defendant in the police lineup was not prejudicial because the lineup was fair. The court ruled that the trial court had the power to modify the sentence even though the service of the sentence had commenced.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An heir made application to a veteran's home at the time of the decedent's death according to the provisions of Wis.

Stat. &sect; 45.365 (1965), which defined income to include an inheritance as a part of the formula for member income payments, was applicable. It ruled that the heir was barred from renouncing the intestate inheritance. On appeal, the judgment was reversed. The court held that the contractual rights and obligations of the heir were determined by the statutory provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 45.37(9) (1963), which she agreed to abide at the time of her application. At that time, a contract was created between the heir and the home. The court ruled that there was nothing in the statutory language that gave a legislative intent to include an inheritance within the meaning of &quot;income&quot; under &sect; 45.37(9). The court concluded that the heir had not contractually disabled herself from renouncing the inheritance. Therefore, the inheritance from the decedent was not income under &sect; 45.37(9) and the heir was not foreclosed from her option to renounce the inheritance.</SPAN></P>

He appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), contending that he was denied a fair trial on the first burglary conviction because the trial court erroneously granted the State's motion to grant immunity to a State witness under Wis. Stat. &sect; 885.34 and that his first conviction was improperly considered in sentencing him on the second conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the granting of immunity was unconstitutional, that granting immunity and ordering a reluctant witness to testify was improper, and that &sect; 885.34 improperly was used to change the witness's testimony. The court held that &sect; 885.34 and the procedure used by the State was constitutional. If a witness asserted his rights against self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend. V or Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, then he could be granted immunity and ordered to answer. The trial court was not required to go further after it found that the witness might subject himself to a charge of theft or drunkenness and determine whether there were other reasons why he was reluctant to testify. Immunity was not granted so that the witness could change his testimony. Though the State moved to grant immunity following the witness's express statement that he was claiming his privilege against self-incrimination, the trial court deferred granting immunity and ordering the witness to testify until it found that he was entitled to invoke the Fifth Amendment. The trial court properly considered defendant's first conviction in choosing between sentencing alternatives in the second case.</SPAN></P>

The city failed to show that another hearing would have been unfair, and the court concluded that any expense or inconvenience incurred by the city from a further hearing was justified by changes in factors such as population, water consumption, and sewage volume. The Department had previously stated that the prior hearing was for informational purposes only and that additional hearings might be required; thus, it did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner in denying the city's request for a declaratory ruling that it had no authority to conduct further hearings.

Their prayer for relief asked the court to determine &quot;under what&quot; circumstance plaintiffs had a duty of obeying the police orders. The court had not been given a set of facts, even of a hypothetical nature, to use as a basis for resolving the legal question. Plaintiffs asked the court to pose its own hypothesis. The court doubted that its speculation in regard to what law might have been used by police authorities to implement their orders or the court's fancy in regard to fact situations with innumerable variations would be at all helpful to plaintiffs or definitively to determine their rights in a multitude of different fact situations that might have arisen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant tenant allegedly complained to health authorities of housing code sanitary violation. Plaintiff landlord sued defendant tenant for eviction. Defendant tenant contended that he had federal constitutional right to make such complaints and public policy as derived from housing laws, health laws, and local ordinances would be frustrated if he were not permitted to assert this defense. The lower court held for plaintiff landlord. On appeal, the court reversed and ordered a new trial. As a matter of statutory construction and for reasons of public policy, such an eviction could not be permitted. To permit retaliatory evictions would clearly frustrate the effectiveness of the housing code as a means of upgrading the quality of housing.

Second, the court held that dismissal of the garnishment complaints was warranted.

When the trial court upheld the ordinance's constitutionality, review was sought. Upon review, the retired employee claimed the board lacked standing to argue that the ordinance violated &sect; 26 and that it illegally authorized public funds for a private purpose. Initially, the court rejected the contention that the board could not question the ordinance's constitutionality because: (1) whether public funds were being diverted for a private purpose was of great public concern; and (2) the issues raised by the board would not be raised by individual taxpayers. After finding the board had standing, the court held &sect; 26 was inapplicable because the increased pensions were to be paid out of county funds and not the state general fund. The court also held there had not been an expenditure of public funds for a private purpose because the expenditures were for a public purpose.

The State claimed on appeal that &sect;&sect; 245.10 and 245.30(1)(f) were legitimate exercises of legislative power. The court agreed with the State's claim. The court ruled that &sect;&sect; 245.10 and 245.20(1)(f) were valid legislative acts because they punished only the conduct of Wisconsin residents, they protected a legitimate and substantial protectible interest of Wisconsin both as to the protection the welfare of its minors and the marriage relationship of its residents, they did not call for enforcement or impose duties upon any foreign state, they required enforcement by the courts of Wisconsin, and they were not repugnant to the laws of another state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin) rejected plaintiff's argument that Madison, Wis., Ordinance 12.141(6), setting the fines, violated Wis. Stat. &sect; 349.06, requiring that city ordinances be in strict conformity with the statutes. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The violation was plaintiff's first parking offense. The fine assessed was greater than provided in Wis. Stat. &sect; 346.55(1) for a first offense. The court ruled that the city had no authority to set the fine higher than provided in the statute. The court added that the particular maximum forfeiture was not the prime inducement which led the city officials to pass this ordinance. The court could not have held that the maximum was deemed so important by the common council that it would not have passed the ordinance if this penalty had not been included. The court added that even if it concluded that the strict conformity rule in Wis. Stat. &sect; 349.06 did not apply to the forfeiture provisions of an ordinance, it would have been forced to find as a matter of law that the excess of the forfeiture over the statutory maximum was invalid because the amount of the forfeiture was excessive and unreasonable in view of the nature and the object of the ordinance. Rejecting plaintiff's further argument, the court said that when metered public parking was available, no places had to be reserved for the public in the garage.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the order of the trial court affirming the assessment of a forfeiture for parking in a space reserved for county employees to provide for a forfeiture of the maximum set by the statute and, as modified, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A protester led a protest in the Assembly chamber, taking it over for about 12 hours. The Assembly found the protester in contempt and sentenced him to prison for the length of the regular session of the Legislature or six months, whichever was shorter. The protester sought habeas corpus relief, which was denied. The court held that the Assembly had the power of legislative contempt under Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8 and Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13.26 and 13.27 to maintain order in its house. Legislative contempt was different from direct judicial contempt in that was not to punish for a past deed but to prevent threatened conduct which would interfere with the proper function of the Assembly. There was no need for a hearing because it was obvious what the protester did. The protester in fact did not avail himself of the opportunity under Wis. Stat. &sect; 13.27 to obtain a hearing. Neither was the contempt finding a prohibited bill of attainder because the Assembly did not find the protester guilty of a crime. The Assembly was in a valid special session when it made its resolution even though it had not adjourned its regular session. A special session could be called during the regular session.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state highway commission sought review of the decision from the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin), which found in favor of respondent corporation, in a proceeding in which the corporation claimed that the lowering of the grade of a highway caused the loss of 42 parking spaces for which the corporation was entitled to just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation claimed that the acquisition by the commission of a limited highway easement over its land together with the lowering of the grade of a highway caused the loss of 42 parking spaces and thus was a taking for which the corporation was entitled to just compensation. The commission did not obtain title in fee to any part of the corporation's land, the easement was used only while the regrading was occurring, the commission paid $ 10,000 for limited use and damages and offered to pay an additional $ 3,000, the physical boundaries of the corporation's land were not changed, and the actual cost to repair the parking area was $ 13,000. The trial court found in favor of the corporation. In reversing on appeal, the court held that: (1) where no physical barrier was permanently erected on the corporation's land that would prevent it from using the land in the same way it did prior to regrading, the corporation was not deprived of the beneficial use of its land and hence there was no taking; and (2) in the absence of a taking, the corporation was not entitled to just compensation for the diminution of the value of its property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decision from the trial court. The court held that there was no taking for which the corporation was entitled to just compensation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case of petitioner Attorney General (Wisconsin) against respondent Director of Finance (Wisconsin) sought a declaration that Chapter 3 of 1969 Wis. Laws, An Act to Create Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 20.250, 39.15, was valid. The Director argued that the Act violated Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 18, Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 31-32, Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10, Wis. Const.&nbsp;art. X, &sect; 6, or U.S. Const. amend. I. The Act concerned an appropriation to a medical school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The chapter made a token appropriation to a medical school for medical education and research. The medical school was a nonprofit corporation and was organized under Wis. Stat. &sect; 181. The governor's task force had recommended the appropriation because there was an above-average senior population and a decrease in physicians in the state. The court found that the Act was valid and constitutional. The appropriation was meant to benefit public health. The Act did not violate Wis. Const. art. X, &sect; 6, because public education by private institutions was not necessarily a private issue. It did not violate Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 10, because the medical school did not seek to profit private promoters. In addition, education, research, and teaching were not &quot;internal improvements.&quot; It did not violate Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 18, or U.S. Const. amend. I, because the medical school was no longer a department of a religiously affiliated university, the curriculum was not religious, and the legislation was not aimed at advancing religion. The Act did not violate Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 31-32, because the appropriation granted funds rather than corporate power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidation of cases, plaintiff optometrist appealed the judgments of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which affirmed respondent Wisconsin Board of Examiners in Optometry (board)'s decision that the optometrist had violated Wis. Admin. Code &sect; Opt. 7.04. The optometrist had challenged the constitutionality and legislative authorization of Rule 7.04 under Wis.

The trial court found that all the required tests were reasonable and that Rule 7.04 and the board composition were constitutional. The court agreed with the board and trial court. The court found, inter alia, that (1) the fact that experts disagreed on the desirability of a particular standard was not necessarily a valid objection to such standard; (2) inconsistencies in the enforcement of administrative rules did not, standing alone, invalidate an otherwise valid regulation; (3) the promulgation of Rule 7.04 was authorized by Wis. Stat. &sect; 153.08(1)(a) and thus was enforceable by the board; (4) the challenge to the statutory composition of the board was a question of public policy that was for the legislature to debate and decide, short of the constitutional requirements; and (5) a member of a certain profession was not disqualified by that fact from serving on an administrative board dealing with such profession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant railway companies challenged an order from the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which found that Wis. Stat. &sect; 192.25(2), requiring a fireman in a five-man crew inroad or outside of yard freight service, was constitutional. The trial court concluded that Wis. Stat. &sect; 192.25(4), requiring a three-man crew in a single engine, and Wis. Stat. &sect; 192.25(4a), requiring a five-man crew for switching operations, were not constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reviewed the Wisconsin full-crew legislation to determination whether it was without reasonable basis. The record contained no meaningful estimate of the cost of the fireman requirement; thus the court could not conclude that the cost was arbitrary, confiscatory, or unreasonably burdensome in view of the safety objective. The court agreed that Wis. Stat. &sect; 192.25(2) was constitutional because the lookout, signal passing, and engineer relief duties of a fireman could have been accepted by the legislature as having a substantial relation to railroad safety. The court affirmed the finding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 192.25(4) was unconstitutional because the requirement for a three-man crew in a light engine with no cars attached could not be justified. The court reversed the finding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 192.25(4a), requiring a fireman for switching operations, was not a constitutional exercise of police power because the increased safety was sufficient to withstand a due process challenge. The exemption for railroads operating less than 10 miles did not deny the railroad companies equal protection because the classification was germane to safety and was distinctive and meaningful.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that those portions of the Wisconsin full-crew law requiring a fireman in a five-man crew inroad or outside of yard freight service or for switching operations was constitutional, but the requirement for a three-man crew in a light engine with no cars attached could not be justified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission apportioned 100 percent of the cost of maintenance of certain of the state's railroad-highway underpasses to the railroad, with no apportionment of the cost to the state highway department. The railroad contested the assessment, and the trial court found in favor of the commission. The railroad appealed, and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that it was inherently unjust and unreasonable to subject the railroad to the contingency of repairing or replacing the structures in the event of a disaster, deterioration, or serious accident. Such responsibilities should have been fairly apportioned between the state and the railroad. Therefore, even though Wis. Stat. &sect; 84.05 and Wis. Stat. &sect; 195.29(2) were constitutional and did not authorize an improper delegation of legislative power to the commission, the commission's apportionment was arbitrary and capricious and not supported by substantial evidence. The railroad derived some benefits from the construction, and it had an obligation to share in the cost of promoting public safety and convenience of travel, but it was not an insurer of the future of the new structures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment affirming the commission's order making assessments for maintenance against the railroad and remanded the action for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">From an examination of the record, the court found that the dismissal of defendant's answer and counterclaim was in the nature of a punishment for not being ready for trial on the trial date. In a sense it was based on a contempt of court, although the trial court did not make a finding of contempt. Defendant asked for his day in court, but the trial judge did not allow his case to go to trial even though defendant was unprepared. The court held the trial court had an inherent power to dismiss a complaint and also to strike an answer and grant a default judgment, but whether such power was inherent or given by statute, the exercise of the power was limited by the requirement of due process of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend XIV. The court concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment was violated when defendant's answer was stricken and a default judgment entered for contempt because there were no established court rules promulgated covering such a result.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision that the list of teachers being sought by the minority unions was public information and therefore available to them. The court held that the failure to object to the WERC's construction of a statute amounted to a tacit approval and therefore, Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A municipality passed an ordinance that delegated to the chief of police the authority to investigate the business and moral character of an applicant for a transient merchant's permit and to issue or deny a permit based on his findings. Pursuant to the ordinance, the circulation manager applied for a permit to distribute a magazine in the municipality. The police chief denied the application on the ground that the magazine contained obscene matter. The circulation manager filed an action to challenge the police chief's action, claiming that with regard to publications, the ordinance violated U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 3, both on its face and as applied to him. The trial court entered a writ of prohibition in favor of the circulation manager. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the licensing requirement of the ordinance, as applied to the circulation manager and the magazine, constituted an impermissible prior restraint on speech. The court noted that the ordinance granted the police chief the right to censor publications without subsequent judicial review and without any definition of what was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner moved for a jury trial, but claimed that the jury fee was unconstitutional. The circuit judge ruled that the statute was constitutional and that petitioner was entitled to a jury trial. The judge's memorandum opinion, however, did not direct the clerk to call a jury. Petitioner appealed. The clerk of courts moved to dismiss the appeal. The court denied the motion. On reconsideration, the court noted that the appeal was not taken from a judgment because the circuit court did not enter one. As such, the order was not appealable. Further, the court found that the question sought to be litigated was moot because defendant had been afforded a jury trial. Accordingly, petitioner's demand for a jury without payment of statutory costs was a moot question. Thus, the court dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issue before the trial court was whether the establishment of a sewage district was proper. The trial court, in an attempt to avoid the constitutionality of the statute, found that the sewage district was appropriate and established a metropolitan sewage district. On appeal the court reversed the judgment, finding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.202 was unconstitutional. The court noted that the statute required the court to determine what was in the best interest of the city. The court held that what was desirable or advisable ought to be was a question of policy, not a question of fact. What was necessary or what was in the best interest was not a fact and its determination by the judiciary was an exercise of legislative power when each involved political considerations. The court concluded that &sect; 66.202 purported to delegate to the county court a question that was not factual. What was best or should not be were political questions and not questions of fact.

In affirming the trial court's order that affirmed the order that overruled defendants' demurrers, the court found that the joint venturers had a vested right to purchase the acres of property after entering the agreement. The court also determined that the joint venturers' complaint stated a cause of action for specific performance because of the parties' agreement regarding the purchase of property. In reversing that portion of the trial court's order that sustained respondents' demurrers, the court concluded that Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which found in favor of respondent state Division of Motor Vehicles, in an action challenging statutes pertaining to the operation of motorcycles, Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 347.485(2), 347.486(1), 347.485(1)(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged three statutes,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 347.485(2), 347.486(1), 347.485(1)(a), arguing that they protected the motorcycle driver or rider only against himself, and were outside the scope of the police power authority of the state. The court disagreed. The court held that under &sect; 347.485(2), requiring protection for the eyes was clearly related to the accident-causing possibility of dust, dirt, pebbles, even rain or snow, coming in contact with the unshielded eyes of a motorcycle driver. Regarding &sect; 347.486, the court found that prohibition of tilted or elevated handlebars which lifted hands, wrists and arms skyward was related to the necessity of having a motor-driven vehicle under proper control, which was related to preventing accidents and to the well-being of other users of the highway. Regarding &sect; 347.485 requiring protective headgear for motorcyclists, the court held that the presence of a protective helmet might make less likely the diverting of attention or loss of control of the cycle by its driver. Other users of the highway had a definite and legitimate interest in seriousness of consequences of an accident, as the state was a comparative negligence state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee sought to recover full pay for his military leave with the National Guard. The employee appealed, arguing that Milwaukee, Wis. Ordinances &sect; 2-235.5 was an unconstitutional denial of equal protection because it allowed full pay for veterans on military leave, but not for the employee, a nonveteran military reservist. The court held that even if the ordinance was unconstitutional, the employee had no cause of action because there was no effective law that gave the employee a right to the relief he sought. The ordinance did not deny the employee's right to equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the United States Constitution because there was a basis for the classifications in the ordinance between veterans and non-veterans. The ordinance did not conflict with Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 21.14 and 21.145 because it did not deprive the employee from continuing to enjoy the benefits of his employment. The trial court did not err in construing the ordinance by using Wis. Stat. &sect; 45.35 to determine veteran status because while the ordinance did not incorporate the definition of veteran as found in &sect; 45.35(5a), the ordinance incorporated the war dates as found in &sect; 45.35(5a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants participated in demonstrations at a university and were charged with disorderly conduct, Wis. Stat. &sect; 947.01. Defendants claimed that &sect; 947.01 was vague and overly broad so as to deprive them of due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and was unconstitutional as applied to them, that the trial court erred in instructing the jury, and that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendants severance of trial. The court held that &sect; 947.01 was not vague because it sufficiently identified the type of behavior that the legislature intended to be contrary to law and that it was not so broad that its sanctions could apply to conduct protected by the constitution. The court found that the jury instructions properly provided the jury with the two elements of disorderly conduct: that defendants engaged in disorderly conduct and that such conduct tended to cause or provoke a disturbance. Finally, the court upheld the trial court's refusal to grant severance of the trials because co-defendants did not assert antagonistic defenses and thus there was no prejudice. The court affirmed defendants' convictions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the motion, and defendant was subsequently convicted of the misdemeanor offense. On appeal, defendant contended that the change of venue statute,&nbsp;Wis.

Defendant also contended that the trial court improperly quashed a subpoena served upon a witness that defendant desired to call in his defense. The court affirmed. The court held that the statute was constitutional on its face and as applied in this case. The court held that there was a sufficient difference between a felony and a misdemeanor to warrant the distinction in the change of venue statute and further that it would be extremely unusual for a community as a whole to prejudge the guilt of any person charged with a misdemeanor.

The court affirmed the judgment against defendant. The court found that the temporary imposition of a curfew that was limited in time and reasonably made necessary by prevailing conditions was a legitimate and proper exercise of the police power of public authority.The court concluded that the trial court properly found that the search was reasonable and admitted into evidence the marijuana that was contained an unsealed envelope that a police officer found in defendant's waistband during a search for weapons.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The condemnor brought a condemnation action against the landowners. After a jury verdict was rendered, the landowners sought new trial on the ground that they were improperly subject to the burden of proof pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 32.06(10), which classified them as the plaintiff in the condemnation action. The landowner argued on appeal that when the condemnor appealed the burden was unreasonable and arbitrary. The court held that the legislature had the authority to modify the burden of proof as it desired, and that the landowners in a condemnation action had no vested right in the burden of proof or any other evidentiary rule. In reversing the order for a new trial, the court held that &sect; 32.06(10) did not violate the due process provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment or Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Because the condemnor was required to determine the necessity of the taking, appraise the property, attempt to negotiate a sale, and make a jurisdictional offer, the procedure for condemnation was inherently fair and the shift of the burden of proof did not remove any rights from the landowners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">It was the position of the parent that Wis.

The court reversed and held that the statutory language of &sect; 121.54 was plain and unambiguous that the &quot;over two mile&quot; provision for mandatory transportation did not apply to pupils who reside in cities, and that the school board had not provided for such transportation. The court held that the classification of students who resided within a city more than two miles from their school was a reasonable classification and that the school board properly exercised its discretion in declining to provide transportation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the imposition of a greater sentence upon one who successfully pursued a postconviction remedy resulting in resentencing unconstitutionally inhibited the seeking of postconviction redress. He argued that his right to challenge the proceedings that led to his conviction and sentence should not be conditioned upon his willingness to submit to the risk of an increased punishment. The court held that the proper standard was that on resentencing following a second conviction after retrial, or mere resentencing, the trial court was barred from imposing an increased sentence unless (1) events occurred or came to the sentencing court's attention subsequent to the first imposition of sentence which warrant an increased penalty; and (2) the court affirmatively stated its grounds in the record for increasing the sentence. Defendant argued that the trial court did not have any new facts at the resentencing to warrant an increased penalty. The State argued that the trial court first became aware of defendant's past three felony convictions at the resentencing. The court was not convinced that the trial court properly stated its grounds for the increase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The passenger alleged that the bus company had a duty to discharge her to a safe stopping place both under the common law and under Milwaukee, Wi., Ordinance 101-116(m). The ordinance required buses to stop in a manner that allowed passengers to step directly onto the sidewalk or curb without entering the public highway. The court affirmed the order. The bus company had no common-law duty requiring it to discharge passengers onto the curb or to warn passengers of the height of the step down from the bus. As to the ordinance violation, the court held that while violation of a safety statute was negligence per se, it was the court's duty not to extend liability beyond the policy established by the city council in passing the ordinance. Because the ordinance did not clearly and beyond any reasonable doubt express a purpose to prevent falls from stepping down to the street in language that was clear, unambiguous, and peremptory, the court held that its violation did not establish negligence per se. Milwaukee, Wi., Ordinances 102(43)(a), (64), controlling parking and stopping, did not apply because they were expressly made inapplicable to the loading or unloading of passengers.</SPAN></P>

The petition sought to enjoin the attorney from acting as a real estate broker because he was not licensed under the state's real estate broker licensing statute found at Wis. Stat. ch. 136.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney was acting as a real estate broker, even though he was not licensed. The Board initiated an action against the attorney for injunctive relief. The trial court granted the Board's petition. The attorney alleged that: (1) he was denied equal protection rights; (2) &sect;&sect; 136.01(2), 136.02 and 136.08(1a) were void for vagueness; (3) the continuation of the attorney's activities would not cause injury to the public interest; and (4) there was lack of due process if the Board was granted relief. In affirming the decision, the court found that statute was constitutional in that the classification, which excluded certain persons from the licensing requirements, was reasonable. The sections were not vague because the term &quot;pattern&quot; found in the sections suggested ongoing instances of selling real estate. The legislature determined that acting as a real estate broker without a license caused injury to the public interest, so that the attorney's continued activities would cause injury. The attorney was not deprived of due process rights because he received a hearing whether the Board chose to seek injunctive relief or undertake an investigation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant allegedly tried to solicit money from people to ensure his support of a highway bill. The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the statute under which defendant was charged was not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that there were evidentiary errors which led to the trial court's determination that there was a failure of proof. The court reviewed the trial court's admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion but concluded that if the exercise of discretion was based upon an error of law, it was beyond the limits of discretion. The court found that the trial court based the exclusion of the State's witness on an error of law because the witness could not remember the exact date that defendant approached him. The court held that the testimony could be probative of defendant's scheme whether it occurred before or after the date of the charged crime. The court found that there had to be evidence in the record that discretion was properly exercised and there was none. The court concluded that the error was prejudicial because it prevented the State from showing defendant's design, plan, or intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city argued that the legislative grant to the county to construct and tax for the purpose of constructing refuse-disposal facilities infringed on the home-rule rights of municipalities contained in Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3. The city also argued that the delegation of the power to construct and finance refuse-disposal plants only to counties having a population of 500,000 or more violated Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 23. The court affirmed the order, concluding that the home-rule amendment was not applicable because it was not intended to limit the power of the State to deal with its own agencies. The court reasoned that Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 23 was constitutional because the government of one county could vary from that of the other counties, provided that the system remained untouched, that in their details the governments varied only to the extent that it was impracticable for them to be uniform, and that the classifications were reasonable. The court found that the size of the county and the high concentration of population in larger counties compelled the conclusion that the legislative treatment of large counties was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with intentionally encouraging or contributed to the delinquency of a child. As a result, the State subjected defendant to an inquest. On review, the issue raised was whether defendant was entitled to an absolute dismissal of the pending criminal action because he was deprived of his rights to due process, fair trial and a remedy for his grievance. The court held that the inquest, although conducted by the district attorney on behalf of the State and resulting in publicity, stood on no different footing in respect to prejudicial pretrial publicity than other pretrial activity; therefore, the court found that the facts did not warrant the termination of all criminal proceedings against defendant. The court also held that it was impossible to have a speedy trial and also claim such a trial was prejudicial and unfair because it was held too speedily. Likewise, the court held that dismissal of the charges was too drastic a cure for the alleged infirmity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant driver brought an action against defendants, a driver who was a state employee and the driver's insurer, and respondent State of Wisconsin. The Circuit Court for Outagamie County (Wisconsin) sustained the State's demurrer and dismissed it as a party in the action pursuant to Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 27. The driver sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was in the course of his employment at the time he was involved in the automobile accident. The trial court concluded that the implementation of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 27, to direct when suits may be brought against the State was a legislative matter, and that Wis. Stat. &sect; 270.58, which provided for the payment by the state of a judgment against a public employee when he was acting in good faith, did not support a claimed right of direct suit against the State. On review, the court affirmed, holding that the mere labeling of the conduct of the State as negligent did not in any way imply that the legislature had waived the State's immunity from suit or given legislative consent for an action against the State through the use of &sect; 270.58. The mandate of Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 27 was not self-executing but rather was in fact highly discretionary, leaving to the legislature to direct in what manner and in what courts suits may be brought. Further, the court noted that there was no threat to constitutional government to justify any judicial action in light of the legislature's inaction.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 66.016(1)(a) and (b) did not constitute an invalid delegation of legislative power because the director did not have the authority to reject a petition arbitrarily, capriciously, or without reason. Next, the court noted that the director dismissed the citizens' petition because it failed to meet the requirements of &sect; 66.106(1). The court held that after the director dismissed the citizens' petition he was not required to and did not determine whether the public interest standards set forth in &sect; 66.016(2) were met by the citizens' petition. Therefore, the court held that the citizens did not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of &sect; 66.106(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner determined that plaintiffs' vehicles were not &quot;implements of husbandry&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 340.01(24). Plaintiffs filed a declaratory judgment action against the Commissioner. The Commissioner filed a motion to dismiss arguing that such a lawsuit was prohibited by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and that a petition for a declaratory ruling of the Commissioner pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.06 was the exclusive means of procedure for such a challenge. The trial court denied that motion and held that an action under Wis. Stat. &sect; 269.56 could be brought against the Commissioner. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. Plaintiffs' action could be maintained because it alleged that the Commissioner was acting outside the bounds of his constitutional or jurisdictional authority by misconstruing Wis. Stat. &sect; 340.01(24). The issue of whether the vehicle was an &quot;implement of husbandry&quot; was a question that involved the construction, interpretation, and application of the statutory language. Therefore, it was not an action against the state but against the Commissioner in his individual capacity. Wis. Stat. &sect; 227.06 was not plaintiffs' exclusive remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The hotel did not have sinks in all of its second-class units as required by the city's housing code. The Commissioner issued an order requiring compliance with the code, but the hotel challenged the order, claiming that because it had operated for over nine years without the sinks it had a variance in fact that could not be arbitrarily withdrawn. The trial court affirmed the order and the hotel appealed. In affirming, the court held that the city was not estopped from enforcing its housing ordinances. Although a properly granted variance could not be arbitrarily withdrawn, that rule only applied where variances were officially granted after due consideration. The hotel had never been granted a variance by the Commissioner pursuant to Milwaukee, Wis., Housing Ordinances &sect; 75-3(3); the most it could claim was that it had been violating the law for nine years and getting away with it. Milwaukee, Wis., Housing Ordinances &sect; 75-1, which required the installation of &quot;approved&quot; kitchen sinks, contained sufficient standards to save it from being unconstitutionally vague. The Commissioner, who had acted with considerable patience, had not acted arbitrarily in issuing the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant argued that the committee erred in permitting respondent to operate a branch office in the location of the savings and loan that respondent had absorbed because of the limitation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 215.13(39)(b). The court affirmed and held that &sect; 215.13(39)(b) did not apply because the committee allowed maintenance and operation of the branch under Wis. Stat. &sect; 215.13(40), which applied to branches created by absorption or consolidation. The court also held that Wis. Stat. &sect; 215.03(9)(a) did not apply to the creation of a branch through absorption. The section provided that any association that desired to establish a branch office subject to Wis. Stat. &sect; 215.13(39), must follow certain procedures and the court found that the word &quot;establish&quot; did not encompass branches which were created as a result of absorption or consolidation, therefore Wis. Stat. &sect; 215.03(9)(a) did not apply. The court further held that that interpretation did not result in an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the commissioner because he was bound to follow the standards set forth in Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 215.13(39)(b) and (40) and his discretion was limited by those standards.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, members of an agency school committee, sought review from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Jefferson County (Wisconsin), which granted summary judgment to respondent, the State Appeal Board. The members claimed that they were mere employees of the state and not officers, and hence, the delegation of legislative power to them was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The members chose to rest their case on the single issue of whether Wis. Stat. &sect; 117.03 resulted in an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. Their position was premised upon Wis. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. It was their contention that members of the agency school committee were mere employees of the state and not officers, and, hence, the delegation of legislative power to them was unconstitutional. The court found that the members of the appeal board were de facto officers. As members of the State Appeal Board, they had been vested by the legislature with the power to exercise a portion of the sovereign power of the state and that, as the holders of such power, which could be exercised by them without the control of a superior power other than the law itself, they were officers. The court reasoned that the principal consideration determining whether a position is an office and one holding it is an officer is the type of power that is wielded.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court denied the annexation petition, holding that &sect; 66.021(11)(b) was unconstitutional as an unauthorized delegation of legislative power to the judiciary. The circuit court found that the delegation was unconstitutional because it granted the circuit court an unlimited power to determine what constituted public interest and that the power was not limited by the definition of public interest in Wis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The school district maintained that it had no duty to negotiate with teachers over the school calendar. The Board determined that the parties had reached an impasse and the matter was subject to the fact finding procedure of Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.70(4)(e). Affirming the judgment, the court held that although a school board was not required to collectively bargain with teachers over the school calendar, it was required to confer and negotiate with teachers about the calendar. The language of Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.70(2) was sufficiently broad to cover the items constituting the school calendar. The days on which teachers must teach or be in service had a significant relationship to the hours and conditions, if not the salary, of teachers and rendered the school calendar negotiable. The school district's failure to come to an agreement placed it in the position in which the teachers could invoke the fact-finding procedure Wis. Stat. &sect; 111.70(4)(e).</SPAN></P>

She was to receive notice and a hearing before being permanently deprived of her property. The failure of Wis.

She could have obtained judicial review prior to the trial on the principal action as a result of the trial court's inherent power to control and regulate a proceeding upon summary process to correct any abuse or misuse of that process. The legislature did not assume judicial powers in violation of Wis. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2 by delegating to court personnel the responsibility of issuing summons to garnishees under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 66.058 imposed a license fee against operators of a mobile home park and required such licensee to collect a monthly parking permit fee from each occupant of a space or lot in a mobile home park, in an amount equal to the cost of services furnished by the school district. An occupant, who owned a mobile home, filed a declaratory judgment action against the city and others challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 66.058. On appeal from a judgment for the city and others, the court held that: (1) the fee constituted an excise tax on the parking of occupied trailers and not a property tax; (2) the occupants were the direct objects of the tax because the tax was to be &quot;collected&quot; from the occupants, and they were &quot;liable&quot; for such tax; (3) as such, the occupant had the right to institute a declaratory judgment action to determine the constitutionality of the tax because the tax was a direct tax to him for which he may be sued; and (4) a declaratory judgment gave the occupant the same type of &quot;review&quot; the owner received by the &quot;appeal&quot; provision, and hence, the occupant had an equally effective right of judicial review as that afforded the trailer park owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought a declaratory judgment determining that the coverage afforded by its policy to a contractor was secondary and applied only after the limits of the policy issued by respondent were exhausted. Respondent contended that since the injuries received by the employee of its insured were caused by the negligent acts of the contractor's employee, the appellant's policy was primary. On appeal, appellant argued that the trial court erred in dismissing its declaratory judgment action against respondent, and in denying its motions. Upon review, the court found appellant's arguments without merit. Appellant's liability was conditioned upon a final decision in litigation pending in Michigan regarding the contractor's employee or the contractor's negligence in causing respondent's insured's employee's injuries. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 269.56, courts could not declare rights until they were fixed under an established state of facts, and would not determine future rights in anticipation of an event that may not happen. Therefore, any consideration of declaratory relief was premature and the trial court properly exercised its discretion in refusing to enter a judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city appealed from a decision that found that property owned by a non-profit hospital that consisted of five homes, one duplex, and two four-unit apartment buildings was exempt from ad valorem taxes. The court stated that necessity existed for residents and interns to live in the immediate vicinity of the hospital for its benefit. The city argued that the tax-exempt status of the residences was doubtful because they were not expressly exempted by the statute and that when the legislature intended residences to be exempted it expressly so provided. The court stated that conducting an internship and residency program was a valuable and reasonably necessary function of a large modern hospital and to attain such purposes it was reasonably necessary for the non-profit hospital to offer housing accommodations to secure interns and residents. Such housing was used exclusively for hospital purposes and was thus, entitled to exemption from real-estate taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decision that found the non-profit hospital was exempt from ad valorem taxes on properties that were used exclusively for the purposes of the hospital was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant oil company sought to include various retail items to be sold to consumers in combination with the purchase of gasoline.

Litigation ensued and the trial court denied defendant's use of combination sales to prevent predatory sales practices. Defendant then challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 100.30 claiming that combination sales at face value did not divert trade. Upon final determination, the Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the statute was constitutionally sound because of a rational connection between intent to divert trade and the use of combination sales.</SPAN></P>

The secretary had no supervisory control over the installation of voting machines nor had he made any attempt to force cities to comply with the requirement. The secretary of state and the state raised the defense of sovereign immunity was a bar to the suit. The state also argued that the city lacked standing to sue the state or the secretary of state in a declaratory judgment action. The city argued that both defenses were waived by a failure to raise that defense at trial or by a failure to preserve the defense as a question for appeal. The court affirmed the judgment because municipalities had no standing to raise constitutional issues against the state.

The priority of ownership of a wrongful death action was first to the surviving spouse, second to a child or children, and third, to the parents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After being arrested on suspicion of burglary, defendant was taken to a police station at 10:45 p.m., placed in a cell overnight, and interrogated the next day without being fed breakfast. He claimed police threatened to &quot;rough him up&quot; after he stated that he was entitled to counsel. He confessed in writing to several burglaries early that afternoon. On appeal, the court noted that the interrogation predated the issuance of the Miranda rule and that defendant never directly requested counsel. A detective's reference to giving defendant a loaf of bread was a literary allusion, not a promise of food in exchange for a confession from a hungry man. Defendant's confession was voluntary. The fact that the State chose to dismiss an earlier burglary charge against him the day after the three instant charges were filed did not violate double jeopardy principles, even though defendant had confessed to all four crimes simultaneously. For purposes of double jeopardy analysis, the terms &quot;same transaction&quot; and &quot;same confession&quot; were not synonymous. Due process principles did not estop the State from prosecuting the instant charges after the first charge had been dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under the ordinances, a lump sum expense allowance was paid to the aldermen and the city attorney and no requirement was imposed that the expenses actually exceed or equal that figure or that the officials itemize such expenses in vouchers submitted to the City. The court affirmed the judgment upholding the ordinances against the taxpayers' challenge. The court held that the evidence supported the finding that the amounts provided for expense allowances for aldermen were reasonable. The fact that most aldermen had expenses which equaled or exceeded the expense allowance demonstrated that the amounts were not so plainly and palpably in excess of any amount of expenses which could possibly have been incurred so as to show that the council intended to increase their own salary in violation of Wis.

The court held that the $ 200 monthly stenographic expense account did not appear unreasonable or intended to compensate the city attorney who worked 90 hours a week.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that the trial court's ruling, that the juvenile witness' juvenile court record could only be released by the juvenile court, and the juvenile court's order, instructing the juvenile court clerk to disobey defendant's subpoena for the records, violated his constitutional rights. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court noted that, under the prohibitions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 48.38(1), the disposition of a juvenile's case and any evidence given in the juvenile court were not admissible as evidence against the juvenile in any case or proceeding in any other court. The court concluded that this prohibition, and the public policy for its enactment, required the protection of the juvenile not only when he was a party in an action but also when he was a witness. Thus, the court found that the juvenile court judge did not abuse his discretion when he refused to allow the release of the witness' juvenile record because that record could not be used to impeach the witness' testimony. Finally, the court determined that this was not a proper case for it to exercise its discretionary power under Wis. Stat. &sect; 251.09 to reverse in the interests of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relators, interested parties, challenged the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.071, concerning the application of the public-purpose doctrine. Respondent county officials appropriated public funds based on that legislation for the purposes of bringing private businesses into the community. It was alleged that the expenditure of funds did not meet the public-purpose standard.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Wisconsin legislature established Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.071, which resolved that the loss of industry affected the state and had caused an increase in unemployment. The economic impact was a menace to the general welfare of the entire state. The court found that &sect; 59.071 on its face did not violate the public-purpose provision of the Constitution and that relators failed to demonstrate how the provision was unconstitutional. The court noted that the authorization of the county's payment of $ 25,000 to the corporation was to be used in paying its operating expenses, which stood to improve the public need and public purpose, and the possibility of operational illegality did not of itself condemn the legislation. There was no potential conflict between state and local rights, and the court saw no need to engage in a balancing of interests: whether the state interest or the local interest was paramount. The Industrial Development Law permitted any county to form an industrial development agency and also permitted adjoining counties to form agencies together. As the need arose in various counties throughout the state, industrial development agencies could be created under &sect; 59.071(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ruled that the challenged statute was constitutional as applied to the public-purpose doctrine.</SPAN></P>

Ordinance No. 326 and regulating pool halls and billiard parlors, brought a habeas corpus proceeding alleging that the ordinance violated his equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) held that the ordinance was constitutional, and the inmate sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate contended that Milwaukee, Wis., Code &sect; 87-13.57 had no reasonable basis and was discriminatory because it regulated billiard parlors but not other recreational facilities, regulated only particular parlors, and excluded parlors with less than three tables. On review, the court held that there was a reasonable basis for the regulation of pool halls and billiard parlors under the municipality's exercise of its police power to protect the public welfare. The inmate failed to produce any evidence to overcome the presumption that the distinctions between classes of recreation or classes of pool halls were reasonable and proper. Legislation in the exercise of police power might proceed piecemeal depending on the seriousness of the problem presented. There was a reasonable basis for the ordinance's exclusion of pool tables on the premises of religious, charitable, educational, and fraternal organizations and at bona fide social clubs because these distinctions were germane to the purpose of the law, which was a strong policy toward supervision of play by minors. Similarly, there was a reasonable basis for excluding pool halls where there were less than three tables.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and declared the statute unconstitutional, holding that it violated the tax uniformity clause, Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1. The court noted that the clause had been approved and upheld in a number of cases. Pursuant to judicial precedent and interpretation of the clause, all property was treated as belonging to one constitutional class. All property within that class had to be taxed equally. Property not included in the class was exempt, but partial exemptions were prohibited. The statute allowed a &quot;freeze&quot; on assessments. By doing so the statute allowed for the unequal taxation of property and constituted a partial exemption from taxation. The court therefore held that the statute violated the constitutional uniformity requirement. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional because it granted urban redevelopment corporations partial exemptions from taxation. Based on its decision the court also enjoined the city from further implementation of the statute, but limited its ruling to prospective application only.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of attempting to entice a child under the age of 18 years into an automobile for immoral purposes. Defendant was committed to the department of public welfare as a sex deviate for treatment at its sex deviate facility under the act. Defendant challenged the validity of the information on the ground that there could have been no crime of attempted enticement because Wis. Stat. &sect; 944.12 was itself an attempt statute. Defendant also asserted that the information did not charge a crime because the charge was not in the words of the statute and the phrase &quot;for immoral purposes&quot; was too vague and indefinite. Lastly, defendant contended that the statutory procedure under which defendant was committed to a sex deviate facility was constitutionally invalid. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 959(1) created a completed crime, not an attempt statute, and that the failure to name the victim in the information, although a defect, was not objected to prior to trial. The court, however, reversed defendant's placement in a sex deviate facility because defendant was not afforded a hearing on the issue of the need for specialized treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties stated the issues to be: (1) whether the school committee abused its discretion by issuing an order from a petition, which was &quot;essentially similar&quot; to a petition acted upon by the school district during the same year; (2) whether the order of the school committee was void as arbitrary and an capricious abuse of power; and (3) whether Wis.

The court found that the order issued was pursuant to a resolution of the county school committee. The petition was no longer in being, inasmuch as it had been expressly denied at a hearing not held within 30 days after the petition was submitted. This being so, &sect; 40.03 (1) (a) was inapplicable. The court concluded that the school committee did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner. How boundaries in school districts should be changed was not a judicial determination.

The statute was designed to prevent a fraud upon an innkeeper and not merely to prevent the innkeeper from losing control of something on which he would otherwise have had a lien. The evidence in the case was sufficient to enable the trial court to find intent to defraud the hotel. The argument that &sect; 943.21 violated Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 was groundless. The offense under the statute was not the debtor's nonpayment but the fraud through which payment was evaded. Defendant surrendered himself in another state, waived extradition, and was returned to Wisconsin. When it was realized that defendant's arrest warrant was defective, the original action was dismissed. Defendant was lawfully within the jurisdiction of the Wisconsin courts when he voluntarily chose to remain in Wisconsin and submit to rearrest under a new warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent individuals brought an action in the Circuit Court for Brown County (Wisconsin) seeking a declaratory judgment against appellant corporations that a town zoning ordinance was unconstitutional and invalid under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A town zoning ordinance permitted a packing plant to operate in one parcel of the industrial district, but it did not permit such operation in the other three parcels in the same district. The individuals brought a declaratory judgment action to invalidate the ordinance. The corporations filed a motion for summary judgment, which was denied. The court affirmed the order denying the motion, ruling that municipal restrictions on the use of real and personal property had to be reasonable in the classification used. An ordinance that arbitrarily and unreasonably discriminated was void. Further, under &sect; 62.23(7), regulations for the industrial district had to be uniform and affect all land in the district alike. An ordinance regulating property use had to apply equally to all persons under similar or like circumstances. There had to be a reasonable basis for any different treatment. Under the ordinance, similar plants in the other parcels had to apply for permits to operate, while the corporations were exempt from seeking approval. The court ruled that the subject ordinance was a violation of &sect; 62.23(7) and was void because there was no reasonable basis for the different treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wisconsin had passed the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (Act). Section 964.03 of the Act provided that no demand for extradition could be recognized unless it was in writing showing that the accused was present in the demanding state at the time of the alleged crime and that he fled from that state. The Act also made the demand subject to federal constitutional and statutory law. The court ruled that the trial court made an error by not examining whether or not the accused's detention under the governor's warrant was legal and that the Indiana demanding documents did not meet the requirements of &sect; 964.03 or constitutional standards and that the rendition warrant had been illegally issued. According to the court, the demanding documents were insufficient because they did not show that the arrest warrant had been issued upon a determination of probable cause. Also the court found that Indiana did not follow its own procedures for extradition as Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 328.01 required that an arrest warrant for a fugitive be issued by a judge of the circuit, superior, criminal, or city court or a justice of the peace; a deputy clerk in Indiana had issued the arrest warrant for the accused.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner taxpayer filed a complaint against respondents, the Wisconsin Commissioner of Taxation and another, claiming that a limitation of the benefits of an income tax relief statute,&nbsp;Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.09(7), to persons 65 or older was an unreasonable and arbitrary classification that denied equal protection of the laws. Respondents filed a demurrer in response to the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer's action challenged the statute's constitutionality. The court determined that the statute's purpose was to provide income tax relief to the needy elderly aged 65 years or older with a certain household income. The court determined that the statute's relief was based on the cost of housing, as property taxes or rent. The action was dismissed and the demurrer was sustained. The court held that the statute did not deprive those who were denied its benefits of equal protection of the laws. The court held that the statute was exempted from Wis. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, which required uniformity of taxation, because it was a relief law, not a tax law. The court decided that the classification used in the statute was reasonably and fairly related to the statute's purpose. The court concluded that the statute applied with substantial equality to everyone in the class. The court found that the taxpayer failed to assert facts tending to establish that the statute would deprive any citizen of uniform treatment or equal protection of the laws. The court rejected the taxpayer's contention that the statute violated the uniformity clause because prior, similar legislation did.</SPAN></P>

However, no record to support this allegation was made at the time of the hearing on the motion to withdraw the guilty plea, and there were no supporting medical or other affidavits giving details to support the assertion. The court held that as a minimum, there had to be something in the record to establish the fact of incompetency at the time of the guilty plea. Defendant was not promised treatment for his addiction. The sentencing court had no power to commit defendant to the hospital for treatment because the offense was under Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.17, rather than under Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.02(3). Further, defendant entered his plea of guilty while represented by counsel and after being fully informed of the possible consequences of his guilty plea.

The accountant categorically denied having made any such representation. The trial court found that the accountant had not held himself out as a licensed or certified public accountant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that a person who held himself out as an accountant, but was not registered as a public accountant nor licensed as a CPA, did not violate Wis. Stat. &sect; 135.11(5) and (6). The court noted that what was prohibited was not the practicing of accountancy by unregistered or unlicensed accountants, but the use of their audits or reports under the guise that they were made by a CPA or public accountant. The court concluded that because the accountant did not violate the statute there was no illegality in his contract of employment by the client which would bar him from recovering the reasonable value of the services rendered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Wisconsin Legislature enacted Wis. Stat. &sect; 218.01(3) as part of the Wisconsin Auto Dealership Law. Implicit in this law was the recognition of the gross disparity of bargaining power between the manufacturer of automobiles and the local retailer, and the purpose of the law was to furnish the dealer with some protection against unfair treatment by the manufacturer. The applicant applied for a dealer application under &sect; 218.01(3). The Commissioner denied the application, concluding that the application was, in fact, that of a manufacturer. The lower court disagreed and reversed the Commissioner's ruling. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's decision. The statute's effect was not limited to the situation where a manufacturer was itself an applicant, and the conduct prohibited by the statute included the situation in the instant case where there was an objective showing that the manufacturer controlled the license applicant. Moreover, substantial evidence supported the Commissioner's findings that the application made in the name of the applicant was a dealer application of the manufacturer and that the applicant was a new, rather than a replacement dealership.</SPAN></P>

The guardian ad litem asserted that the 120-day notice requirement was a statute of limitation rather than a condition precedent to the right to maintain an action, that the notice requirement did not apply to minors as claimants, and that its application to minors was unconstitutional. The court on appeal affirmed the judgment of the trial court based on its determination that (1) the notice requirement in &sect; 81.15 was a condition precedent to the maintenance of a cause of action against the city and not a statute of limitation; (2) no exemption applied to minors from compliance with the notice requirement; and (3) the notice requirement did not violate the Due Process Clause of either the United States or Wisconsin Constitution because the 120-day notice requirement was not unjust or unreasonable and a parent or guardian could assist a minor in assuring compliance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Less than a year after the wife divorced her first spouse, the wife and her husband got married in a sister state to avoid the legal obstacle to such marriage imposed by Wisconsin. About 16 years later, the husband sought to annul the marriage by claiming that it was void. The trial court granted the wife a divorce. On review, the court found that both parties knew the wife's divorce in her first marriage was less than a year old at the time of their marriage, but despite such legal obstacle, the parties held themselves out to public notice in good faith as husband and wife, and two children were born of the marriage. Wis. Stat. &sect; 330.18(4), the Statute of Limitations of the State of Wisconsin, was applicable. Although the marriage was void under Wis. Stat. &sect; 245.03 (1947) or Wis. Stat. &sect; 245.04, the statute of limitations had run its course 10 years after the marriage, so as to extinguish the right and the remedy of annulment. For the first time at oral argument the husband claimed that the statute of limitations was not an available defense as it was waived under Wis. Stat. &sect; 263.12.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the property owner argued that (1) Green Bay, Wis., Ordinance &sect; 16.18(2)(i) was discriminatory as to gasoline stations and therefore unconstitutional; and (2) &sect; 16.18(2)(i) was unconstitutional because it operated as an ex post facto law.

The officer in charge of the traffic division of the city's police department testified that he had received numerous complaints from citizens, aldermen, and policemen in regard to those types of signs. In light of the distinctions which the officer testified actually existed, and in the absence of affirmative evidence demonstrating that the dissimilarities were unreal, &sect; 16.18(2)(i) was sustained as a valid exercise of the police power in the interests of public safety. Because it was not unreasonable to retroactively apply an ordinance which had a profound and substantial impact on a firm actually engaged in the billboard business, it was likewise not unreasonable to require the property owner to move two four-by-six-foot signs back several feet at most to conform to the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant village appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Waukesha County (Wisconsin), which ruled in favor of plaintiffs, a subdivider and others, and held that an ordinance under which the subdivider had been required to pay an equalization fee to obtain plat approval was unconstitutional. Plaintiffs also asserted that the ordinance levied a tax that was not authorized by the legislature and was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ordinance at issue required developers to dedicate a certain value per lot portion of each subdivision for school, park, and recreational needs. Where this was not practicable, the developer was required to pay an equalization fee per lot. The village asserted that the ordinance was a valid exercise of its police powers. The court initially considered the provision requiring the dedication of a portion of the subdivision and held that this requirement was authorized by Wis. Stat. &sect; 236.45(1) and (2). The court further held that the ordinance was a valid exercise of police power in that the evidence established that the village would be required to provide more land for schools, parks, and playgrounds as a result of the subdivision. The court applied the same reasoning with respect to the constitutionality of the equalization fee and held that it was also a reasonable exercise of the village's police power. The court finally concluded that the equalization fee was such a concomitant of the land-dedication provision of the ordinance that its authorization could be found in the language of &sect; 236.45(1) and (2).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review, the issues were whether the taxpayer's operations in Wisconsin were an integral part of a multistate unitary business, if so, whether it was mandatory that the apportionment method be used to compute the state taxable income, and, if so, whether the income of the taxpayer's wholly owned subsidiaries should have been included in the formula. The court reversed. The court found that there was ample credible evidence to find that the taxpayer was a unitary business and that the Wisconsin branches were an integral part thereof. The court determined that the Wisconsin branches were wholly dependent upon the home office for the only commodity upon which the taxpayer's business was based. The court also found that the department was not statutorily authorized to require a consolidated return. The court agreed with the trial court that the taxpayer's Wisconsin branches were an integral part of a multistate unitary business and that Wisconsin income tax had to be determined on an apportionment-basis formula, but disagreed in the determination that the operations of the subsidiary corporations should have been included in the apportionment formula.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the State Personnel Board (Wisconsin) and an individual, disputed a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dane County (Wisconsin), which, in an action brought by respondent, a person who had taken a civil service examination into the results of which veterans' preference points were factored, determined that the Board's method of factoring in the points was improper. A key issue was when in the exam process the points were factored in.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, it was apparent to the court that, to avoid disqualification of veterans after the written portion of the exam under the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 16.11(1), the director and the Board had adopted the practice of adding the veterans' preference points to the grades obtained on the written examination to bring them up to a passing grade. The court concluded that the practice in effect would allow some but not all veterans to utilize preference points twice. The court found no authority for that interpretation and application either in the language of the statute or by fair implication. If the practice were permitted, it in effect allowed a special class of persons to be qualified who had not met the statutory minimum requirements. If such were the intention of the legislature, the statute would probably be unconstitutional. Further, there was no ambiguity or lack of administrative direction to justify that interpretation and application of the statute. The court agreed with the trial court's analysis and construction of Wis. Stat. &sect; 16.18(1). The court held that veterans' preference points could not be added to the grade until the entire examination had been completed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a pro se motion for rehearing in which he raised issues that were not addressed in his original appellate brief. Defendant argued that the statutes under which his arrest warrant was issued were unconstitutional, that the warrant was invalid for failure to state sufficient essential facts, and that he was denied constitutionally adequate legal representation at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Because defendant was an indigent prisoner acting without benefit of counsel, the court considered his motion for rehearing even though it raised issues not previously raised on original appeal or by writ of error. Any invalidity in his original arrest was rendered entirely immaterial by defendant pleading guilty to the information without raising any issue with respect to the validity of the arrest. Because his counsel first refused his appointment and then reluctantly accepted it, defendant contended his counsel provided a half-hearted defense. The record did not substantiate this contention. The only specific complaint defendant raised against counsel was his failure to raise the issue of illegal arrest. A finding of inadequate representation could not be grounded on this allegation. His counsel could gain no advantage for defendant by invalidating the arrest because defendant was subject to rearrest on a valid warrant. An exception to this would have occurred if a search and seizure was grounded upon the arrest and the invalidating of the arrest would have invalidated the search and seizure, but there was no claim of any search and seizure incident to the arrest.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment. The fact that a statute failed to itemize with particularity every possible kind of conduct which would violate it did not make it constitutionally vague. The term &quot;disorderly conduct&quot; was usually held to embrace all such acts and conduct as were of a nature to corrupt the public morals or to outrage the sense of public decency, whether committed by words or acts. There was sufficient evidence for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the requirements imposed to preserve order were made known to defendants and were knowingly violated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner pleaded guilty to burglary and his parole on murder sentences was revoked. He filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus contesting his burglary conviction, contending that the trial court failed to provide him with an attorney at his &quot;arraignment&quot; in violation of the Sixth Amendment and that his confessions that were admitted at trial were involuntary. The trial court denied the writ, holding that counsel represented him at the preliminary examination on the two amended counts of first-degree murder, at the subsequent arraignment in circuit court when he first entered a plea, and in all phases of the circuit court proceedings, both before and after the trial. Thus, there was no merit to his claim that he was denied counsel at any stage in the proceedings. The court further held that petitioner's counsel failed to object to the admission of petitioner's confessions for strategic reasons, and that, therefore, petitioner waived any constitutional defect that there may have been in that procedure. That a conviction resulted was not enough to declare that the trial technique was so unwise or questionable as to relieve petitioner of the consequences of his counsel's waiver.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a declaratory judgment adjudicating the ordinance valid and constitutional. It held that the ordinance was not void and ineffective even though no consent was obtained from the county board of supervisors because it was not the legislative intent that &sect; 62.23 was applicable to interim extraterritorial zoning ordinances and applied only to master zoning plans initiated by a city plan commission. Further, the act was a reasonable and valid exercise of police power.

The Circuit Court of Dane County (Wisconsin), entered judgment for the manufacturer, and the Board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacturer made and sold a single vented fitting for plumbing fixtures. The Board issued a letter to all plumbers advising that single vent systems were not in conformity with Wisconsin law.

The Board presented testimony that the such fittings failed maximum severity tests. The court held that the circuit court was expressly provided jurisdiction by Wis.

Other sections of the Code that prohibited the use of the fitting did not apply, as they conflicted with Wis. Stat. &sect; 145.01. Those provisions were constitutionally void. The standards of conduct were to be judged under conditions of ordinary use and not under maximum severity tests.

On review, the court reversed and remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint because it failed to allege a justiciable controversy. The assembly was attempting to resolve a dispute as to whether the assemblyman or the contestant had won the election, a matter that was solely for the legislature to decide, not the courts. No jurisdiction existed because the facts did not support a claim that the assembly was trying remove an existing member of the assembly. The assembly's actions in seating the assemblyman, of assigning him to a committee, and of allowing him to vote were done with the full knowledge of the contestant's notice of contest.

Stat. &sect; 59.03(2) specified the composition of county boards of supervisors in all Wisconsin counties excepting Milwaukee and Menominee counties. In an action for declaratory relief, it was alleged that &sect; 59.03(2) resulted in large disparities in county-board representation, such that a small minority of citizens in many counties could have controlled a majority of the votes cast by their supervisors. The court declared that &sect; 59.03(2) was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. On its face, &sect; 59.03(2) did not purport to provide for the election of county-board members on an equal-population basis. The one man-one vote principle applied.

He alleged error as not obtaining his express consent to be tried before less than 12 jurors, that merely filing an information was insufficient for prosecuting him, and that the interests of justice required a new trial pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 251.09. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, concluding that defendant's silence, when his attorney confirmed that he had stipulated to a jury of six, constituted consent to that agreement. The court also held that precedence showed that basing defendant's prosecution on an information, rather than on an indictment, did not violate his rights under the Fifth Amendment. The court also held that the manner in which defendant obtained and used the car with which he was convicted of stealing and the other evidence showed that there was sufficient evidence for the conviction and that there was no miscarriage of justice that required a new trial. The court further determined that two prosecutors showed no prejudice as to cross-examination and that defendant's sentence was within the statutory limits and was not shown to have been an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court noted that in order to find a valid gift of corporate shares, it was necessary for a certificate to have been issued and an entry to have been made on the books of the corporation. The court reasoned that prior to such an entry, the decedent was free to withdraw his gift or destroy the stock certificate. The court also rejected the son's claim that the treatment of a close corporation was different than a large corporation was unconstitutional, in that the transaction in the instant case required the certificate as well as the donative intent of the entry on the corporate books, holding that the claim was without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Denying the motion, the court rejected each of defendant's arguments. The court noted that the controlling definition of a narcotic drug clearly included paregoric, which contained opium. As to the questioned jury instruction, the court held that error could not be predicated upon an instruction to the jury without first moving for a new trial in the trial court, which was not done.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 40.035, all territories in the state of Wisconsin were required to be within school districts that operated high schools. There were certain territories not in conformity with this requirement and the superintendent affirmed an order attaching certain territory to the city's school district. In making the determination, the superintendent relied on facts and information not produced at a hearing and without providing a court-type hearing. The city, electors, and a parent sought review of the superintendent's decision and the trial court affirmed the decision. On appeal, the court held that the city had no capacity to raise the constitutionality of a statute applying to a state official. The court found that parents had no constitutionally protected right to the school-district boundaries for its children. The court ruled that the matter was not a contested case, but rather an exercise of a legislative function by the superintendent and the superintendent was not required to provide a court-type hearing prior to making his determination to assign a territory to the city's school district.</SPAN></P>

The court issued a show cause order as to why leave should not be granted. Thereafter, the court held that the petition would serve as a declaratory judgment complaint. The county clerk asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction over the action because the clerk had not been personally served. The court overruled the demurrer. Wis. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3, contemplated that the Wisconsin Supreme Court exercise its discretion when taking jurisdiction of cases affecting the rights and liberties of the people of the state. When a justiciable controversy existed, an action for declaratory judgment simply brought the controversy before the court for resolution at an earlier stage than under traditional procedures. The court held that it had personal jurisdiction because the county clerk had been served a copy of the show cause order. Service of summons, normally required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 262.02(1), was not required in original jurisdiction cases. The service of the show cause order was sufficient to apprise the clerk of the nature of the allegations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court issued an order that required respondents to show cause why relators' petition should not have been granted. After oral argument and briefs, the court granted leave to relators to commence an original action for declaratory judgment and appropriate relief. Respondents demurred, asserting that the court lacked personal jurisdiction and that relators' complaint failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The court found that Wis. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3 contemplated the court taking jurisdiction over cases that affected important public rights and liberties, and noted that in the past the court exercised original jurisdiction over declaratory judgment actions. Respondents asserted that because no summons was served the court obtained no personal jurisdiction under Wis. Stat. &sect; 262.02(1). The court pointed out that while it was a court of record as contemplated by the statute, it was not ordinarily considered as having had concurrent jurisdiction with a circuit court. The court held that no summons was required because the service that gave personal jurisdiction was the service of the notice of application of leave and the order to show cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The creditor executed a judgment lien against the debtor's interest in a land contract.

The debtor argued that the bankruptcy determination was res judicata and could not be collaterally attacked. The trial court disregarded the bankruptcy determination and entered judgment. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The bankruptcy referee had authority to determine the applicable exemption. Although he erroneously determined the exemption amount, his determination that the creditor's judgment was not a lien on the real estate could not be collaterally attacked. The debtor's interest in the land contract was personalty not subject to the creditor's judgment lien.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of taking or using narcotic drugs without a prescription for permitted use. He appealed, but the court affirmed the judgment. Even though defendant argued that Wis. Stat. &sect; 161.02(3) was unconstitutional because it imposed cruel and unusual punishment in making it a crime for a person to take or use narcotics without a prescription, the court rejected such contention because defendant was not charged with being an addict but with a specific act of taking and using drugs without a prescription. The police conduct in conducting an investigation seeking evidence to establish &quot;probable cause&quot; was reasonable, and the investigation did produce probable cause to believe defendant was violating &sect; 161.02(3), so the arrest was validly executed. Because the search pursuant to the arrest was reasonable under the circumstances, the physical evidence seized pursuant to the search was properly admitted into evidence against defendant. The trial court had reasonable grounds for a good-faith belief that defendant lacked the capacity to appreciate his circumstances in the trial and to intelligently waive his right to appointed counsel, as he had previously requested.</SPAN></P>

The widow had sought duty disability benefits, a widow's compensation annuity, and a supplemental annuity. The circuit court granted mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city fought the widow's award on the grounds that an earlier decision of the Industrial Commission in a workman's compensation proceeding was res judicata. The Board awarded benefits, but the city treasurer refused to make payment. A year passed, and the widow and Board commenced an action in the circuit court seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the city treasurer to make the payments. The circuit court granted the writ. On review, the court affirmed the decision, holding that the city had failed to pursue its statutory remedy by way of certiorari to the circuit court as provided by Milwaukee, Wis., Ordinance No. 237. The ordinance was enacted pursuant to a legislative directive, and the city council had not unilaterally altered the jurisdiction of a state court. By failing to seek review by certiorari within a reasonable time, the city had acquiesced in the Board's decision, and mandamus could be used to enforce the widow's rights. The court held that henceforth, the reasonable time for filing certiorari was six months. The res judicata claim was a question on the merits and could not be raised and adjudicated collaterally in this mandamus proceeding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

A portion of the monorail fell on the worker and injured him. A jury found that the company was causally negligent in the manner in which it erected the monorail system. On appeal, the company argued that &sect; 330.155, which was enacted after the action was commenced, barred the worker's action and the evidence did not support the jury's finding. The court held that because the action arose under the common law and was pending at the time &sect; 330.155 was created, it could not be taken away from the worker. The legislature had no power to interfere with vested rights of action after suit had been commenced. A statute of limitations could not operate retroactively to the extent of defeating actions that were commenced prior to its enactment. The jury was properly instructed as to proof of any negligence, and there was sufficient credible evidence to support its verdict. Because a supervisor had observed the monorail system and had personal knowledge thereof, it was proper to permit him to give his opinion to a direct question without the use of a hypothetical question.</SPAN></P>

In support of their contention that Wis. Stat. &sect; 76.28 was unconstitutional, appellants made two main arguments. First, they argued that &sect; 76.28(3) was void for indefiniteness and uncertainty. While the court agreed that the legislative intent behind the various distinctions drawn among communities based on size was not crystal clear, the court disagreed that the statute was so confounding as to be constitutionally offensive. Second, appellants argued that &sect; 76.28 was arbitrary and capricious in its classifications, contrary to the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court disagreed, holding that distinctions among municipalities on the basis of their respective populations were acknowledged by the Wisconsin courts as germane and relevant to the purpose of legislation. The court held that the statute's constitutionality was properly asserted in this case notwithstanding the rule that municipalities could not challenge state legislation, because the individual property owners, electors, citizens, and taxpayers did not suffer from the same limitations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent building inspector refused to issue a permit to repair the building to the insureds because the repair estimate exceeded 50 percent of the assessed value, which was the maximum amount permitted to be spent under Madison, Wis., Ordinance &sect; 16.05(3)(c). The insurers sought review and reversal of the inspector's ruling by the Madison Zoning Board of Appeals, and the Zoning Board denied the request for review. The court granted the petition for a writ of certiorari. The court stated that there was no basis upon which to conclude that the insurers obtained any benefit from the existence of &sect; 16.05(3)(c). The existence and application of &sect; 16.05(3)(c) served only to broaden the scope of the insurers' liability under the standard fire policy. The fire damage amounted to no more than 26 percent of the building's fair market value, and the prohibition against repair stemmed from a substantial underassessment of the property. Also, the only respect in which the building was nonconforming was the inadequacy of side yards. Faced with such a combination of circumstances, the court held that the Zoning Board's refusal to grant the variance was arbitrary and an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the instant case, the alleged agreement was oral, and the putative father had died before the daughter attempted to obtain legal enforcement of the alleged agreement. Nevertheless, the court considered that the impact of Wis. Stat. &sect; 52.28, would be applicable even if the agreement were in writing and even if the claimed father were alive. That was because &sect; 52.28 by its own language was broad enough to cover all settlement agreements between an alleged father and the mother of an illegitimate child. The statute provided that no other agreement or settlement of any paternity proceeding shall be valid, and the court believed that the legislature intended to bar enforcement of those arrangements which did not comply with the statutory plan. The court concluded that the trial court properly sustained the demurrer since the alleged contract was not entered into in compliance with the statute which furnished the exclusive procedure for the creation of an enforceable contract for the support of an illegitimate child between the mother and the putative father.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 252.071 (1959) on its face, appeared to require the payment demanded by the official.

The court concluded that the auditor had standing to challenge the validity of the ordinance that increased the salaries, and of the statute that appeared to authorize the ordinance. The court held that a grant of additional salary by the county board was an increase in compensation as of the date the county board made it effective, and it followed that payment of such an increase could not be made to the official during the term which had commenced prior to that date. The court observed that the term &quot;public officer&quot; was an officer receiving a fixed salary payable out of the treasury of the State. No writ was issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Governor brought suit to enjoin the Secretary of State from holding an election under the Rosenberry legislative apportionment. The court held that the Governor had standing to challenge the constitutionality of a reapportionment plan. Further, the reapportionment plan enacted by joint resolution was invalid because legislative districts of Wisconsin could not be apportioned without the joint action of the legislature and the Governor. Further, the Rosenberry apportionment was invalid because it permitted great deviations on either side of a norm representing apportionment in direct ratio to population. The court also concluded that it had the power to adopt a reapportionment plan that conformed to the requirements of Wis. Const. art. IV. It then set a deadline by which a valid apportionment plan was to be adopted and reserved its authority to draft a final plan of apportionment if the legislature and the Governor were unable to adopt a valid plan by the deadline.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city licensed a pinball machine but then sought its forfeiture under the ordinance, which prohibited devices upon whose operation a valuable thing could be staked, won, or lost. The machine allowed players to rollover their high scores, if they paid to play an additional game. The city successfully argued that the transfer of preceding scores to a succeeding game was a &quot;valuable thing&quot; under the ordinance. The corporation appealed and asserted that the machine was not a gambling device, that the city had exceeded the power given to it under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.051, that the city was estopped from bringing the action because it had previously licensed the machine, and that costs were improperly assessed. In modifying the judgment, the court held that the added amusement provided by the transfer of scores was a thing of value and made the machine a prohibited gambling device. The city did not exceed it authority in enacting the ordinance because the enabling statute specifically allowed the city to enact ordinances similar to Wis. Stat. &sect; 945.05. The city was not estopped from enforcing the ordinance, which was enacted pursuant to its police power. Jury costs could not be assessed.</SPAN></P>

The cable company appealed, and the court dismissed the appeals from the orders granting the motion to strike and denying interpleader; such orders were not appealable. The court reversed that part of the order granting a demurrer to the defense that raised the issue of whether the commission held a hearing on the cable company's application to maintain a tower, as required by &sect; 114.135(7). The remaining parts of the order were affirmed. Section 114.135(6), (7) did not deprive the cable company of its property without due process of law and did not deny equal protection. The public safety was involved in protecting navigable airspace, and regulation of the height of structures was appropriate for that purpose. Section 114.135(7) was not so vague and indefinite. The doctrine of laches and estoppel could not be invoked against the commission.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that it was of the opinion that the legislature intended that the Board was to have power to make orders of money notwithstanding the fact that the claimed unfair labor practice arose after the termination of the contract that was allegedly violated. The court found that although the contract had ended, there was not a complete severance of the continuing relationship between the employer and the employees involved in the dispute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner contended that because the determination of necessity was not done by a jury, pursuant to Wis.

The fact that a city served as the Commission's purchasing agent under Wis. Stat. &sect; 84.09(3m) did not serve to make Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2 applicable. The court rejected the landowner's claim that the Commission did not endeavor to acquire the property prior to condemnation because the landowner's attorney had negotiated with the Commission's purchasing agent prior to the action. The court held that the Commission's tender, by a check made payable to the landowner and certain lienholders, satisfied Wis. Stat. &sect; 84.09(2) and was proper. The court held that the landowner was not entitled to an additional award for an old right-of-way because there was no evidence showing that it was discontinued.

The court disagreed. The court found, inter alia, that (1) the statutory word &quot;administered&quot; under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the State Highway Commission of Wisconsin, sought review of a judgment from a circuit court (Wisconsin), which denied the Commission's motion for summary judgment that sought a determination that an acquisition proceeding against respondent property owner was valid and regular and vested title in certain property in the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">There were three actions pending in the circuit court that the owner and the Commission were parties; a valuation action, a validity action, and a trespass action originally brought against respondent wrecking company that the Commission had been interpleaded. The validity action was commenced first and was a direct attack on the validity of the acquisition proceeding. The court concluded that summary judgment was properly denied in the trespass action because the validity of the acquisition proceeding had to be determined in the validity action. The court concluded moreover that all proceedings in the trespass action should have been stayed until the final determination of the validity action. If, as claimed by the owner, the Commission had possession of part of his property outside of the portion described in the award, a proceeding by the state to take title, or inverse condemnation by the owner could afford a remedy with respect to such land unless it was established that the taking violated constitutional restrictions or that for some other reason the state had no power to take it for the purpose for which it was being used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town's appeal presented two questions to the court. The first question was whether the statutory procedure found in Wis.

If the first question was answered in the affirmative, the second question for the court was whether the principle of exclusive remedy was vitiated and rendered inapplicable to the facts of the instant case because the election inspectors had failed to attach to their certification of the election result an affidavit verifying such certification under Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.021(5)(e) (1957). The court held that Wis. Stat. 6.66 (1957) provided the exclusive method for challenging the election result and further held that, since the time for use of such remedy expired even before the city adopted the annexation ordinance in question, the city could not assert in the instant action that the election inspectors' failure to file the affidavit vitiated the certified statement of the inspectors, which was filed with the city clerk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wis. Adm. Code &sect; WCD 11.06(6)(a) created a closed area that included a small public lake and defendant's farm that surrounded the east side of the lake. Section WCD 11.06(6)(a) prohibited hunting in the closed area during Wisconsin's open season on waterfowl. As a result of the closing, waterfowl damaged defendant by foraging on his grain. During the waterfowl open season and while in possession of a hunting license and duck stamp, defendant shot a wild duck on his farm, although the duck was not damaging defendant's property at the time and defendant did not have a Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.596 permit. As a result, defendant was charged with violating Wis. Adm. Code &sect; WCD 11.06(6)(a), and the trial court acquitted him. On appeal, the court affirmed and held as follows: The purpose and effect of &sect; WCD 11.06(6)(a) was to use defendant's farm to support and protect wildfowl for the benefit of all the citizens of Wisconsin. Thus, &sect; WCD 11.06(6)(a) constituted a taking of defendant's property for a public purpose without compensation. Therefore, &sect; WCD violated Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The counties, being quasi-municipal corporations and an arm of the State, had no legal capacity to sue and contest the constitutionality of the statute.

The legislature had previously declared the subject of pensions for certain public employees to be a statewide concern. Although many counties voluntarily joined the Fund, some did not. As such, 1961 Wis. Laws 459 was passed to compel the non-volunteering counties to provide pensions for their employees. The statute was constitutional: It was a public, not a local law; it was not a law for the assessment or collection of taxes and did not create a special method of collecting and returning taxes, it did not constitute a legislative grant of extra compensation to public officers after service or during term, it did not create an indebtedness owed by the counties, and it did not impair contracts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner State, through its state attorney general, brought a petition against respondent commissioner of the state department of administration before the court for a statutory interpretation of Wis. Stat. &sect; 40.53(1) in regard to whether the statute required the state to provide public school bus transportation to private non-public schools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question for statutory interpretation was whether the phrase &quot;on regular routes approved for the public school bus&quot; in &sect; 40.53(1) related back to the word &quot;transportation&quot; or whether it referred to the immediate antecedent phrase having to do with the residence requirement. The court determined that non-public schools operated by religious organizations or sectarian groups were religious seminaries within the meaning of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 18. The court found that to interpret the statute as requiring actual residence on the bus routes would lead to an absurd result, which was to be avoid if possible. The court found that the benefits that parochial schools would receive under &sect; 40.53(1) of free transportation constituted a violation of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 18. The court dismissed the petition, holding that Wis. Stat. &sect; 40.53 was in direct violation of Wis. Const. art. I, &sect; 18, which prohibited the expenditure of any public funds for the benefit of religious societies, or religious or theological seminaries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the State's petition that sought an interpretation of a statute that provided free public transportation to schools because it violated the prohibition of expenditure of public funds for religious societies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent, admittedly not a member of the Wisconsin State Bar, engaged in considerable activity before the Wisconsin Public Service Commission on behalf of clients and was a licensed practitioner before the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Public Service Commission of Indiana. The bar association claimed that respondent was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and sought an injunction restraining his activities. The court reversed the trial court's order dismissing the complaint and entered an injunction against respondent. The court held that the judiciary had the exclusive power to regulate the practice of law in the state, and the alleged lawfulness of respondent to engage in similar activities in other jurisdictions was immaterial. Respondent had been engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, and the court issued an order enjoining him from giving legal advice to clients to inform them of their rights, from preparing for clients documents requiring knowledge of legal principles, and from appearing as an advocate asserting legal rights for clients before public tribunals.</SPAN></P>

The corporation, which was also the employer of the driver of the vehicle, contended that it did not knowingly allow the overweight operation of the vehicle, and that the statute confined liability for the operation to the driver. The court disagreed. The court concluded that the relevant statute had eliminated the word &quot;knowingly&quot;, and that the owner of the vehicle was liable for the actions of the driver as its agent. The court also rejected the corporation's contention that its constitutional rights were violated by the construction of absolute criminal liability on it as the owner and employer, because it had no actual knowledge of the violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The town filed a complaint against the city, alleging that it was circumventing and evading the requirements of Wis. Stat. &sect; 66.021(11)(b) pertaining to annexation of areas of one square mile or more of territory, by employing two separate annexation proceedings to smaller areas. The town complained that if the two regions in question were annexed in a single proceeding, the total land would have exceeded a square mile and necessitated a circuit court review. The city demurred to the complaint and the demurrer was denied. On appeal, the court noted that severance into two separate transactions did not necessarily constitute subterfuge. The court then observed that the motives of the city council in annexation proceedings could not be inquired into where its actions were in accordance with the law. Further, the court explained that &sect; 66.021(11)(b) did not interdict smaller, parallel annexations. Although the annexations were simultaneous, they were supported by different circulators and petition signers. Separate votes of the city council were taken. Because it was the prerogative of the legislature to fix the rules for annexations, the court reversed the order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed orders of a municipal court (Wisconsin), which dismissed actions against defendants one and two charging them with burglary. Defendant three filed a motion to dismiss the State's appeal of the dismissal of the burglary action against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At issue in all three appeals was whether entry of a &quot;public building&quot; (presumably a building owned or used by a public body) was an offense under Wis. Stat. &sect; 943.10, the burglary statute, where the prescribed unlawful intent was present and consent of the person in possession was lacking. The court held that it was error for the trial court to rule that the statute was not applicable to entry of public buildings. Because the dismissals in the cases of defendants one and two were based solely on that ruling, and because there was no challenge to the State's right to appeal under Wis. Stat. &sect; 958.12(1)(a) from the orders made before jeopardy had attached, the orders were reversed by the court. Regarding defendant three, the court found that subjecting him to a second trial by reason of errors in the first trial was not placing him in new and second jeopardy. However, because the inference of intent to steal could not properly be drawn from the evidence with sufficient certainty to overcome the presumption of innocence and to meet the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the judgment of acquittal as to defendant three had to be affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's orders that dismissed the actions against defendants one and two and remanded the causes for further proceedings.

The City argued that plaintiffs were barred from prosecuting the instant action under the rule of election of remedies. The court dismissed the appeal. The court held that parties could not have either by failure to raise the question or by consent conferred jurisdiction upon an appellate court to review an order that was not appealable. The court concluded that an order denying a motion to dismiss was not made appealable by Wis. Stat. &sect; 274.33(3). The court found that while an order denying a motion for summary judgment was appealable, under &sect; 274.33 (3), that the City's motion had not qualified as such a motion. The court further found that an affidavit was required by Wis. Stat. &sect; 270.635(2), and the absence of such an affidavit was fatal to a motion by defendant for summary judgment. The court ruled that the motion to dismiss could not have been treated as equivalent to a demurrer to the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state sought to enforce agricultural rules against an oil company.

The company further contended that Wis. Adm. Code &sect; Ag 112.01, 112.03 conflicted with congressional policy as expressed in the Robinson-Patman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 13. The company alleged that proceedings instituted by the Federal Trade Commission under the Robinson-Patman Act in Virginia precluded the state from also prosecuting for allegedly similar violations in Milwaukee. The circuit court found that the complaint stated facts sufficient to state a cause of action under Wis. Adm. Code &sect; Ag 100.24(3), (4) and Wis. Stat. &sect; 280.02. On appeal, the court determined that the company's allegation of a conflict of federal and state policy was moot because it failed to plead specific facts, and the invalidity of the statute was dependent upon facts other than those of which the court could take judicial notice.

In addition, he argued that no injustice would have resulted from relief and that he had a meritorious defense. The court held that the mistake defendant asserted regarding his failure to answer was of his own making. He was advised of the necessity of filing an answer on several occasions, which he failed for approximately a year to do. The court also rejected his claim that the trial court violated judicial temperament by reminding authorities that under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer's business was the transportation of merchandise by motor truck as a common carrier. The taxpayer was a foreign corporation, but the taxpayer's trucks traveled over half of their miles within the state. The Department required the taxpayer to pay a state income tax, and on appeal, the court affirmed the tax. The court determined that the plain ordinary meaning of the Wis. Stat. &sect;71.01(1) established that the taxpayer's transportation of goods was business transacted within the state. There was no express provision within the tax law that exempted the taxpayer from the income tax. Furthermore, the nondiscriminatory income tax did not violate the commerce clause of the United States Constitution. The income tax was fairly apportioned to local activities within the state. There was no necessity of finding any local activities by the taxpayer other than operating its trucks through the state over state highways. There was nothing in the due process clause of the Fourteenth amendment, which prevented activities in interstate commerce that took place within the state's borders from providing a sufficient nexus to sustain the tax levied on such operations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant railroad appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Milwaukee County (Wisconsin) denying the railroad's motion to dismiss plaintiff's damages action for lack of personal jurisdiction and for forum non conveniens. The railroad argued that its solicitation of business in Wisconsin was insufficient to subject it to jurisdiction of Wisconsin courts and that requiring it to litigate in Wisconsin violated due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The railroad, which was not incorporated in or a resident of Wisconsin, moved to dismiss a personal injury action brought against it in Wisconsin arising from an accident in Wisconsin involving one of its trains. The court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not prohibit a state court from having jurisdiction, even though the railroad's activities in the state were not related to plaintiff's cause of action. Addressing the railroad's arguments that it would be inconvenient for it to litigate the case in Wisconsin, the court held that requiring the railroad to litigate in Wisconsin was not so inconvenient as to deny due process. The expense or inconvenience accruing to the railroad from a trial in Wisconsin did not outweigh that imposed on the plaintiff by a trial elsewhere, and it had not been shown that justice could be better served in a forum other than Wisconsin. If plaintiff had to try his case in some other state, he would have to bear travel expense for his witnesses and would have difficulty producing those witnesses because, unlike the railroad's witnesses, they would not be his employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney general charged that Wis. Admin. Code &sect; 5.04 was an invalid exercise of the board's administrative rule-making power. The attorney general further claimed that &sect; 5.04 exceeded the bounds of correct interpretation of the agency's rule-making authority and constituted an attempted usurpation of the inherent and exclusive power of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. Defendants asserted that &sect; 5.04 was valid and that the board had not usurped the prerogatives of the court. The real questions at issue were (1) whether the completion and use of the standardized forms by brokers in transferring the titles of the real estate of their clients was the practice of law, and (2) if such completion and use was the practice of law, could the board authorize such practice by their licensed brokers. The court concluded that &sect; 5.04 included provisions that permitted the practice of the law by certain nonlawyers to a limited extent and that the regulation of the practice of the law was a judicial power and was vested exclusively in the supreme court. The court upheld the validity of &sect; 5.04 and noted that it continued a practice of laymen that had been permitted throughout the years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction entered by the Municipal Court of Milwaukee County (Wisconsin). The issues included whether he was entitled to a preliminary examination despite the provisions of Wis. Stat. &sect; 955.18(1) (formerly Wis. Stat. &sect; 355.18(1) (1953)), whether that statute denied him equal protection of the laws, and whether the trial judge should have sua sponte instructed the jury as to the effect of his failure to testify.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was extradited from Illinois after which informations were filed charging him and another with armed robbery and first-degree murder. On appeal, the court held that, because he was a fugitive from justice, &sect; 955.18(1) denied him a preliminary hearing. He was not denied equal protection of the law because the process of extradition satisfied the purposes of a preliminary hearing and, after he was extradited, he stood in a different classification than one merely accused of a crime. That classification was reasonable and was not based on residency. Nor had he met his burden of proving that he was not a fugitive from justice in order to overcome the presumption to the contrary arising from the face of the extradition warrant. Although he did not take the stand and his attorney sought no instruction that the failure created no presumption against him, and even though he did not seek a new trial based on the issue, the court considered it and held that the trial court had no obligation to give the instruction without a request. Instructions defendant requested were properly denied as unduly favorable to him. The court declined to grant a new trial in the interest of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">1949 Wis.

Although the court held that the question of whether an exemption denied the equal protection of the laws was, in fact, of great public concern and could be raised by the Department, it denied the Department's motion for rehearing because: (1) the classification made by the legislature in granting a particular tax exemption had to be sustained as not arbitrary or unreasonable if there was any conceivable basis in reason therefor; (2) a conceivable basis for the classification made by the legislature was the reasonable doubt as to whether the exemption would have been constitutional if it had required the refund of taxes already paid because public funds could not be appropriated for a private purpose; and (3) because the taxpayer's deposit with the state treasurer under Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.12(2) of the amount of the gift taxes sought to be collected was in effect one in escrow, it did not constitute public funds and a refund of a part thereof was not an expenditure of public funds for a private purpose.</SPAN></P>

That candidate did not take his oath of office as a legislator until five days after the final assembly vote. The bank asserted that &sect; 221.04 (1) (f), prohibiting the establishment of a branch, was invalid. The court affirmed the circuit court's decision. The court found that under &sect; 221.04, the candidate was an assemblyman-elect until the day he took his oath of office. It was not an unlawful discrimination or an illegal classification so as to constitute a denial of the equal protection. The court determined that the legislature had a basis, in finding that further bank branches should not be allowed due to threats of undue concentration and monopoly in banking. Thus, branch banking for previously existing locations did not violate equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wis. Stat. &sect; 72.79(1) (1949) exempted from the gift tax any transfer of property to any corporation that operated principally in Wisconsin and that was organized for charitable purposes no part of the net income of which inured to the benefit of any private stockholder or individual. Under &sect; 72.79(1), a corporation was operating for a particular year principally within Wisconsin where 50 percent or more of its funds for a specified period had been used, inter alia, within Wisconsin for the purposes of its organization. The Department argued that the only way to be operating in Wisconsin under &sect; 72.79(1) was to pass the 50-percent test. The court held that the 50-percent test was not exclusive. It ruled that the election of directors and officers, adoption of by-laws, and receiving and keeping of the gifts from the couple were activities of the foundation; as all of those acts were done in Wisconsin, the foundation ipso facto had been operating principally in Wisconsin. The court also ruled, inter alia, that application of the retroactive exception of Wis. Stat. &sect; 72.79(1) (1949) to the 1948 transfers at issue was not an expenditure of public funds for a private purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A railway company filed an application with the commission that sought to abolish agency positions at its stations. A hearing was scheduled and notices were posted. The commission authorized the abolishment of several of the agency positions because of the railway company's adverse financial conditions.

Stat. &sect; 227.19 (1) for leave to remand the record in the proceeding to the commission for further evidence. The court held that the trial court afforded a full and fair hearing to all parties where Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 195.01 (10) and 192.56 were complied with, all notices were given as required, no notice to certain communities was necessary, and no witnesses were seriously inconvenience. The court found that the commission's findings were supported by substantial evidence where there was no contradiction of the fact that the railroad was in a critical financial condition. The court held that pursuant to Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff real estate developer appealed from an order of the Circuit Court of Dane County (Wisconsin), which sustained a demurrer made by defendant Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin and affiliated corporations (Board), dismissing the developer's complaint. The developer argued that the state was a necessary party and could be made a party under Wis. Stat. &sect; 262.10, even though it was immune from suit absent consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The real estate developer sued the Board to set aside the Board's sale of land that was designated for development into a shopping center. The real estate was exclusively owned by the Board. The developer argued that the state was a necessary party for a proper determination of the rights of the parties. The court affirmed the order of the trial court which sustained the Board's demurrer and dismissed the action. The court held that the state had no interest per se in the real estate that formed the basis of the lawsuit. The state was not a necessary party to the conveyance and, therefore, it was not a party to an action to compel the cancellation of the conveyance. No public property was taken for private use. The land was sold for considerations that seemed to the board in its discretion as adequate, and the money that was given to one of the corporations was properly used for the benefit of the university within the discretion and best judgment of the Board. In short, the court found no abuse of discretion by the Board in arranging the financial transaction in such a way that the best interests of the university were protected.</SPAN></P>

The question was whether the expense for the governor's study commission, sought to be charged to the state teachers' retirement fund by 1955 Wis. Laws ch. 477, was a proper expense of the retirement system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Director claimed that the Board was required to pay out funds according to law and appropriations from the earnings of the fund had been made by law each year; therefore, there was no vested right in the gross earnings of the fund. The Board disagreed and the trial court ruled in favor of the Board's decision. On appeal, the court held that the teachers had a contractual relationship with the state and a vested right in the state teachers' retirement system. The earnings on investments, part of which represented contributions made by the teachers and the state under the contract, constituted assets of the system. Thus, the reserve for contingencies set up by the Board was a part of the system. The court concluded that the cost of adequately informing the legislature and the governor so that they could intelligently perform their duties was not a proper expense of the teachers' retirement fund. The expenses of the governor's study commission were paid out of the general fund. Under Wis. Stat. &sect; 990.001(11), that part of 1955 Wis. Laws ch. 477 relating to the appropriation of funds from the state teachers' retirement fund was severable from the rest of the act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Department of Taxation sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for La Crosse County (Wisconsin) sustaining a judgment of the board of tax appeals, which found that appellee city was entitled to a tax abatement on a trust that was permanently set aside for the city. The trial court found that the trust was not taxable, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 71.08(9) (1947).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The will of decedent provided for an annuity to be paid to her brother during his lifetime and the remainder of the decedent's estate to be bequeathed to the city. The decedent's trustees sought a judgment against the department that the balance of the trust, not including the annuity, was exempt from income taxes. After the claim was denied, &sect; 71.08(9) was amended. The trustees filed a claim for refund for the taxes paid on the trust, which the department denied. The board reversed the department and directed the abatement of the additional assessment. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 71.08(9) exempted from taxation the income of the trust over and above the annuity. There was little merit in a contention that a refund constituted an illegal and unconstitutional use of public funds for a private purpose. The department did not suggest that the trust assessment, and consequently the tax payment, became final and conclusive. As long as the assessment was not yet final and conclusive, the statutory provisions for refund were available to the city without a constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Insured operated a farming business and an unrelated commercial business. Insurer issued to insured a general liability insurance policy that excluded coverage for bodily injury sustained by anyone while engaged in insured's employment. Insured's employee performed various agricultural and commercial jobs for insured. Employee was injured while cutting wood on defendant's property that was specifically excluded from farming operations. When employee brought suit against insured for his injuries, insurer instituted a declaratory action seeking a determination of is obligations under the policy. The trial court ruled that employee was neither a commercial nor agricultural employee at the time of the accident, and was therefore accorded coverage. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that under the facts presented, employee was in a fact an employee of insured at the time of the accident and coverage under the policy was clearly and unambiguously excluded by the terms of insurer's policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporations manufactured and sold bituminous fiber sewer pipe. In an attempt to prevent or cure excessive water pollution, the government officials enacted a rule which required sewers to be made of extra-heavy cast-iron soil pipe with hot poured lead joints.

The trial court held that the rule was arbitrary and unreasonable because it required the use of cast-iron pipe in soil conditions where such pipe was not suitable and it prohibited the sale of a suitable product manufactured by the corporations which was equal or superior to cast-iron pipe. The court held that (1) the government officials' failure to provide for exceptions to the rule where soil conditions warranted the use of a material other than cast-iron pipe rendered the rule unconstitutional; and (2) despite the government officials' contention to the contrary, the corporations did show that enforcement of the rule would interfere with and impair their legal rights and privileges because it banned their product in a large and growing metropolitan area and it impaired the future operation and expansion of their businesses.</SPAN></P>

Although the employee did not suffer a wage loss, he contended he was entitled to compensation because he could have been allowed compensation if he filed his application on June 30, 1953, the day before 1953 Wis.

Stat. &sect; 52.01(4) was unconstitutional. The relative also claimed that &sect; 52.01(4) denied him equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The relative claimed that &sect; 52.01(4) was void for uncertainty because it required a court to speculate as to care and protection in old age, and whether parents supported a child according to law. The court opined that, while the future contained uncertainties, that circumstance did not vitiate the statute, which provided for modification upon the application of any affected party. The court held that the existence of material facts, which were reasonably certain at the time of the order, was all the factual certainty that was required. The relative's equal protection claim was based on the contention that the trial court could require one relative to provide the whole support even if there were relatives equally responsible and able to pay. The court held that the relative had the opportunity under the statute to show that other persons were equally or better able to pay, and that the court had the power to apportion the responsibility among relatives. Further, the relative had a right to recover contribution from a refusing relative. Finally, the court admonished the welfare director for copying the attorney general's name and brief from another case without permission.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained a demurrer to the companies' complaint seeking an injunction against defendants' actions. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the transportation of passengers for hire in a taxicab upon the streets was not an inherent right, but a privilege with the city, in the exercise of its discretion. Milwaukee county had the power to pass ordinances and promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the proper exercise of governmental functions in connection with the airport, but Milwaukee, WI Code of Ordinances &sect; 100.54 applied because it did not interfere with any ordinance of Milwaukee county acting as a quasi-corporation.

Appellants argued that the amount of the award was grossly inadequate to compensate for the minor's injuries.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner's German Shepherd dog escaped. The dog was raised with children and was believed to be friendly. The next day, while the dog was still on the loose, it ran up onto a porch where the minor was playing. The minor played with the dog. The dog subsequently saw a smaller dog in the house and behind a screen door. The dog jumped up on its hind legs with its front paws against the door. The lady inside the house said something that made the minor believe she wanted the German Shepherd to back down and, apparently in response, he grabbed the dog from behind. He was severely bitten in the face. Appellants filed their action. They appealed because of what the considered a grossly small award. The court noted that the State's comparative negligence statute had not been applied to a dog-bite case as yet. Wis. Stat. &sect; 174.02 did not impose a new, absolute liability against dog owners that made the comparative negligence statute inapplicable because the theory of recovery was not based on negligence. Rather, the statute merely eliminated the necessity of proving scienter. A new trial was required and appellants were to be afforded the opportunity to amend their complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner landowners appealed the judgment of a circuit court (Wisconsin), which denied their request for detachment, pursuant to Wis. Stat. &sect; 62.075, of areas of land from respondent Village of Twin Lakes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowners petitioned for detachment of areas one through four. Only area one contained 200 acres or more. The petition foundered in the circuit court because areas three and four were separated from each other and areas one and two and did not contain 200 acres and because area two did not contain 200 acres and was separated from area one. The court on review held that the circuit court correctly construed &sect; 62.075 to deny detachment because its legislative history suggested that ambiguities were not to be construed in favor of detachment and its language in &sect; 62.075(3) suggested that detachment could only consist of a continuos area of 200 acres or more. The court held that two pieces of land, which were separated from each other by land within the corporate limits and did not have 200 acres if taken separately, could not be detached even though they otherwise met the standards of &sect; 62.075. The court agreed that detaching areas one and two violated the requirement that detachment leave the Village reasonably compact and the boundaries substantially regular because it would have left a long, narrow strip of right of way within the corporate limits of the Village.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment for the Village and against the landowners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant brought an action challenging the propriety of an agreement entered into between the State Conservation Commission of Wisconsin and a corporation for the lease of public land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation leased the property at issue for the purpose of building a television communication tower. Under the agreement, all communications facilities on the property would be transferred to the one tower. Appellant argued that the lease was in violation of Wis. Const. art. XI, &sect;3a, because that provision restricted the power of the legislature to authorize a lease of state park lands and that such restrictions, in particular, the lease of the land for park purposes, had not been complied with. The court held that the small amount of land involved did not interfere with the enjoyment of the park by the public and noted that a radio tower already existed on the property. The court pointed out that nothing in Wis. Stat. &sect; 27.01(2)(g), which granted the leasing power to the Commission, restricted the leasing power to park purposes. The court noted the benefits to the public derived from the lease, which included improved television reception to residents and improved police radio communications. With respect to the adequacy of consideration for the lease, the court held that this involved a disputed issue of fact that could not be disposed of by affidavit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Wis. Const. art. 11, &sect; 3 was enacted to limit debt incurred by municipal authorities. It was later interpreted not to include debts which were short term and payable by tax revenues which were in the process of collection. The school district had, in its budget, an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest due on its proposed loan; the tax levy included such amount, as did the tax roll held by the city treasurer. Wis. Stat. &sect; 67.12(8a) dealt with short term loans required for current operating expenses of a school district and payable out of revenues to which the district was entitled at the time the loans were made. The court held that &sect; 67.12(8a) was valid and that such indebtedness was not to be considered in computing the amount of indebtedness allowed a school district under Wis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature passed Wis. Stat. &sect; 59.031 (1959), which gave the county executive of the largest counties the power to appointment without approval of the board of supervisors, &sect; 59.031(2)(b), and the power to veto increases or decreases in the budget, &sect; 59.031(5), and to approve or veto resolutions or ordinances, &sect; 59.031(6). The constitutionality of the statute was challenged. The court overruled the demurrer, denied the motion to quash and granted the peremptory writ of mandamus. The court ruled unconstitutional the provisions granting the appointment powers and the powers to veto or approve budget changes and resolutions and ordinances. The court determined that Wis. Const. art. IV, &sect; 23 mandated that the legislature establish one system of town and county government, that Wis. Stat. &sect;&sect; 59.031(2)(b), (5), and (6) (1959) created a system of checks and balances differing fundamentally from the system in the other counties, but that those provisions were severable from the rest of the statute leaving a viable statute, pursuant to &sect; 990.001(11).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dairy companies gave aids to retailers, which included furnishing them with ice cream cabinets. The retailers then shifted their business to the companies. The legislature enacted regulatory measures that banned these types of marketing practices.

The trial court found that the marketing practices did not have a tendency to monopolize wholesale commerce or reduce competition. Thus, the trial court declared the regulatory measures unconstitutional. The State appealed. The court reversed, holding that the prohibitory and regulatory methods in the legislation were not inappropriate. The court reasoned that the legislation was enacted in promotion of the public welfare and that the companies' marketing practices were incompatible with the public welfare. Therefore, the legislation was capable of constitutional administration and enforcement.</SPAN></P>

Nothing in the affirmative requirements of the ordinance warranted a holding that it was unreasonable. The court found no denial of due process in the threatened application of the enforcement procedures of the ordinance to the property owners or their property. The practical effect of the part of the ordinance that authorized the city's commissioner of health to condemn a building as unfit for human habitation was to declare such building to be a public nuisance.</SPAN></P>
