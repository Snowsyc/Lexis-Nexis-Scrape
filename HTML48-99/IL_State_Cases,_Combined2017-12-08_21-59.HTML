</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant newspaper sought review of a decision of the Circuit Court of Iroquois County (Illinois), which denied its request to vacate an order that prevented it from publishing the name of a juvenile that was accused of murder and banned it from the courtroom for future proceedings in the matter pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 701-20(6) (1985). Appellee, the state attorney general, responded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the newspaper contended that the trial court's orders were unconstitutional because they violated its First Amendment right to publish information that had already entered the public domain and that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 701-20(6) (1985) was unconstitutional on its face and as applied by the trial court. The attorney general filed motions to dismiss the newspaper's appeal for want of jurisdiction and for failure to file a complete record on appeal. Those motions were taken with the appeal. Specifically, the attorney general argued that the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the instant appeal under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 307(a)(1), 107 Ill.2d.R. 307(a)(1), because the matter was not an injunctive action in any way, shape, or form. The attorney general contended that the trial court's order to the press not to use the name of the minor in reporting on the court hearing was strictly administrative in nature and designed to protect the minor's safety. The court agreed. The substance of the orders were administrative in nature and derived from the inherent authority of the trial court to control the proceedings and, thus, ancillary to the Juvenile Court Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the newspaper's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a minor who had refused blood transfusions on the ground that it violated her religious beliefs, appealed from the order of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which found, in appellee state's suit under the Juvenile Court Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 701--1 et seq., that she was medically neglected and, while finding that she was mature and had arrived at her decision independently, adjudged her a ward of the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the finding of medical neglect did not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 23, para. 2051 et seq. (1985), excepted certain religion-based refusals of medical treatment from the class of cases physicians were required to report as constituting neglect. However, there was no such exception in the Juvenile Court Act. Since no member of any other faith would have been entitled to an exemption from a finding of medical neglect under the Juvenile Court Act simply because of his religious beliefs, there was no equal protection violation. Further, the Juvenile Court Act did not violate the minor's free exercise rights under the First Amendment because the state had a significant interest in protecting immature minors. However, the trial court found that the minor had made a mature decision to follow her religious beliefs. This finding obviated any state interest in protecting immature minors. In the absence of such an interest, the minor could not be prevented from exercising a constitutional right solely because of her minority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's order appointing a temporary custodian for the minor. It ordered the minor to be partially emancipated, and granted her the right to accept or refuse transfusions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of aggravated kidnapping and unlawful restraint. He was sentenced in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) on the aggravated kidnapping charge to an extended term of imprisonment of 30 years. He appealed his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant grabbed a 10-year-old child, and proceeded to take her through alleys and down a street, until she yelled for held and ran off. In reversing defendant's conviction for aggravated kidnapping, the court held that &quot;secret confinement&quot; the gist of kidnapping, had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Since the victim simply was not confined or enclosed within any place or any thing and at no time was the victim &quot;concealed, hidden, or not made public&quot; during the entire incident, the state failed to prove that the victim was &quot;secretly confined.&quot; Defendant's conviction for aggravated kidnapping had to be reversed. In light of strong similarities between the two offenses, evidence of a similar crime was properly admitted when the jury was instructed that the evidence was received solely on the issue of the defendant's identification, intent, motive, and design. It was not necessary to conduct a mini-trial of the prior incident in order to establish sufficient acts from which defendant's identity, intent and motive and design in the incident might be inferred, and for the sake of economy of judicial time, the court advised against such detailed evidence of other offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's conviction for aggravated kidnapping and the cause was remanded to the trial court for resentencing on the unlawful restraint conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer purchased four magazines from defendant's store. The trial court convicted defendant of four counts of obscenity. Defendant argued on appeal that the Illinois obscenity statute was unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, and overbroad. He further argued that the trial court erred in prohibiting defendant from asking a question on voir dire about the jurors' beliefs on obscenity, in refusing to admit into evidence adult use ordinances from other communities within Illinois, and in failing to give to two of defendant's proposed jury instructions. The court affirmed. The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20(b) (1985), as amended, followed the federal obscenity guidelines and was not unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, or overbroad. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing defendant's proposed voir dire question because the question was aimed at indoctrinating the jury into believing that the regulation of obscenity was comparable to regulating a citizen's entry of adult bookstores. The ordinances were properly excluded because they did not constitute evidence of the statewide community standard for sexually explicit material.</SPAN></P>

Stat. 5/2-103 limited venue to the county in which its principal office was located, with the exception that in actions to recover damages to real estate venue could have been in the county where the real estate was located. The court found that the city requested equitable relief and did not seek to recover damages to real estate. The court held that the action had to be brought in Du Page County, the county in which the municipal corporation had its principal office, because there were no exceptions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to sentencing, petitioner filed a pro se motion to have his court-appointed attorney replaced. Petitioner argued that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal. The trial court appointed counsel to represent petitioner. The court-appointed counsel later filed a motion to withdraw, stating that he had found no constitutional issues suitable for post-conviction relief. Following a hearing on counsel's petition, the trial court allowed the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Petitioner's allegation regarding the trial court's refusal to rule on a motion in limine was barred by the doctrine of res judicata, and his allegations concerning ineffective assistance of counsel were not supported by a clear and substantial showing. Thus, the trial court correctly determined that petitioner had not shown that his allegations of error rose to a constitutional level; thus, an evidentiary hearing was not warranted. The trial court properly allowed the counsel's motion to withdraw. Also, it was not error to assign the petition to a judge other than the one who presided over his trial.</SPAN></P>

The voters appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that one's party affiliation did not constitute a privacy right under Ill. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6. The prohibition against disclosing matters of a personal nature properly referred to the type of information contained in banking records and collected by credit associations, income tax services, and investigative institutions. The only public declaration that a voter was called upon to make was to choose which party primary to participate in. The imposition on the voter was minimal.

After a hearing, the trial court overruled the suppression motion. The trial court convicted defendant for murder. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in not suppressing his post-indictment lineup, the evidence did not prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and the mandatory life sentence was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that, although defendant was denied his constitutional rights and the trial judge misconstrued defendant's argument, the in-court identification had an independent source, and the lineup violation was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court held that the defendant's convictions for conspiracy and solicitation had to be vacated. The court noted that &sect; 8-5 of the Criminal Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 8-5 (1979), provided that no person was to be convicted of both the inchoate and the principal offense, and the committee comments to that section clearly stated that the provision applied to conspiracy and solicitation.

The court held that the trial judge had not rendered legally inconsistent verdicts.

The court held that the victim's preliminary hearing testimony satisfied the statutory requirements for admissibility as direct evidence at trial because it conflicted with her trial testimony, she was subject to cross-examination on her prior statements, and the prior statements were made under oath. The court found no conflict between Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 238, 87 Ill. 2d 238, and Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, &sect; 115-10.1 (1985) that rendered the latter unconstitutional. The court held that the testimony of a nurse was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule because the statements were made for the purpose of medical treatment and diagnosis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employer applied for revision of its benefit wages statement sent from the state Department of Employment Security and requested cancellation of certain charges. A hearing was held on the matter, but the state refused to cancel some charges. The employer sought judicial review, and the lower court determined that the charges should be cancelled. The employer moved for an award of expenses and attorney fees, but the motion was denied. The Department of Employment Security appealed the judgment of the lower court, and the employer cross-appealed the denial of his motion for expenses and attorney fees. On review, the court interpreted &sect; 1508 of the Unemployment Insurance Act, Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was charged with deviate sexual assault and aggravated kidnapping, he was assigned to a psychiatric unit. His attorney failed to obtain psychiatric records for use at a competency hearing and at trial. Defendant was convicted after a bench trial, and he appealed. The court reversed, holding that defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel because defendant's assignment to the psychiatric unit, coupled with other circumstances of the case, imposed a duty to investigate and discover the records. Due to the attorney's failure to investigate, the outcome of the fitness hearing was compromised and defendant did not assert an insanity defense at trial. The trial court did not abuse its discretion during the fitness hearing by finding the prosecution's witness more credible, but it did err by contravening Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 104 --11(c) and imposing the burden of proving competency on defendant. The trial court did abuse its discretion by its finding on the day of trial that defendant was fit to stand trial when that finding was based on the court's own observation and lack of suggestion by defense counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the finding that defendant was fit to stand trial and the judgment of conviction. The cause was remanded for a new fitness hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court found that even if the issue was properly preserved for appeal, the legislative procedure was properly adhered to in passing the amendment. Defendant also alleged that his sentence of life imprisonment must have been reversed because the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of two prior convictions that contained the elements of a Class X felony as required by the Act.

The court held that because defendant failed to raise, in his motion to withdraw his pleas, the issue of the adequacy of the trial court's admonitions, the issue was deemed waived. The court further held that the prosecutor's recitation of the offenses in the language of the charges did establish that defendant committed acts constituting the offenses, so a factual basis for defendant's guilty pleas was established. The court also held that defendant had waived his right to challenge the voluntariness of his confession, which formed the basis of his guilty pleas.

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the building that defendant invaded was a dwelling as defined by state law, in that it was used and intended to be used as a home and residence. Defendant also claimed that the State failed to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt where the in-court identifications of defendant were unconstitutionally unreliable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homebuyer purchased a new home from the builder that allegedly contained structural damages when built. The trial court found that the breach was wilful and wanton and awarded punitive damages. On appeal, the majority made it clear that there must be actual physical injury or actual damage to property to recover under a tort theory. Neither physical injury nor actual damage was proved. Where the construction defects did not cause physical injuries or damage to other property, tort liability could not be imposed on a builder for a breach of contract. Further, the essence of the implied warranties was that the builder was responsible for correcting any defects. Here, the builder was not allowed to respond to his obligation because he was not given an opportunity to correct the problem. The evidence was insufficient to support the trial court's decision to incorporate the corrections of the problems with the air-conditioning system into the judgment. On cross-appeal, an action for conversion was not the appropriate method of obtaining title to real property alleged to be wrongfully held pursuant to a contract provision.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that he was denied a fair trial by repeated references to his arrest record. The State argued that because defendant made no objection to the testimony at issue and raised no issue concerning it in his post-trial motion, his assertion of error was considered waived unless it constituted plain error under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 615(a). The court agreed that the issue had been waived and concluded that the plain error exception to the waiver rule was not applicable. Next, defendant argued that the sentence imposed was arbitrary and capricious because the more serious offense of theft of a motor vehicle carried a lesser penalty. The court found the issue was waived because it was raised for the first time on appeal. The court also found the argument was without merit. The court examined the legislative history and concluded that the three-year sentence imposed under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4-103(b) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court entered an order dismissing the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. On appeal, the court affirmed the order, holding that (1) because the legislature had broad power to regulate municipal boundaries, the residents could not assert an infringement of a fundamental right, and the state was not required to show a compelling state interest in justifying the consent requirement of Ill.

She was found guilty but mentally ill of two counts and was sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal she questioned, inter alia, whether the evidence established that she was legally sane when she committed the offenses. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that there was a presumption that all persons were sane, and in order to raise the affirmative defense of insanity, defendant had to prove insanity at the time of the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 3-2(b), 6-2(e) (1985). The trial court specifically found the experts' opinions less credible than the lay witness evidence on sanity, listing its reasons, before determining that she did not sustain her burden. Although defendant was depressed, she knew her conduct was wrong and refused to conform her conduct to the requirements of the law. Defendant did not have a history of mental disease, nor did she exhibit qualities of an insane person to those who came in contact with her daily before the incident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant and a co-defendant were convicted of murder, armed robbery, and attempted murder. The defendant filed a post-conviction petition for relief, contending that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial because the same attorney represented both him and a co-defendant when their defenses were inconsistent and antagonistic and that the defendant's trial attorney had a conflict of interest. On appeal, the court reversed, remanded with instructions, and held that it was necessary to remand the cause for an evidentiary hearing on the constitutional issue as to whether the defendant received effective assistance of counsel at trial. There was a possible conflict of interest in the joint representation at trial. By making an Anders motion to withdraw, defendant's appellate counsel did not raise the questions of severance or conflict of interest. At the defendant's post-conviction hearing, the defendant's counsel did not argue the possible ineffectiveness of either the trial or appellate counsel. The defendant's trial counsel asserted that he could not adequately cross-examine witnesses and that the state employed a guilt by association strategy.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further argued that the trial court erred by allowing the state's motion, pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 413(a)(vii), for the taking of hair, blood, and saliva samples from him without complying with constitutional requirements. The court held that the jury selection did not violate defendant's constitutional rights because defendant was not black and was, therefore, not a member of a cognizable racial group that was discriminated against by the state's peremptory challenges. The court found that the use of peremptory challenges to exclude jurors under the age of 30 did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VI because people under the age of 30 did not qualify as a distinctive group.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of a stolen motor vehicle pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4-103 (1985) and was sentenced to a certain term of imprisonment. On review, defendant argued that because possession of a stolen motor vehicle was a lesser included offense of theft of a motor vehicle, it was unconstitutional for the former to be punishable more severely than the latter. The court found that the amendment to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 4-103 (1985), by imposing a more severe penalty for possession of a stolen motor vehicle than that imposed for felony theft, demonstrated a legislative intent that possession of a stolen motor vehicle be considered as a separate, more serious offense and not as a lesser included offense of theft. It was reasoned that the legislature could properly make such an evaluation. Thus, the court concluded that defendant's argument that the statute provided a disproportionately more serious sentence for a lesser included offense than provided for the greater offense was without merit.</SPAN></P>

Over the next two years, the parties engaged in extensive discovery. Beginning in July 1986, the circuit court issued several discovery rulings adverse to plaintiffs, and it denied the hospital's summary judgment motion. The case was set for trial in late 1986. Two years after filing suit, plaintiffs filed a motion for voluntary dismissal pursuant to &sect; 2-1009 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-1009 (1985). At that time, no motions to dismiss or motions for summary judgment were pending. Defendants objected to the motion, but the circuit court held that it had no discretion under &sect; 2-1009 and dismissed without prejudice. Defendants appealed, claiming that &sect; 2-1009 was unconstitutional because it amounted to an impermissible infringement on the exclusive authority of the judiciary to administer the courts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a car accident. When police arrived, they found that defendant smelled of alcohol. Defendant was placed under arrest for driving under the influence. Defendant refused to take a breath test. Defendant therefore received a statutory summary suspension of his driver's license. The lower court found the requirements of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 2-118.1(b) (1985) relative to implied consent had been met and denied defendant's motion to rescind. Defendant argued on appeal that the suspension had to be rescinded for failure to hold the implied-consent hearing within the statutorily mandated 30 days. The court agreed and reversed. The 30-day time period was mandatory under para. 2-118.1(b). This time period was the legislature's determination of what constituted a prompt hearing for due process requirements. Failure to hold the hearing within the required 30 days violated defendant's due process rights. The only appropriate remedy was to require the rescission of his suspension. The court held that para. 2-118.1(b) was constitutional and that it was not applicable to the lower court's power to stay pending appeal from a para. 2-118.1 hearing order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant leased the bottom floor of a building, out of which he ran a grocery store. Defendant with co-defendant present told the witness his plan to burn down his store and offered the witness money to act as a lookout. On the night in question, defendant again offered the witness money to act as a lookout and told the witness to call him to wake him up and after the call, to open the side burglar gates on the store. The witness informed the arson unit of what was to occur. Upon review, the court found that the facts indicated defendants intended to attempt to commit arson beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the evidence indicated that defendants had a conspiratorial agreement to commit arson. The failure of the State to disclose a letter that recommended an award for the witness because he provided the police information that led to defendants' arrest was not a violation of the Brady rule. It did not deprive defendants of a fair trial and the witness was cross-examined at length about the possibility of receiving an award at trial. The court agreed that defendants' convictions for aggravated arson had to be reversed because the aggravated arson statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, a firefighter, was granted a disability pension in 1973. At the time, he was 47 years old and had over 21 years of active service. The employee elected to permanently retire from the fire department on January 1, 1982. The board ruled that the employee would be paid a pension based on the salary of a firefighter of his rank in 1973, the year he went on disability, rather than 1982, the year of his retirement. The employee sought review by the trial court, which ruled that the employee was entitled to receive his pension based on the salary of a firefighter of his rank at the time of his permanent retirement. The board sought review and the court affirmed. The court noted that the version of the Illinois Pension Act in effect at the time the action was commenced stated that the pension was to be computed based on the rank held by the employee on the date of his election to retire, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 4-113 (1985). The court rejected the board's claim that this section did not apply because the employee was not &quot;in service&quot; as of his retirement date, ruling that a firefighter who received disability benefits should be considered an in-service employee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that plaintiff husband could not separate a claim for loss of material services from a claim for loss of consortium in decedent's wrongful death action. The court concluded that it was reversible error to allow evidence of the quality of the husband's marriage to the decedent (material services) because the husband withdrew his claim for loss of consortium; therefore, this evidence was irrelevant to the issue of the amount of damages. Furthermore, the court found that evidence of his remarriage would have been properly admissible to limit his recovery for lost material services to actual loss. The court found that the failure to adequately apprise the jury of the fact of the husband's remarriage and the identity of his new spouse necessitated a new trial. The court found that to allow the mothers of illegitimate children to recover for their wrongful deaths while denying that right to their fathers constituted invidious gender-based discrimination that denied the equal protection of the laws. U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 (1970). Thus, the court found that the father was entitled to recover for his illegitimate son's death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff decedent's widow appealed a decision from the Circuit Court of McLean County (Illinois), which held her in contempt for her failure to produce a list of witnesses before the trial of her wrongful death claim against defendant asbestos manufacturer. The widow argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-1003(c) (1985) protected such matters from disclosure and that the list was privileged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widow filed a wrongful death action against the asbestos manufacturer. The circuit court ordered the widow to file a list of witnesses, including names and addresses, for use in voir dire. The circuit court also ordered that the list would be binding on the parties' presentations at trial. When the widow refused to comply, the circuit court held her in contempt, imposed a fine, and held that the trial would not proceed until the list was furnished. On appeal, the widow argued that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-1003(c) (1985) provided that a party was not required to produce the names or addresses of witnesses. She also cited Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 201(b)(2), which provided that matters privileged at trial were also privileged during discovery, 87 Ill. 2d R. 201(b)(2). The court held that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-1003(c) (1985) applied only to discovery, not to trials. Moreover, a witness list was not &quot;work product&quot; privileged during discovery or at trial. Although the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in holding the widow in contempt, its order constituted an abuse of discretion because its scope was overbroad. The court vacated the order and remanded.</SPAN></P>

However, the court also held that the circuit court abused its discretion when it ordered that the widow could not call any witnesses not listed nor out of the listed order without its permission. The court vacated the contempt order and remanded the action.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the obscenity conviction, vacated the sentence, and remanded the cause for a new trial. The trial court erred in instructing the jury to use a state community standard in considering the magazines' value. The erroneous instruction was not harmless error because a rational juror, if properly instructed, could have accepted the expert witness' testimony and concluded that the materials had some limited value, either as an aid in achieving marital balance or as a safety valve to prevent criminal behavior. The jury instruction may have prompted the jury to discount the expert testimony and determine that the materials had value to the scientific community but no value to the jurors' community. The evidence failed to establish defendant possessed a book sold by another employee. The court rejected defendant's contention that the materials depicting ultimate sex acts, lewd exhibition of the genitals, and sexual violence were not obscene as a matter of law. In sentencing defendant, the trial court's creation of a class of disfavored offenders, adult bookstore employees, was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court abused its discretion during voir dire and that it erred by not appointing independent counsel for his pro se motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court rejected both of defendant's contentions and affirmed the conviction. First, the court held that the trial court properly refused to ask prospective jurors whether they would be prejudiced against defendant because of his prior felony convictions. The proffered question was clearly covered by the jury instruction on the limitation of felony convictions in Ill. Pattern Jury Instructions, Crim. No. 3.13 (2d ed.), which was given to the jury at the end of the case. Second, the court held that defendant was not entitled to a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel because 1) defendant waived his claim to ineffective assistance of counsel pursuant to Ill. Code of Crim. P. &sect; 116 -1, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 116 -1 (1985), 2) the allegations were unsworn, and 3) regardless, it was not manifestly erroneous for the trial court to determine that defendant's claim was spurious and to refuse to appoint new counsel for defendant's pro se motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The association brought a declaratory judgment action concerning installation of cable television equipment by the cable company. The trial court issued a preliminary injunction restraining the cable company from installing cable television equipment on the association's property. The trial court predicated the preliminary injunction on a finding that the Illinois Cable Access Statute (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para 11--42--11.1 (1985), failed to provide adequate safeguards for the taking of private property prior to compensation and that the statute constituted an unconstitutional taking of private property for private use. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court's finding was overly broad and if allowed to stand, could have affected the validity of other Illinois municipal franchises. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of the statute, but based its holding on the preliminary determination that the purpose of the proposed taking was a public rather than the private.</SPAN></P>

The retiree cross-appealed the termination of his benefits after his conviction of a job-related felony, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 13 -- 221 (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retiree received benefits for years. The board summarily terminated the benefits upon conviction. On appeal, the court held that the trial court only had jurisdiction over the questions of law and of fact presented by the administrative record, and no new or additional issues could be framed by the pleadings, so that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 3 -- 110 (1985) precluded the trial court from considering the issues of a refund or setoff. The court held that the felony forfeiture statute served a valid public purpose by discouraging job-related criminal conduct by public employees and held that any contractual rights of the retiree, who began his employment after the statute was effective, were subject to the statute. The court then held that the retiree had a constitutionally protected property interest in his benefits, so that due process required that he be given reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the termination. The court found that due process did not require a full plenary hearing and that the board could receive a copy of the conviction as prima facie evidence, but held that the retiree must be given an opportunity to raise relevant issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the motion of defendant lenders, the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) certified two questions for appeal after the trial court denied the lenders' motion to dismiss a usury suit filed by plaintiff borrower.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A borrower obtained two loans, each from a different lender, at interest rates of 17.99 percent and 12.49 percent respectively. Both loans were secured by a second mortgage on the borrower's residence. The borrower filed usury claims against the lenders, who filed a motion to dismiss. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. The court reversed and remanded for an order granting the lenders' motion to dismiss. The court rejected the borrower's argument that the unlawfulness of a loan had to be determined by the applicable law at the time the loan was made. There was no usury in the absence of a law limiting the rate of interest, and a particular rate of interest was illegal only if it exceeded the statutory limit applicable in the particular case. The borrower in fact was simply seeking a windfall, rather than protection from a usurious loan. The court thus applied the rule that the right to a remedy should be determined on the basis of the law at the time the suit was brought and judgment rendered. At the time the borrower filed suit, the state legislature had amended the Interest Act to exclude from the usury statute all loans secured by real estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that denied the lenders' motion to dismiss, and the court remanded for the entry of an order granting the lenders' motion to dismiss a borrower's usury action. Because the court's answer to the first certified question disposed of the appeal, the court did not reach the second question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief when the county denied plaintiffs the requested zoning relief for the development of a sanitary landfill. Plaintiffs appealed from the trial court's findings that state law did not preempt the county's zoning authority as a home rule unit, and that the county was not estopped from exercising its zoning authority. The court found no express preemption in the Reclamation Act enacted under Ill. Const. Art. VII, &sect; 6 (1970), so as to limit or deny the power of a home rule unit. The held that there was concurrent jurisdiction over sanitary landfill sites on the state under the Reclamation Act and on home rule units. Plaintiffs had to comply with both state and county regulations. The trial court correctly found that the county zoning ordinance at issue was not preempted by the Reclamation Act. The county's failure to object to the issuance of a mining permit to the company's owner was only nonaction and not a positive act. Estoppel would have been improper because the company's owner had failed to show a justified reliance on any conduct by the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it created an irrational distinction between &quot;residential&quot; and &quot;commercial&quot; refuse pick-up accounts and because it acted to deprive defendant of a vested property interest. Further, defendant asserted that the trial court erred in striking its affirmative defenses although they had previously been addressed in ruling on defendant's motion to dismiss the ordinance prosecution. The city defended the classification on grounds it worked to limit the numbers of large, heavy garbage trucks present in primarily residential neighborhoods. By limiting the number of refuse haulers in such areas, the city continued, it was limiting congestion, noise, and damage to residential streets which were not built to withstand heavy truck traffic. The court held that the city had advanced valid reasons for the ordinance at issue. Likewise, the classification of &quot;residential&quot; property created by the ordinance was rationally related to promoting the public interest in limiting noise, congestion, and street damage in primarily residential neighborhoods.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The court found that a mental state of either intent, knowledge, or recklessness could have been implied for offenses involving sexual penetration, and the statute did not punish innocent conduct or set up an unconstitutional anomaly between the lesser and greater offenses. The court also found that an examination of approved jury instructions relating to sex offenses demonstrated that instructions defining general intent offenses did not need to set forth a specific mental state, and thus, the trial court did not err in failing to sua sponte instruct the jury as to defendant's mental state. The court determined that there had been no objection to either the testimony relating to defendant's prior conviction or to the prosecutor alluding to it in argument, and defendant had introduced the prior conviction as part of his trial strategy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The losing candidates contested the election results on the ground that voters in the primary election had also signed the nominating petitions for independent candidates and argued that the trial court's order postponing the election was not appealable under Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 307(a)(1). In vacating the order and remanding the matter, the court held that the order was appealable as a restraint on the winning candidate that was essentially injunctive in character. The trial court had no authority to enjoin an election unless injunctive relief was necessary to prevent a waste of public funds by the holding of an election under an unconstitutional election statute or any election called in violation of the constitution. This case did not involve that exception. Under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 46, para. 2A-1.1(b), electors were guaranteed a right to vote by a certain date; interference with that right was not justified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, Illinois Racing Board (board) and stewards, appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Rock Island County (Illinois), which held that plaintiff horse trainer was entitled to a preliminary injunction against defendants that prevented defendants from excluding the trainer from all racetracks under the supervision of the board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trainer was accused of racing a horse following illegal surgery on the horse. The stewards suspended the trainer for one year and excluded him from all racetracks under the supervision of the board. About four months later, the trainer obtained a temporary restraining order against defendants. He subsequently obtained a preliminary injunction that was to remain in effect until he exhausted all of his administrative remedies. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment after modifying the preliminary injunction. The court held that the initial temporary restraining order was an improper interference with defendants' duties. However, because the trainer's exclusion from racetracks deprived him of his only means of making a living, the trainer had a due process property right to a reasonably prompt hearing under the Illinois Horse Racing Act of 1975, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 8, para. 37-1 et seq. (1985). Because the board never reviewed the stewards' action, the lower court properly entered a temporary injunction against defendants. However, the court held that the injunction was to be modified such that it expired after any decision rendered by the board.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment, which held that the trainer was entitled to a preliminary injunction against defendants to prevent them from enforcing a suspension that excluded the trainer from racetracks.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers of the village advised newspaper employees, who were conducting door-to-door sales of subscriptions to the newspaper in the village, that a commercial solicitation permit was required for them to do so.

The newspaper sought a declaration that the ordinance violated constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech, press, due process, and equal protection of the law as applied to the conduct of the newspaper when it solicited newspaper subscriptions in the village. The trial court permanently enjoined the village and its employees from subjecting the newspaper to the commercial solicitation regulations of its ordinance, and the village appealed. The court affirmed. The court agreed with the village that there was a distinction in the degree of first amendment protection afforded commercial and noncommercial speech, but ruled that the newspaper's right to freedom of speech and the press was no less than that of the other organizations against which the commercial solicitation restrictions were not applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner ex-husband and respondent ex-wife challenged two rulings from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which entered judgment in one action that the ex-husband pay the ex-wife's attorney fees to oppose a preliminary injunction; in the second action, the circuit court dismissed the ex-wife's petition for attorney fees incurred in the ex-wife's opposition to the ex-husband's motion to vacate the dissolution judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties continued litigation after the dissolution as disputes erupted over the ex-wife's proposed removal of the couples' children to Washington, D.C. The ex-husband filed motions to vacate the dissolution judgment and for preliminary injunction. The ex-wife sought attorney fees for those actions. The trial court dismissed as untimely the ex-wife's petition as to the motion to vacate the dissolution judgment but granted the ex-wife's petition as to the injunctive orders. Both parties appealed, and the court affirmed the judgment that granted attorney fees to the ex-wife and reversed the judgment that dismissed the ex-wife's petition for attorney fees in the other action. The court held that the ex-wife, who successfully obtained a dissolution of the preliminary injunction, was entitled to damages and that the judgment amount was reasonable. The ex-wife properly waited for a decision on the appeal on the motion to vacate the dissolution judgment to file her petition for attorney fees, at which time the ex-wife would know the exact amount of the fees. This avoided piecemeal litigation. The trial court had jurisdiction of the case and erred in dismissing the ex-wife's petition.</SPAN></P>

Without deciding whether the amusement tax was an occupation tax, the court held that it did not violate the constitutional home rule provision, Ill. Const. art.

The driver had refused to take the breath test after being arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501.</SPAN></P>

The driver contended that there was insufficient evidence to support his arrest, that the suspension should have been rescinded after the court's failure to review his review petition within the 30-day period mandated in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 2-118.1, and that the prosecution failed to prove that the driver had been advised of the consequences of his refusal to participate in the mandatory breath test. The court on appeal reversed the trial court's decision based on its determination that (1) the prosecution met ifs burden of proving the driver's DUI violation by a preponderance of evidence; (2) the trial court failed to comply with the due process requirements of para. 2-118.1, and its failure to do so required rescission of the driver's license suspension; and (3) Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 11-501(c) required the arresting officer to advise defendant that a refusal to submit to the breath test would result in a license suspension.</SPAN></P>

Almost one year later, defendant filed his petition for relief alleging that his plea was involuntary and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed. Defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing as a matter of right. In order to obtain an evidentiary hearing, defendant had to make a substantial showing of a constitutional violation. The record negated both allegations of constitutional error. The trial court found defendant made a knowing and voluntary plea. The trial court inquired whether defendant understood the plea, and whether he had been forced into the plea. The trial court also specifically asked defendant if his attorney pressured him to accept the plea agreement, to which defendant responded &quot;no.&quot; The trial court's admonitions pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 402 were thorough, and the record made at the time defendant entered his plea negated his claims of constitutional error; therefore, the trial court did not err in dismissing the petition without an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court found that it was without authority to proceed with the review because the jurisdiction of the court to review the order of the commission was not properly invoked. The court determined that the transfer by the circuit court was improper as such a transfer was not sanctioned under state civil practice law, the state supreme court rules, or the Administrative Review Law, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110 (1983). The court also determined that the transfer by the circuit court was invalid because it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to take any action with respect to direct administrative review in the appellate court, including any authority to transfer the cause to the appellate court. The court concluded that, as the circuit court was without subject matter jurisdiction at the time the complaint was filed, it therefore lacked the authority to transfer the complaint erroneously brought before it to the appellate court.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 440 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer contended that the occupation tax was unconstitutional, that it violated the United States-Swiss tax treaty, and that it violated the foreign commerce clause, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part, holding that: (1) the goods were not &quot;in transit&quot; within the meaning of the import-export clause merely because they were in the process of entering the state of their destination at the time the tax was imposed; (2) the tax did not fall on the goods themselves, but rather on the privilege of engaging in the business of selling goods at retail in the state as measured by the gross receipts of the sales; (3) the tax was a permissible, nondiscriminatory exaction applied without regard to the foreign origin of the goods; (4) the tax did not divert federal revenues to the state; (5) the tax did not discriminate against Swiss citizens residing in the United States by taxing them more heavily than United States citizens; however, (6) the trial court's finding that the tax was constitutional should have been applied prospectively rather than retroactively, negating imposition of interest and penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer owned a tract of land that fell within two sewage treatment regions. The developer sought approval from an IEPA commission to connect to the most convenient system.

The developer brought a declaratory judgment action requesting in count I that the use of void system boundaries be found unconstitutional, in count II that the refusal to consider the issue without an agreement with all towns involved be held unconstitutional, and in count III that the IEPA's use of the boundary that bisected its tract be found unconstitutional. The circuit court granted the IEPA's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On appeal, the court noted that all three counts failed because the developer did not exhaust administrative remedies. An exception to the exhaustion rule existed if an agency rule or order was being challenged on its face as not being authorized by statute, but none of the three counts fell within the exception.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, along with two accomplices, entered the garage of a victim and shot him twice, killing him. Defendant and the men then stole money from the victim's wallet and searched his home for more money. On appeal, defendant argued that the State's use of peremptory challenges to exclude all black jurors from the jury violated his constitutional rights to equal protection and trial by an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community. In affirming the conviction, the court ruled that defendant had waived his challenge since he had failed to raise the issue in any of his post-trial motions. The court ruled that Batson, which allowed a defendant to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination based on the prosecution's use of peremptory challenges to strike members of the defendant's race from the jury venire, did apply to defendant's case. However, determinations of discrimination were findings of fact for a trial court. Because defendant did not present the question to the trial court, the challenge was waived. A prior consistent statement was admissible because it was used to show a recent fabrication.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para.11 -- 501.1 (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing his request for a hearing date other than the arraignment date, in placing the burden of proof on defendant in the suspension hearing, and in failing to properly consider the testimony of four witnesses. Defendant further argued that the mandatory summary suspension unconstitutionally deprived him of a property interest. The court disagreed. The decision to hold the rescission hearing on the afternoon of the same day that defendant filed his petition was not contrary to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, para. 2 -- 118.1(b). Furthermore, in effect the trial court allowed defendant a later opportunity to be heard when defendant examined all four witnesses who were with him on the night of the arrest. The allocation of the burden of proof on defendant was proper. The findings of the trial court regarding the testimony would not be overturned because they were not manifestly against the weight of evidence. Use of a driver's license was not a fundamental interest. Therefore, the statute under which the suspension was effected was constitutional because it had a rational relationship to the state's interest in public safety.</SPAN></P>

Defendant agreed to plead guilty to armed robbery, and the state agreed to drop the rest of the charges against him.

The court held that substantially erroneous information concerning a sentence provided by defendant's attorney was below the level of competence required of criminal defense attorneys.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which upheld the validity of a use tax assessment against the taxpayer in its tax protest action against defendants, the Director of the Department of Revenue of the State of Illinois and the State Treasurer of the State of Illinois.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was engaged in the oil refining business. Under protest, the taxpayer paid use taxes that were assessed on its use of certain &quot;refinery fuels,&quot; which were by-products of the oil refining process. The trial court found that the taxpayer was entitled to a return of a portion of the tax because of a computation error. However, the trial court otherwise upheld the assessment, and the taxpayer appealed. The court held that the Use Tax Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 120, para. 439.1 et seq. (1981), was not unconstitutionally vague as applied. The court concluded that the Department had the authority to implement the measure of use tax prescribed by the legislature. The court further held that the Department's allocation of the selling price on the basis of relative volume was reasonable. The court rejected the alternative methods of calculation preferred by the taxpayer. The court also rejected the taxpayer's contention that the Department's construction of the Act was discriminatory and violative of equal protection. The fact that the taxpayer raised the price of its premium products to cover the crude oil cost did not prove that the taxpayer was subjected to double taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal issue on appeal was the manner in which the Illinois Parentage Act (IPA), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, par. 2501 et seq. (1985), was to be applied to paternity actions filed prior to its effective date. Based on the IPA provisions, the father contended that the action, brought almost five years after the birth of the child, was barred by the two-year limitation on actions brought on behalf of any person other than the child. In an action on behalf of the mother, the State sought to hold the father liable for the support of the child as well as the mother's reasonable expenses arising from her pregnancy. The father moved to dismiss based on the statute of limitations contained in the newly enacted IPA. The trial court denied the motion because the complaint was filed prior to the effective date of the IPA. The court affirmed the order denying the father's motion to dismiss, but not on the grounds advanced by the trial court. The court held that the action could also be fairly construed as one brought on behalf of the child within the meaning of the IPA and thus would be barred only if brought later than two years after the child reached the age of majority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a county treasurer and his son-in-law, challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court of Sangamon County (Illinois), which denied them relief in their action seeking a declaration that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 102, para. 4.1 (1985), which barred county officials and their employees and certain of their relatives from participating in county tax sales, violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs were the principal shareholders of a corporation that purchased delinquent taxes at various sales. Para 4.1 prohibited plaintiffs from participating in the tax sales. The State argued that para. 4.1 was constitutional because it was related to the legitimate interest of preserving fair competition. In reversing the trial court's judgment that found the statute constitutional, the court ruled that the classification scheme of para. 4.1 went too far, thus violating the Equal Protection Clause. Assuming arguendo that the State had propounded legitimate purposes for the statute, the court ruled that the classifications it created did not rationally relate to promoting State interests. By the terms of the statute, a part-time custodian in one county courthouse was prohibited from participating in another county's tax sales. Such a sweeping classification bore no relationship to protecting the integrity, or perceived integrity, of real estate tax sales in Illinois. The category of persons precluded from buying at tax sales had to be limited to those reasonably viewed as having access to information that might put them at an unfair advantage in buying delinquent taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband challenged the award of prospective and retroactive attorney's fees, child support, and maintenance to his wife. On appeal, the court affirmed the award. The court found that there was sufficient evidence that the husband's sale of the marital home was a sham transaction. The court also found that the husband had an 18-year earnings history, while the wife only had a 6-month earning history. Thus, the court concluded that the wife was not on equal footing with the husband. The court reasoned that the almost 20-year duration of the marriage warranted a substantial division of the marital assets to the wife. The court noted that the husband's child support payments were only 30 percent of his net pay and were below the minimum amounts set by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch.40, para. 504 (1983). The court further determined that the attorney's fees incurred were necessitated by the husband's attempt to set aside the sham transaction finding. Lastly, the court held that the trial court had authority to award the wife prospective attorney's fees to defend the instant appeal where her financial resources were limited and the husband was in a financial position to pay.</SPAN></P>

The court found that when the revolver was first referred to in police testimony, defendant did not object until 16 questions were asked and answered concerning the weapon during the direct examination of the officer. Any prejudice which may have resulted from the admission of defendant's pistol was minimized by witnesses who were examined and cross-examined concerning this weapon at all times, making it clear to the jury that it could not have been the murder weapon. The court also found that none of the points presented by defendant undermined the eyewitness identification which was premised on three separate opportunities to observe defendant The court did not abuse its discretion where it examined all the facts of the case and the sentencing report, and determined that defendant's conduct was at a level of brutality and heinousness which warranted the severe punishment imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director was examining the board's pension fund when it discovered that the board had not made retroactive payment of retirement benefits in a retiree's case after his pension was adjusted. The director order the board to do so, but it refused to do so because it did not believe it had the statutory authority. The board then filed for declaratory relief, and the trial court granted summary judgment in the board's favor finding that the director did not have jurisdiction to review the board's decisions. On appeal, the court affirmed. Under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 108 1/2, para. 3-148, the court found that the Administrative Review Law, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 3-101 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The workers filed workers' compensation claims against their employer. Before the Industrial Commission considered the claims, the employer, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of the guarantor, filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. Subsequently, the guarantor divested the employer. The workers then filed claims in the trial court against the guarantor for enforcement of an alleged guaranty agreement. The trial court concluded that the issues raised in the workers' request for declaratory relief could have been addressed in their workers' compensation claims before the Industrial Commission. Thus, the trial court granted the guarantor's motion to dismiss on the basis that the workers' failed to exhaust their remedies under the Workers' Compensation Act. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that, under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 138.4(g) (1983) of the Act, the Industrial Commission had the authority and jurisdiction to review and interpret the alleged guaranty agreement to determine who was legally bound to pay the workers' claims. Thus, the workers were required to exhaust their remedies with the Industrial Commission before seeking relief in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that he should have been resentenced by the original sentencing judge according to &sect; 5 -- 6 -- 4(h) of the Unif. Code Corr., Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005 -- 6 -- 4(h) (1985).</SPAN></P>

The State argued that &sect; 5 -- 4 -- 1(b) was violative of the separation of powers clause of Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1 (1970). On appeal by defendant, the court agreed with the State. The court found that &sect; 5 -- 4 -- 1(b) conflicted with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 21, which addressed the trial court's administrative responsibilities and which provided that the chief judge of each circuit could enter general orders in the exercise of his general administrative authority. Since there was an encroachment on the trial court's administrative responsibilities, &sect; 5 -- 4 -- 1(b) of the Unif. Code Corr., Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005 -- 4 -- 1(b) (1985), was unconstitutional. The court further found that defendant waived, by failing to allege in his motion to vacate sentence, any issue as to whether the judge who revoked defendant's probation was familiar with the factual basis of the offense.</SPAN></P>

He appealed his conviction on two counts of attempted murder and a count of aggravated battery. His attorney filed an Anders brief seeking leave to withdraw as counsel after finding no meritorious issues but requested that the aggravated-battery conviction be vacated as cumulative. Defendant filed a pro se brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that &sect; 122 -- 2.1 of the Code, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 122 -- 2.1 (1985), which allowed for dismissal of frivolous or patently meritless petitions before appointment of counsel, conflicted with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c), 103 Ill. 2d R. 651(c), and violated the separation of powers. He claimed that Rule 651(c) impliedly granted a right to counsel to indigent post-conviction petitioners. On appeal, the court found that the rule specifically concerned appeals from post-conviction proceedings and provided that upon the timely filing of a post-conviction notice of appeal by a petitioner found by the court to be indigent, a transcript of the record of the post-conviction proceedings must be prepared and filed with the court to which the appeal was taken and counsel on appeal must be appointed, both without cost to the petitioner. The court noted that the rule did not direct appointment of counsel for post-conviction petitions prior to the appellate stage; that was done by &sect; 122 -- 4 of the Code if the petition was not been found patently without merit or frivolous. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 122 -- 4 (1985). The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of retail theft under para. 16A-3(a) following a consolidated jury trial with his codefendant wife. Defendant was sentenced to a two-year term of imprisonment. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence. The court affirmed, finding that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for retail theft under an accountability theory. Defendant drove to the store and waited in his car while his wife functioned as a lookout and two other women stuffed merchandise into bags. The jury disbelieved defendant's explanation and concluded that rather than an innocent bystander, he was the women's partner in a shoplifting scheme. The court held that defendant failed to preserve an issue concerning the jury instructions since he did not object at trial nor complete the appeal record with instructions offered and given. Further, the retail theft statute was constitutional. Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel merely because his counsel also represented his codefendant wife.

The court initially determined that the look-alike statute was unconstitutional, but that decision was reversed by the Illinois Supreme Court, and the case was remanded for the court to determine: (1) whether instructions defining look-alike substances were misleading and inaccurate; and (2) whether the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury on entrapment. The court affirmed, and determined that: (1) jury instructions, although derived from the statute rather than from a pattern jury instruction, were proper because they accurately explained the offense to the jury and did not serve to confuse the jury; and (2) there was no requirement to instruct the jury on the defense of entrapment because even though defendant asserted the defense, no evidence of entrapment was presented and defendant chose to deny that she committed the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner applied to the village for a special use permit to build an asphalt plant. The village denied the application, promoting this suit. The owners and the trustee sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the village asking the court to declare the zoning ordinance invalid as it related to their property. They also sought to enjoin the village from interfering with their development and use of the property as an asphalt plant. Judgment was rendered in their favor, prompting the village and the residents to appeal. The owners cross-appealed denial of their motion for summary judgment to declare the ordinance unconstitutional. The court found summary judgment on the constitutional issue should have been granted. The ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because an ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense would have to guess as to whether an asphalt plant was a permitted, special, or prohibited use under the ordinance. Moreover, the ordinance unconstitutionally delegated legislative power to the village board of trustees to determine the status of a proposed use without sufficient criteria.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, two landowners and a bank acting as trustee, sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Will County (Illinois), which was entered upon a motion for directed verdict filed by defendant county, in plaintiffs' action seeking a declaratory judgment that a zoning ordinance was unconstitutional and void as it applied to the landowners' property and an order enjoining the county from interfering with the use of such property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners bought land and subdivided it for single-family residential development. At the time the landowners bought the property at issue, in the name of the bank, such property was zoned in part for residential development, and the landowners subdivided a portion for such development. The county later adopted a comprehensive amendment to its zoning ordinance which affected plaintiffs' property in such a way as to prohibit further residential development. Plaintiffs brought an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the county, and the trial court entered judgment upon a motion for directed verdict in favor of the county. Plaintiffs appealed, and the court reversed, holding that plaintiffs established by clear and convincing evidence that as applied to the property at issue, the ordinance was unreasonable, arbitrary, and without substantial relationship to the health, safety, morals, or general welfare, and thus, the trial court erred in directing a verdict in favor of the county. The court concluded that the evidence weighed substantially in favor of plaintiffs, including that residential development was compatible with the surrounding property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to the offense of delivering more than 15 grams of a controlled substance after his motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds was denied.

Stat. ch. 56 1/2, para. 1401 (1985), was unconstitutional. That motion was denied, prompting this appeal. Defendant argued the progressive sentencing classifications and mandatory minimum jail sentence of &sect; 401 were unconstitutional because they were contrary to the limitation-of-penalties provision of Ill. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1970). The court found the legislature was entitled to impose these sentencing schemes for drug offenses. Defendant also argued his right to a speedy trial was violated by the State's delay of over one year in bringing his case to trial. However, the court found defendant never made a trial demand while he was free on bail, so the 160-day statutory period under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 103-5(b) (1985) within which he had to be brought to trial never began.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patients appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), which dismissed defendant health plan from the patients' malpractice action based upon the Voluntary Health Services Plans Act (act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 32, para. 595 et seq. (1983). The patients claimed the act's exemption from liability for voluntary health services plan corporations violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patients filed a complaint against the health plan and a doctor for medical malpractice for a failed tubal ligation. The trial court granted the health plan's motion to dismiss, and the patients appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the patient and her child failed to sustain her burden of showing that the classification was unrelated to a legitimate governmental interest. Voluntary health services plans were medical care delivery systems through which medical, hospital, nursing, and related health services were rendered to a subscriber or beneficiary. Generally, the plans ensured the availability of health services for a subscriber population by utilizing a prepayment method of financing and a group practice mode for delivery of services. The court concluded that the legislature had clearly carved out a separate and distinct classification of health care providers, distinguishable from other health care providers because they served the unique function of both insurer and health care provider. The unique organizational structure and regulation of the voluntary health services plan corporation provided a rational basis for immunizing the health plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that dismissed the health plan from the patients' medical malpractice action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the forfeiture was improper, that his convictions should be reversed because the search warrant was invalid, the state did not prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and the prosecutor's allegations were unsupported and highly improper, and that he was improperly sentenced. The court affirmed the trial court's forfeiture order and defendant's conviction for unlawful use of weapons but reversed his conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and remanded the case for a new trial on the possession charge and resentencing on the weapons' charge. The court found that defendant received due process in the timely filed forfeiture proceeding and that a sufficient nexus between the cash and the illegal substances raised the presumption that the cash was forfeitable. The court concluded that the cumulative impact of prosecutorial misconduct could have prejudiced the jury. While the indictment was poorly drafted, it cited the unlawful-use-of-weapons statute under which defendant was charged and sufficiently informed him of the charged violation to both protect him from double jeopardy and enable him to prepare a defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a lingerie model. At trial, the State's only witness testified that he had paid to receive masturbatory massages from defendant and to perform oral sex upon her. The State's witness also testified that earlier in the day, before the trial had begun, he had recognized defendant when the witness was sitting outside in the hall. On appeal from her conviction for prostitution, defendant contended that the circuit court erred in admitting the witness's out-of-court identification of defendant on the day of trial and that the admission of the prior identification was prejudicial because the State repeatedly emphasized the witness's credibility in its closing argument. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the prior out-of-court identification on the day of trial was properly admitted because nothing in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 115-12 (1983) nor Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(C) required a very recent prior identification. The State's emphasis of the witness's credibility did not make the admission of the identification erroneous because the prosecutor's comments did not place the office of a state's attorney behind the witness.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff prisoner, claiming to represent a class of persons, brought an action against defendants, members of the Illinois Prisoner Review Board, in which he sought a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. He claimed that an amendment to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1003-3-5(f) was an ex post facto law. The Circuit Court of Randolph County (Illinois) dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action. The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the prisoner's parole hearing, the amended para. 1003-3-5(f) provided that the Prisoner Review Board could set a prisoner's parole hearings three years apart. At the time of the offense, before the amendment, the parole hearings could be set one year apart. The court first held that the trial court properly dismissed the class action portions of the prisoner's complaint because the prisoner had not attempted to meet the prerequisites for maintaining a class action under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 2-801 (1985). The court stated, however, that the trial court should have allowed the prisoner to proceed individually on his contention that the amendment constituted an ex post facto law. The amendment was retrospective, and the retroactive elimination of the opportunity for an annual parole hearing was disadvantageous to the prisoner. Thus, it met both criteria for an ex post facto law, and the prisoner had stated a cause of action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the class action allegations. It reversed the remainder of the trial court's decision and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two men pulled a gun on the victim when she was sitting in her car. They entered her car, robbed her, and then drove her to a vacant, dead-end street where they sexually assaulted her before letting her go. The police received a phone call from someone who had information about the crime. After identifying the caller and interviewing him, they included defendant's photograph in a photographic array shown to the victim. She chose defendant's photo. On appeal, the court held that defendant had waived his contention that the criminal-sexual-assault statute was unconstitutionally vague because he did not raise this issue at trial. It further held that defendant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute. The court found the testimony of the officers concerning the telephone call to the department was not hearsay because the testimony was offered for the limited purpose of explaining the reason the police conducted their investigation as they did. The court held that defendant's acts supported the separate offense of aggravated kidnapping because the victim's asportation was not merely incidental to the commission of the armed robbery and criminal sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had lived with the victim in her house until shortly before his arrest. Although the victim permitted defendant to retain his house keys, she changed the front door lock. Defendant, who entered the locked house through a window screen, subsequently was arrested and convicted of criminal trespass to a residence and resisting a peace officer. Affirming the convictions, the court held that the jury reasonably could have concluded that defendant gained unauthorized entry by cutting or tearing the screen and that he knew such entry to be unauthorized. His retention of the keys did not symbolize an invitation to enter the house when he pleased. The victim's testimony on defendant's non-authority to enter was not so improbable as to raise a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. Further, defendant's manner of entry could not reasonably be construed to be pursuant to any invitation that arose from his possession of the keys. The evidence also supported the resisting arrest conviction because defendant backed away and protested; twice refused to put his hands behind his back; and, when officers resorted to force, he responded by holding his arms stiff at his sides and struggling.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge found defendant in criminal contempt but mentally ill, and found that the mental illness was insufficient to constitute a defense of insanity. Defendant claimed that the judgment was error because the trial court failed to follow the statutorily mandated procedure in finding defendant guilty and to hold a hearing on defendant's sanity. The court reversed the judgment. The court held that the statutes regarding pleas of guilty but mentally ill did not apply because the contempt proceeding was a summary proceeding where no pleas were taken. However, the court did find that a hearing was mandated because contempt required intent, and if there was a question of defendant's mental capacity to form intent, then the elements of contempt were no longer within the trial judge's personal knowledge. The trial judge should have held a hearing on defendant's mental illness and ability to form intent, but because the original charge was dismissed and defendant already served his contempt sentence, remand was not necessary.</SPAN></P>

The contractor attempted over time to correct the problems, but was not successful. The building owner brought an action against defendants, alleging breach of contract, and the trial court dismissed the action, holding that the case was time-barred by the two-year statute of limitations, Ill.

The court held that his motion to suppress was properly denied because exigent circumstances justified the officers' removal of the motorcycle to a police station until a search warrant could have been obtained. Moreover, the court held that a reasonable jury could have found his guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence was ample of the control by defendant of the premises that he owned. Based on the evidence, the jury could have applied the inferences of possession arising from control.

The court denied the petition. The court held that the unconstitutionality of the statute did not effect the court's initial order that counsel be appointed to represent defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a felony in 1965, and at that time, he was only prohibited from possessing firearms for five years following the conviction.

At trial, defendant claimed a companion owned the guns and denied any connection with the guns. The police never claimed to have seen the target pistol on defendant's person. The jury was instructed that defendant could be found guilty of unlawful use of weapons if he had actual or constructive possession of the guns, and defendant was found guilty of unlawful use of weapons by a felon. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 24-1.1(a) was not an ex post facto law because defendant's prior conviction was only an element of the offense, and new acts after the passage of &sect; 24-1.1(a) were required to convict defendant.

On appeal, the court affirmed and found that defendant was not prejudiced by the pretrial identification procedure because there was nothing unduly suggestive about the lineup and that there were sufficient indicia of reliability in the driver's lineup identification because he had ample opportunity to view defendant during the robbery. While defendant was entitled to representation, he was not entitled to be represented by the attorney of his choice. Defendant, who had been involved in the criminal justice system on several occasions, made an intelligent waiver of his right to counsel, and his Sixth Amendment rights were not violated by the state's failure name an officer as a witness or to produce documents that were not in its possession.

The business owner also sought an injunction and damages. The director filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 2 and &sect; 3 were not unconstitutional because they provided fair notice of the conduct that was forbidden and established guidelines for the department. The fact that the Act did not delineate every conceivable item that fell within its proscription did not render it unconstitutional. Further, the Act's requirement of scienter weighed against a finding of vagueness. The court found that the business owner was not entitled to injunctive relief because he failed to demonstrate the likelihood of a recurrence of the search and because he had an adequate remedy at law under Ill.

Since the alleged vagueness of the statute did not affect the outcome of the case, the court did not decide whether the lack of a definition of mental disease renders Ill. Crim. Code &sect; 6-2 unconstitutionally vague. The trial court error in allowing a witness to testify regarding defendant's post-arrest silence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the trial court entered sentence on an improper judgment. Although the sentences entered by the trial court remained available to that court upon a judgment of guilty but mentally ill under Ill. Rev.

The trailer lessee leased the trailer from the leasing corporation and the truck driver was the person who parked the trailer along the road. The primary allegations of plaintiffs' complaint concerned inadequate lighting on the street, inadequate lighting on the parked trailer, and improper placement of the bumper on the rear of the trailer. On appeal, the trailer lessee, the leasing corporation, and the truck driver argued that the settlement between the manufacturer and plaintiffs was invalid. Upon review, the court found that the argument was without merit. In light of the status of the lawsuit and pleadings, and of the ensuing negotiations, the settlement did not appear disproportionate. The trailer lessee, the leasing corporation, and the truck driver failed to prove an absence of good faith in the settlement by clear and convincing evidence. The fact that the settlement also compromised other counts, entirely separate and apart from the products liability count of the complaint, showed that there was no basis upon which to disturb the trial court's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a conviction in the Circuit Court of Rock Island County (Illinois) for sexual assault. He contended that the privilege afforded for confidential communications between the rape victim and the rape crisis counselor under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 8-802.1 (1985) unconstitutionally impaired his due process rights to confront witnesses against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction for sexual assault, defendant contended on appeal that his due process rights were violated because he was not allowed to cross-examine the victim's rape counselor regarding the victim's statements that could have been exculpatory or could have impeached the victim's testimony. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the absolute privilege of confidentiality granted by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 8-802.1 (1985) was not unconstitutional. The statute was specifically amended to eliminate in camera disclosure, thus converting the conditional privilege into an absolute privilege, and it provided a penalty for breach of confidentiality. The court noted that the statute was enacted with the express purpose of promoting the prosecution of sex offenders, and that the relationship of a rape counselor and victim was similar to that of an attorney and client in that the communication was the first step in promoting the pursuit of justice. Among the primary services of the rape counselor was to support the victim in pursuing the prosecution of the perpetrator.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated defendant's conviction for aggravated arson because the statute was previously declared unconstitutional. Because the State failed to inform defendant of its intention to introduce exculpatory evidence, the court held that the trial court committed reversible error by admitting the evidence and denying defendant's motion for a mistrial. Defendant's girlfriend testified that, five days before the arson, defendant threatened to set fire to her house. The state did not inform defense counsel of its intent to introduce the statement into evidence. The prosecutorial discovery misconduct was grounds for a mistrial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After entering the home of an acquaintance, defendant allegedly fondled the breasts and genitals of the acquaintance's eldest daughter. Defendant was charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault, two counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, and residential burglary. The state amended the information to dismiss the charge of aggravated criminal sexual assault. The jury found defendant not guilty of residential burglary, but convicted him on the remaining charges. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting the victim's mother's testimony as to what the victim told her. Defendant also claimed that the state statutes dealing with sexual offenses were unconstitutionally vague and resulted in a denial of due process. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction. Although the trial court erred in admitting the mother's testimony as to what the victim told her, the error was harmless because defendant's guilt was overwhelmingly established. Moreover, the statutes concerning sexual offenses were not unconstitutional merely because the prosecutor possessed a certain amount of discretion in determining with which offense defendant was to be charged.</SPAN></P>

The court said that the evidence destroyed contained no exculpatory information. Therefore, that evidence was immaterial. Second, the court found that police had probable cause to arrest defendant because he was in a car that matched a description of that involved in a shooting incident and because he matched the victim's description of the shooter. Third, the court held that defendant did not show that statements made by him while in custody were involuntary. Fourth, the court held that a delay of 29 hours between defendant's arrest and arraignment was not unreasonable. Fifth, the court dismissed defendant's appeal of the armed violence conviction because there was no sentence and, thus, no final judgment.

He claimed it was unconstitutional to punish the offenses as felonies using different property-value thresholds. The court found that there was a rational basis for the distinction and that no equal protection rights were violated. The court also rejected defendant's claim that the disparity in punishment violated due-process protections because the legislature could reasonably conclude that there was a greater detriment to the state's economy, along with a greater opportunity for committing the offense of retail theft as opposed to simple theft.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court affirmed. The court determined that testimony regarding rape trauma syndrome was properly allowed where the testimony was admitted in rebuttal for the limited purpose of explaining to the jury how victims of child abuse react. The court found testimony of a social worker regarding the victim identifying defendant was erroneously admitted pursuant to Ill. Rev.

However, the court held the error was harmless where the victim testified that defendant had abused her and identity of defendant was not at issue during the trial. The court concluded that the aggravated criminal sexual abuse statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-16(c)(1), and the aggravated criminal sexual assault statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-14(b)(1), were not unconstitutionally vague where they were clearly discernable and defined.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, acting pro se, entered a negotiated plea of guilty to one count of armed robbery.

The trial court dismissed the petition as patently without merit under &sect; 122-2.1 of the Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para 122-2.1 (1985). Defendant appealed. The court affirmed the dismissal. Case law precedent holding that &sect; 122-2.1 did not conflict with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c) remained the law. Because &sect; 122-8 of the Act was added in an attempt to afford a petitioner even greater protections under the Act, it was not an indispensable component without which the statutory scheme could not have operated. The trial court was still required to consider a petition and initially determine whether the substantive matters raised were frivolous. Thus, &sect; 122-2.1 was severable from &sect; 122-8, and its validity was upheld despite the unconstitutionality of &sect; 122-8. There was no indication that defendant was not lucid or did not understand the proceedings when he entered his plea. Thus, there was no error in dismissing the petition.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment and appealed, arguing that &sect; 12-16(a)(1) of the Criminal Code of 1961 was unconstitutional, that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing, and that errors were committed during trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the felony of aggravated criminal sexual abuse under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para.12-16 (a)(1) (1985), and alleged that the statute was unconstitutional because the same offense when committed by use of force was a misdemeanor. In holding the statute constitutional, the court held that the legislature rationally determined that the threat of the use of force with a dangerous weapon had a greater potential for harm than the actual use of force absent any weapon. After noting that the versions of what happened told by defendant and the victim were exactly contrary to each other, the court stated that the testimony of one witness, if positive and credible, was sufficient to sustain a conviction even though the accused contradicted the witness. There was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to determine the credibility issues against defendant. Opinion testimony of which defendant complained was a continuation of a line of questioning which defendant initiated, and he could not complain of its admission. The court held that an allegation of ineffective counsel could not be based upon speculation, and that defendant had received effective assistance.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that the admission of defendant's confession violated his Fourth Amendment right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure. Because codefendant's suppressed confession was insufficient to establish probable cause to arrest defendant the court reasoned that defendant's own confession should have been suppressed as a fruit of the poisonous tree. The court also determined that a good-faith invalid arrest warrant for codefendant could not support a determination that defendant's warrantless arrest was in good faith because the good-faith modification of the exclusionary rule did not apply to warrantless arrests.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed a class action lawsuit against appellees and alleged that the airport caused excessive noise, vibration, and air pollution. Appellants argued that the airport deprived them of the use and enjoyment of their property, injured their physical and mental health, amounted to a taking for public use of their private property, and constituted a continuing nuisance. Appellees moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that federal law preempted appellants' claims for nuisance and trespass. The lower court dismissed appellants' complaint. Appellants challenged the lower court judgment and argued that federal law did not preempt the nuisance or trespass claims. The court affirmed the lower court judgment because appellants were barred from pursuing the nuisance and trespass claims. The court determined that since federal laws and regulations preempted local control of aircraft flights, appellees could not be charged with creating a nuisance to the extent they complied with such federal laws and regulations. The court held that appellants failed to allege that appellees violated federal regulations in the operation of the airport.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence presented at trial established that the real estate company was the company that was responsible for the maintenance and repair of a certain property in Chicago. The first building inspector for the city testified that he inspected the building and found pickets missing from a second-floor landing, water standing four inches deep in the basement, and broken plaster and peeling paint in some of the upstairs apartments. A few months later, a second inspector found rotten wood on the rear porches, peeling paint, broken windows, and garbage infested with rats. On appeal, defendants contended that the criminal-housing-management statute was void for vagueness and that the informations did not sufficiently inform them of the nature and elements of the offenses. The court affirmed the convictions and found that the Illinois criminal housing management statute was constitutional. The court also found that the informations were sufficient because defendants could glean from the charging document the accusations that, at a particular time and at a particular location, they permitted the property to become or remain deteriorated to a point where it endangered the occupants.</SPAN></P>

He was found not guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol. He contended that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant's motion for severance and other contentions. The court affirmed and held that defendant failed to establish sufficient grounds for severance. The mere apprehension that joinder may have resulted in prejudice, without a showing that such apprehensions were well founded, was an insufficient ground for severance. Thus, mere speculation by a jury of possible past convictions of defendant was not sufficient to establish prejudice. The court held further that &sect; 11 -- 501(a)(1) of the Illinois Vehicle Code states a single offense, and defendant cannot claim that he was charged with a hybrid of two offenses. Rather, the amended complaint merely described the manner in which the state intended to show that defendant's alcohol concentration was .10 or more. Failure to admit testimony as to the improvements on an Intoxilyzer machine did not constitute prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The hospital and the physician filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, raising the immunity from civil liability afforded under the Illinois Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 23, para. 2051 et seq. DCFS and the child protective worker also filed a motion to dismiss, asserting that exclusive jurisdiction of the matter rested in the Court of Claims. The trial court of Champaign County granted both motions, and the parents appealed. The court held that the Act &sect; 5, which provided for temporary protective custody was not unconstitutional.

He was sentenced to incarceration. His conviction was affirmed on appeal. Defendant filed a petition for post-conviction relief and alleged that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel because of a conflict of interest between himself and a codefendant, and because of incompetence of counsel. The circuit court entered an order dismissing the post-conviction petition without conducting a hearing, and found that the petition was patently without merit. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant's contention that a conflict of interest on the part of his trial counsel led to ineffective assistance of counsel amounted to mere speculation. No actual conflict was established. The evidence of defendant's guilt was very strong, and the outcome of defendant's trial was not affected by defense counsel's failure to respond to improper remarks by the prosecution. Defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced in any way by the manner in which his defense was conducted, or that there was a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners sought a declaration that the special use permit granted to the developer was invalid and an injunction preventing the developer from constructing the building. The trial court upheld the validity of the permit, finding that the property was suitable for use of elderly housing as the area was predominantly residential, with retail and commercial uses, and that the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare outweighed the destruction of property values and the hardship imposed on individual property owners. On appeal, the court affirmed. It found that the homeowners did not satisfy their burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the special use of housing for the elderly bore no substantial relation to the public welfare. At best, they showed that a difference of opinion existed concerning the reasonableness of the special use, which was insufficient to compel a finding that the special use was unconstitutional. Further, the variations the homeowners referred to in the special use permit were simply exceptions to zoning code requirements. As such, the ordinance granting a special use with exceptions to the developer was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision, which upheld the validity of the special use permit granted to the developer and denied the homeowner's request for an injunction preventing the developer from building an apartment building for housing the elderly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of various offenses and appealed, claiming that the circuit court erroneously applied the amended statute effective January 1, 1984, in finding him guilty but mentally ill under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 6-2 (1983), so as to violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 10, and additionally challenging the sufficiency of the evidence of defendant's sanity at the time of the offenses. The court affirmed, finding there was no reversible error because the circuit trial court found that the State had proved defendant's sanity beyond a reasonable doubt as required by the law in effect at the time the offense were committed. The presentation of evidence at trial as to sanity proceeded as under the old law, with defendant first raising the issue of insanity by the introduction of evidence to overcome the presumption of sanity and the State then presenting rebuttal testimony to prove defendant's sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. Any error in the circuit court's application of the amended insanity statute was harmless. The circuit court's determination of defendant's sanity was supported by surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the Illinois Domestic Violence Act (Act), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 2301-1 et seq. (1983), was not unconstitutionally vague because the terms surrounding the word harass in the Act delineated the type of conduct that was prohibited and the Act only prohibited those actions that were done with the intent to cause harm in violation of a domestic violence order.</SPAN></P>

The court questioned whether a finding of equal support by both parents was a true representation of an analysis of the financial needs and resources of both parents.

It purchased rolls of tax stamps from both states and affixed the proper tax stamp of the state in which the cigarettes were to be sold. Concerning Iowa-stamped cigarettes, the distributor sold and delivered some to retailers whose warehouses were located in Illinois yet retailed the cigarettes only in Iowa. The department assessed the distributor tax and penalties for the sale of Iowa-stamped cigarettes, ruling that in addition to the Iowa tax stamp, the distributor was required to purchase and affix an Illinois tax stamp to each pack. All of the cigarettes bearing the Iowa tax were retailed in Iowa and none were nor could be retailed in Illinois. The trial court affirmed this decision. On appeal, the court held that that the imposition of the Illinois cigarette stamp tax on Iowa-stamped cigarettes destined for sale in Iowa was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce in violation of U.S. Const. art.

On review the court found no error. Defendant claimed that individuals charged under the ordinary theft or the retail theft statute were similarly situated, that the current statutory scheme was arbitrary and irrational, that it was not reasonably designed to remedy the evil at which it was directed, and that the legislature only inadvertently failed to correspondingly amend the retail theft statute. The court held that the retail-theft statute was constitutionally enacted to respond to the specific nature of theft in retail establishments. Due process did not require identical felony-value levels in the different types of theft and there was a reasonable basis for the felony-value levels in the instant statutory scheme. The felony-level differences between retail theft and ordinary theft were products of the legislature's prerogative to respond to the specific nature of theft in certain establishments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation operated an adult book and video store in the county. The store included 29 booths where patrons could watch sexually explicit videotapes on coin-operated television sets. The county charged the corporation with violating its comprehensive zoning ordinance by operating the &quot;mini-theaters&quot; without first acquiring a special-use permit from the county board. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because the zoning ordinance did not include sufficiently narrow, objective, and definite standards to guide the county board in deciding whether to permit a mini-theatre in the district, it was unconstitutional and could not have been applied to the corporation. The court held that the corporation could continue its business under the &quot;grandfather&quot; provision of the ordinance as amended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The advertising company sought and received city permission to attach signs to a historic structure. After the signs were erected, the city revoked the permits. In affirming a judgment denying injunctive relief and holding that the permits were properly revoked, the court held that there was no constitutional violation in the ordinance revoking the permits, so the Immunity Act (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 85, para 2-104 (1985)) precluded any liability on the part of the city. The ordinance language sufficiently informed those in the adverting company' position of the requirements for satisfying the landmark ordinance. The advertising company knew landmark structures were present at the intersections, but failed to obtain necessary landmark commission approval. The city convincingly argued that the advertising company violated several ordinances, thus preventing it from acquiring vested property rights in the permits. Finally, the court held that the permits issued were permissive in nature, and could have been withdrawn at any time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners were issued citations for violating the municipal code banning outdoor advertising signs in certain residential districts. On a motion to dismiss, the homeowners alleged that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it restricted their first amendment right to commercial free speech and that it was impermissibly vague and overbroad. The trial court held that the ordinance was not vague but infringed on homeowners' constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of speech without a commensurate reason. The city appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the city failed to produce any evidence that the regulation of commercial speech served its substantial interest in improving traffic safety and the appearance of the city. The court noted that city erroneously assumed that the proscription of &quot;For Sale&quot; signs would prevent &quot;white flight&quot; by reducing public awareness of potential realty sales and thereby decreasing public concern over selling. But even assuming arguendo that the city's underlying objectives in banning &quot;For Sale&quot; signs were proper, it could not rely upon any assumptions but rather had to prove that the ordinance directly affected its interests.</SPAN></P>

It required attorneys representing clients in personal injury and domestic relations cases to submit an affidavit of compliance indicating the factual circumstances under which they had obtained their employment. The attorney contended that Rule 0.7 was invalid because it was contrary to the limitations imposed by constitutional and statutory law. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case. The court determined that Rule 0.7 exceeded the authority of Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 21(a) and Ill. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7(c) (1970). The court explained that Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 21 authorized the circuit court to adopt rules governing matters of pleading, practice, and procedure and that the range of Cook (Ill.) Cir. Ct., Rule 0.7 went far beyond Ill. Sup. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At its trial, the bookseller attempted to introduce into evidence ordinances from five Illinois municipalities which regulated zoning for adult theatres, bookstores, and nightclubs, but the trial court refused to admit such ordinances. Defendant contended this exclusion constituted error on the trial court's part because the ordinances were admissible as evidence of the degree of public acceptance of sexually explicit material pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20(4) (1983) and were relevant evidence of a statewide community standard. The court rejected that contention, holding that the admission of evidence was within the sound discretion of the trial court judge and that there was no clear showing that he had abused that discretion. Further, the court observed that the ordinances were not intended to be an acknowledgement by the municipalities that had adopted them of the public acceptance of materials deemed obscene. The fact the jury failed to accept testimony from a defense expert regarding a survey of statewide community standards did not mean the jurors did not apply a community standard to finding the bookseller guilty of obscenity.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the statute required merely a showing that there had been two prior findings of abuse; (2) abuse had not been proved by clear and convincing evidence at either of the juvenile proceedings or at the termination proceeding; (3) the statutes, in their requirement that abuse be proved merely by a preponderance of the evidence, deprived the parents if due process of law; and (4) Ill.

In reversing a judgment for plaintiff, the court held that the jury was improperly instructed on the issue of causation, even though the parties had not objected to the instruction.

He was convicted based on evidence that he had forced his way into the complainant's home by grabbing her by the arm as she tried to enter and thereafter compelled her to engage in sexual intercourse with him. He was sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment. On appeal, he argued that there was insufficient evidence of the bodily harm required to elevate criminal sexual assault to aggravated criminal sexual assault, that the trial judge should have instructed the jurors on the meaning of the phrase &quot;bodily harm,&quot; and that the trial judge improperly treated his rape charge in another state as an aggravating factor at sentencing. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding the bruising on the complainant's arm sufficient to qualify as bodily harm, and that defendant's jury instruction claim was waived. The court reversed as to sentencing, however, inasmuch as a mere arrest could not be treated as an aggravating factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in an amended information with ten counts of obscenity involving the sale of certain magazines seized during a search pursuant to a warrant. Following a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict, defendant was then tried in a jury trial on only three counts and was found guilty of all three counts of obscenity. Defendant sought review, contending that the issuing judge had insufficient facts to establish probable cause and that the search warrant did not sufficiently particularize the items to be seized and should have been quashed by the trial court as a general warrant. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that the search warrant was constitutionally sound because the items to be seized were particularly described in the most feasible way possible. The court further held that the judicial officer issuing the search warrant was not required to view the material to be seized in order to establish probable cause, as long as the supporting affidavits were specific and were not merely conclusional. The court also held that the issuing judge need not determine whether the materials in question were obscene beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 24-1.1 (1985). Defendant contended that para. 24-1.1 was so unreasonable as to violate both Federal and State due process. He also contended that he was denied due process when he was prosecuted under para. 24-1.1 rather than Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 24-3.1 (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges were based upon defendant's knowing possession of a shotgun, a sawed-off baseball-bat bludgeon, and three pool-cue sections. In 1982, defendant had been convicted of the felony of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. In affirming the conviction by the trial court, the court held that the facts did not support a finding that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 24-1.1 (1985) was unconstitutional. Defendant was convicted of a felony less than three years before the charged offenses. Even if the statute was considered overbroad, as applied under the circumstances it was not unconstitutional. The court also rejected defendant's argument that he was denied equal protection and due process as his possession of a shot gun was prosecuted under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 24-1.1 rather than under section Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 24-3.1. The statutory scheme did not violate equal protection, provided no undue discretion to the prosecution, and did not invalidly delegate authority.

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 122-1 et seq. (1985) (act). Defendant contended that the act provided that the trial court had to determine the frivolity or lack of merit of the petition before appointing counsel, which prejudiced defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A trial court convicted defendant of murder and armed robbery. Defendant filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief and claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his lawyer did not make an effort to check alibi evidence and witnesses. Defendant requested a hearing and counsel. More than 30 days later and without appointing counsel a different trial court denied the petition without stating factual findings because defendant's claim set forth no grounds for legal relief. The court found that the 30-day requirement of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 122-2.1(a) was directory rather than mandatory. However, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that defendant's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel were not frivolous or patently without merit. Moreover, the court found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, par. 122-2.1, the rule that required trial court's to make their frivolity ruling before it appointed counsel during post-conviction proceedings, conflicted with Ill. Sup. Ct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee filed a complaint and an amended complaint in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois) for a declaratory judgment that he was discharged from his probationary position with defendant employer, a city, in violation of article IX, &sect; 3, of the Personnel Rules of the City of Chicago. The employee appealed from the dismissal of his lawsuit due to his failure to state a cause of action upon which relief could have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was discharged from his position as a probationary employee in the employer's department of public works because he allowed a disparaging comment to remain in cement that was finished by the employee. The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's judgment that dismissed the second count of the amended complaint because the employer's personnel rules and ordinance were proper exercises of its home rule power. Thus, the employer was not bound by any conflicting personnel standards in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 10-1-14 (1985). The court held that the trial court erred when it dismissed the remainder of the complaint because the employee alleged that the employer's personnel rules did not authorize it to discipline the employee by suspension and then to discipline him a second time for the same misconduct. Although the employee was on probation and his employment was terminable without cause, the employer could not have terminated the employee unless the employer followed its own procedures. The court held that the amended complaint did not allege a federal due process claim and that a claim for attorney fees was not ripe.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment of the trial court. The court remanded the case to give the employer an opportunity to demonstrate whether any other ordinance or rule authorized the suspension and subsequent discharge of the employee for a single act of misconduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife, through her guardian, filed an action for personal injuries she sustained in an automobile accident allegedly caused by the wilful and wanton misconduct of her husband. The action was dismissed on the grounds that it was barred by the Illinois Interspousal-Immunity Statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 1001 (1985), which barred spouses from suing each other for non-intentional tort injuries. On appeal, the wife claimed that the statute was an unconstitutional violation of equal protection under the federal and state constitutions. The court held that para. 1001 did not burden the marital relationship so directly and substantially as to infringe the fundamental right to marry. The court concluded that the decision to bring suit against one's spouse did not strategically advance the privacy and family interests found to be fundamentally important, nor did para. 1001 constitute a direct legal obstacle to marriage or significantly discourage it.</SPAN></P>

The defense counsel appealed and asserted that the conferences should be permitted on the grounds that the claimants waived their physician-patient privilege when they filed the lawsuit and prohibition of the conferences violated the defense counsel's freedom of speech rights under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that prohibition of ex parte conferences was supported by public policy from the medical code of ethics and fiduciary patient-physician relationship, the discovery process, and the physician-patient privilege under Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 110, para. 8 -- 802. The court held that the order was not violative of freedom of speech rights or an unreasonable time, place, and manner restriction because the state's interest in the confidential and fiduciary relationship outweighed the freedom of speech rights and the discovery process provided an ample alternative to defense counsel to obtain the information he sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim stated that defendant forced his way into her car.

After the sentencing hearing, the trial court denied defendant's motion to withdraw his plea. Affirming, the court held that the trial judge properly considered the victim's impact statement that was included in the presentence report. The court found that the impact statement in the presentence report did have to follow the preparation requirements of sentencing-hearing statements under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-4-1(a)(6) (1985). The court held that the sentence was not an abuse of the trial court's discretion based on the finding that defendant's conduct caused or threatened physical harm. The court found that &quot;bodily harm&quot; as defined by Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-14(a)(2) (1984) was not inherent in the use of force found in criminal sexual assault.</SPAN></P>

The parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that because the purpose of the drainage district was to manage erosion and flooding problems in the drainage district and because the Code had a disproportionate effect on the class that was allowed to vote because of the location of their property, the one-person, one-vote rule was not applicable. Thus, the voting plan set forth in &sect; 4-5 did not violate equal protection under either the Illinois Constitution or the United States Constitution. The court also held that the Code adequately defined a landowner and was not vague and, further, that the landowner and the tenant did not have standing to raise the issue that the Code was unconstitutionally vague because they had not suffered any injury.

The trial court upheld the department's decision. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held that installments from the sale of the hotel that were received after the enactment of the Illinois Income Tax Act were properly taxed even though the sale occurred nine years prior to the effective date of the statute where the gain was actually realized when the payment was received. The court noted that the receipt of payment was the taxable event upon which the tax was levied and that the tax was not directed at payments received before the date of the Act. The court found that the denial of the valuation-limitation deduction under Ill. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city challenged the trial court's dismissal of its complaint for declaratory judgment and injunction against the newspaper to prevent publication of the names, ages, and addresses of crime victims. The newspapers challenged the trial court's judgment as to the constitutionality of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The court affirmed and first addressed the question of whether FOIA exempted the publication of information about crime victims. The newspaper asserted that the information entitled to the exemption from publication had to have been a clearly unwarranted invasion of the victim's privacy. The court held that the legislative intent of FOIA was that the public had a right to know what the government was doing, and that any exemptions were limited. The court held that the city's position on a blanket exemption was not consistent with legislative intent. The court held that FOIA constituted prior restraint on the newspaper's ability to gather news that was not related to a compelling governmental interest. The court found that a case-by-case approach could have been used to protect crime victims from an unwarranted invasion of privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed because the legislative intent of FOIA was that the public had a right to know what government was doing, and that the blanket exemption imposed a prior restraint on the newspaper's ability to gather news that was not related to a compelling governmental interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with driving under the influence of liquor in violation of the village ordinance, which provided for a fine of not less than $ 150 nor more than $ 500, but did not provide for or authorize a jail sentence. Defendant filed a motion to vacate his plea of guilty on the basis that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The village appealed the trial court's grant of defendant's motion. The court found that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 95 1/2, par. 11-501(c) (1983), which provided that every person convicted of violating it should have been guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, evidenced a statutory scheme to remove from home rule units as well as other municipalities the discretion of providing for Class A misdemeanor treatment in their local ordinances for drunken drivers. The court held that the ordinance was invalid for failing to comply with the mandate of the Illinois Vehicle Code.

The standard for determining the legislature's proper exercise of the police power was whether the statute was reasonably designed to remedy the evil which the legislature had determined to be a threat to the public health, safety, and general welfare. The legislature was vested with wide discretion in determining what the public interest required and what means were needed to promote and protect that interest. The purpose of &sect; 24--1.1 was to protect the health and safety of the public by deterring possession of weapons by convicted felons, and this was a proper exercise of the police power.

She contended that the legislation purporting to authorize the assessments was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. First, the court rejected defendant's argument that the charges for the Traffic and Criminal Conviction Surcharge Fund and for Champaign County to finance its court system were taxes that violated the provisions of Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2. The legislation authorizing the charge for the Traffic and Criminal Conviction Surcharge Fund clearly indicated that it was a penal fine and not a tax. Further, the fee to pay for operation of the county court system was imposed as a penalty for violating the law. Finally, the legislation providing for additional fines and penalties to be paid into the Drivers Education Fund and the Violent Crime Victims Assistance Fund was valid.

The trial judge found that the walls needed repainting and subtracted the painter's estimate from the deposit, awarding the tenant the rest plus court costs. On review, the court found the judgment against the manifest weight of the evidence, as the landlords knew about the nail holes before the tenant left but promised the full deposit, and there was no evidence of damage other than normal wear and tear. The court asserted that nail holes were normal wear and tear and should not have been taken from the deposit. The court disagreed that aggregation should extend to landlords owning unrelated structures which, in the aggregate, were 10 or more units, as there was a substantial penalty for landlords who did not comply with the law, too much for small landlords who lacked the large landlord's administrative resources, and harm caused by a dilatory large landlord could greatly exceed any by an isolated small landlord.

The trial court sentenced defendant to an extended sentence pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3.2(b)(3)(i) (1983). Defendant asserted that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing the sentence because the purpose of an extended sentence was to deter criminal conduct and his conduct was not intentional. The court noted that defendant's assertion was essentially that reckless conduct could not be deterred. The court affirmed the judgment. The court based its rejection of defendant's argument on the fact that, by the definition of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 4-6 (1983), recklessness included the conscious disregard of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a result would follow from one's actions. Further, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005-5-3.2 did not require intent, but applied to any felony. Defendant's conviction was a class four felony.

Code &sect; 200.5 et seq. (1984), to be in violation of Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2, pertaining to uniformity on the subjects of taxation, and therefore unconstitutional, void, and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted an ordinance that imposed a tax upon the purchase of alcoholic beverages that were immediately consumed upon the premises where they were purchased. The ordinance did not impose the tax upon the purchase of alcoholic beverages consumed off the premises where they were purchased. Plaintiff alcohol beverage distributors filed an action to have the ordinance declared unconstitutional and to enjoin its enforcement, contending that it was in violation of art. IX, &sect; 2 because it created an arbitrary and unreasonable classification in defining the persons and transactions subject to the tax. The trial court found the ordinance unconstitutional and the city appealed. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that there was no rational basis for the distinction in imposing a tax upon an alcoholic beverage immediately consumed on the premises while not imposing the tax for the purchase of the same alcoholic beverage for the sole reason that it was to be consumed off the premises. The court concluded that the distinction was arbitrary and bore no reasonable relationship to the revenue raising purpose of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were found guilty of murder and armed robbery. On appeal, they claimed that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing each of them a total of only six peremptory challenges during voir dire examination of prospective jurors and in refusing to sever their cases from one another. In affirming, the court held that the antagonism which existed at trial was not the result of inconsistent defenses, but rather, concerned codefendants' pretrial statements, in which each asserted that the other was responsible for the shootings. The jury was properly instructed, however, to only use each defendant's statement against the defendant who made that confession. Accordingly, no severance was required. Also, while the court did not approve of several of the State's comments, the alleged errors were, for the most part, either invited reply to improper comments in defendants' closing arguments or the provoked response to arguments raised by defendants during trial. Further, in light of the evidence presented, defendants failed to demonstrate that the alleged errors unduly influenced the jury so as to constitute a material factor in their convictions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the petition pursuant to &sect; 122 --2.1 as frivolous and without merit. Defendant appealed the dismissal, arguing that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c) and the due process and equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The court reversed the dismissal, holding that defendant's equal protection rights were not violated because there was no disparate treatment between indigent and nonindigent post-conviction petitioners. However, the statute did violate the doctrine of separation of powers in that it directly conflicted with Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c), which required the appointment of counsel at the appellate level for an indigent post-conviction petitioner. Further, the statute violated defendant's due process rights because it denied her adequate, effective, and meaningful access to the courts by allowing a dismissal on the merits, and the consequential application of res judicata, prior to the appointment of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that: (1) the county as a non-home-rule unit of government lacked the authority to enact the ordinance under Ill.

VII, &sect; 10 (1970), and (3) prosecution of county ordinance violations by city attorneys was a conflict of interest and violated the Code of Professional Responsibility. The court rejected defendant's first argument because the counties were given the express power to establish animal pounds and to dispose of stray animals under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 111 1/2, para. 128 et seq. (1985), which concerned pet dogs and cats, and other animals. The grant of authority to dispose of stray animals contained the implied authority to regulate stray animals by less drastic means, such as fines, as provided by the Peoria County ordinance. The court found pursuant to the terms of the Peoria intergovernmental agreement, the attorneys for the city possessed the requisite authority to prosecute defendant, and there was no violation of the Code of professional Responsibility.</SPAN></P>

They sought to have the law declared an unconstitutional occupation tax under Ill. Const. art. VII, &sect; 6, but the trial court held that it was a constitutional transaction tax. On appeal, the court affirmed because the transaction tax was not designed to impose a tax upon the occupation of being a cabdriver, so it was not an occupation tax. The tax was one which some cabdrivers had to pay incidental to their occupation. The practical operation and effect test was not appropriate because the disputed tax was not a service tax. Also, the essence of the lease was the lease of personal property, the taxicab, not the taxi license, the trademarks, or the tradename. Thus, the leases were essentially leases of tangible personal property. The court also upheld Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 24, para. 11- 42-6 (1985) because home rule units should not be denied pre-1970 municipal powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer operated a truck stop where it sold fuel. The taxpayer's accountant realized that the taxpayer had paid retailers' occupation tax and municipal retailers' occupation tax on amounts from fuel sales, which included federal excise tax. The accountant corrected its method of tax calculation and applied to the Department for credits on the taxes. The Department denied the claim, finding that the taxpayer &quot;intended&quot; to collect the excess tax and had not refunded the excess amounts to its customers. The trial court took judicial notice of fuel prices in the area at the time and ruled that the taxpayer bore the economic burden of the excess tax. On appeal, the court ruled that the trial judge erred by taking judicial notice of the fuel prices and that it should have remanded for a determination of that issue, pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 110, para. 3-111(7) (1983). Nonetheless, the uncontradicted evidence established that the taxpayer did not compute the amount of tax applicable to a given fuel sale until after its customers had paid for their fuel. Thus, the excess taxes were not passed on to the taxpayer's customers, and it was thus entitled to a credit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant drive-in theater owner challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Winnebago County (Illinois) that affirmed a decision of a county commission in favor of appellee state. The county commission ruled that the theater owner had violated the county's theater licensing ordinance that regulated the showing of sexually explicit scenes. The theater owner was fined and the theater owner's license was suspended for 30 days.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The theater owner contended that the county ordinance was unconstitutional on its face because it required a theater operator to covenant not to show constitutionally protected movies if they were viewable from certain specified locations. On appeal, the court ruled that the license suspension imposed a prior restraint on the theater owner's freedom of speech without adequate safeguards and it was, therefore, unconstitutional. The portion of the judgment which affirmed the license suspension was reversed. However, the portion of the circuit court's judgment that affirmed the fines assessed against the theater owner was affirmed. The decision of the county commission was not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The county presented the testimony of police officers and people who resided near the theater to the effect that on the dates in question they observed, from the locations specified in the ordinance, sexually explicit scenes. That testimony was sufficient to sustain the county commission's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in favor of the state insofar as it affirmed the fines assessed against the theater owner.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court at the transfer hearing determined that it was not in the best interests of defendant and the public to proceed with the juvenile proceedings against him.

The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 702 -- 7(3) (1983) in transferring defendant to be tried as an adult. The court found that there was strong evidence that defendant was involved in the charged offenses, and the security of the public required that he be held in custody for a period extending beyond the age of minority. The court rejected defendant's contention that the mandatory life imprisonment imposed on him under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005 -- 8 --1(a)(1)(c) (1983) violated his due process rights. The court further held that the lack of a provision in the sentencing statute to include the trial court's consideration of evidence in mitigation did not violate defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV.</SPAN></P>

He was sentenced on the latter charge to 25 years' imprisonment, and a $ 3500 &quot;street value fine&quot; was imposed. On appeal, the court was convinced that the evidence was sufficient to exclude every reasonable theory of defendant's innocence and prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. However, in sentencing, the court found that the trial court's emphasis on defendant's lack of remorse was misplaced, given that defendant continued to maintain his innocence. Furthermore, the amount of the controlled substance was relevant to the seriousness of the offense, and the 35.1 grams of cocaine found was only slightly in excess of the minimum required to make the offense a Class X felony as opposed to a Class 1 felony. The court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in imposing such a harsh sentence upon defendant. The court also determined that the statute authorizing a &quot;street value fine&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague, and defendant was entitled to credit toward his fine for jail timer served prior to sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a bench trial in the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois), defendant was found guilty of soliciting for a prostitute, in violation of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-15(a)(1) (1983), for which he was sentenced to one year's conditional discharge. Defendant challenged the resulting judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only issue addressed on appeal was defendant's claim that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-15(a)(1) (1983) only prohibited actions of a person, typically a middleman, in seeking customers for a prostitute. Thus, even crediting the State's evidence that defendant attempted to solicit a prostitute for his own use, defendant argued that he did not violate &sect; 11-15(a)(1). Before addressing &sect; 11-15(a)(1)'s meaning, the court rejected the State's claim that defendant had waived the issue because he did not raise it in the trial court, ruling that because his claim challenged the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court, it could be raised for the first time on appeal. With respect to the meaning of &sect; 11-15(a)(1), the court declared that it was necessary to look to the statute as a whole, and because it was subject to differing interpretations, it was helpful to review its legislative history. Moreover, because it was a criminal statute, its provisions were strictly construed. Applying these principles, the court concluded that &sect; 11-15(a)(1) was limited to the acts of a third person in soliciting customers for a prostitute and thus, did not prohibit defendant's actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The government brought civil action for bid rigging and conspiracy to conduct an unreasonable restraint of trade. The trial court dismissed the complaint because the statute of limitations had run and failure to state a cause of action. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred when it concluded the statute of limitations began to run when the rigged bids were submitted. The illegal act charged in the complaint was conspiracy to fix prices that continued at least until the defendants transferred a payment. This action was filed within the four-year limitations period and therefore was not time barred. It appeared from the nature of the proposed amendments that the inadequacies in pleadings found by the trial judge were curable, so dismissal was reversed. Regarding a prior discovery order, the court further found that the attorney general was not prohibited from using pre-complaint subpoenaed deposition material.</SPAN></P>

The court held that instructions regarding inferences and presumptions related to the blood-alcohol testing were appropriate. The jury had been properly instructed as to its duties, the charge made against defendant, the presumption of innocence, the issues, and the burdens of proof. Also, the blood-alcohol content was not the only evidence submitted by the State concerning defendant's driving while under the influence. The arresting and backup officers' corroborating testimony was entirely adequate to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty. There was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to find defendant guilty.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee ex wife filed suit against appellant ex husband to obtain a modification of a child-support order. Finding that the ex wife had shown a substantial change in circumstance, the Circuit Court for Cook County (Illinois) ordered an increase in monthly child-support payments pursuant to &sect; 505(a) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 40, para. 505(a). The ex husband appealed the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex husband argued that &sect; 505(a) violated various provisions of the Federal and State Constitutions. The ex husband's constitutional challenge was based on the erroneous assumption that, under &sect; 505(a), courts were mandated to follow literally the schedule for child support. In rejecting the ex husband's argument that &sect; 505(a) violated the separation-of-powers requirement of Ill. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, or Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, the court held that the child support guidelines involved application of substantive law and were not an incursion into the power of the judiciary. The court further held that &sect; 505(a) was consistent with constitutional standards in Ill. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13 in that it was a general law that operated equally among divorced parents. The court found that the procedural protections afforded to the ex husband in the trial court far exceeded any which were constitutionally required and, therefore, &sect; 505(a) did not deprive the ex husband of procedural due process under both the Federal and State Constitutions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured sued the insurer and alleged that the insurer refused to pay a valid claim on a policy of fire insurance. In one of the counts, the insured sought exemplary damages of one million dollars for the insurer's bad-faith conduct. The insurer moved to dismiss the count, and the trial court granted the motion. The insured challenged the decision, and argued that the statute deprived them of their right to trial by jury to determine the proper amount of punitive damages. The court affirmed the decision, and held that under the statute the trial court alone was to determine the proper measure of punitive damages, within the given limits pursuant to Ill. Rev. Stat. 1983, ch. 73, para. 767. However, where punitive damages may be assessed, they were allowed in the nature of punishment and as a warning and example to deter a defendant from committing like offenses in the future. Therefore, the insured could not complain of any deprivation of their rights when punitive damages were assessed by a court.</SPAN></P>

The citizens gathered signatures on a petition in an effort to veto the tax under &sect; 9 of the Act. After the city held that the citizens failed to obtain the requisite number of signatures to overturn the ordinances, the citizens brought an action for a declaratory judgment that ordinances were invalid. The circuit court entered an order granting the city's motion to dismiss the complaint. The court affirmed the order, holding that the citizens failed to allege sufficient facts that could, if proved, support the citizens' claim that the city did not comply with the requirements of the Act by (1) failing to file a map of the area with the county clerk; (2) failing to file the levy ordinance by the statutory deadline; and (3) determining that the petition did not include the necessary signatures.

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 17-1(B)(d) (1983). Defendant sought review of his conviction, arguing that the state had not met its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court reversed. The court found that defendant gave the seller a check to cover the cost of goods and that there were sufficient funds in defendant's account to cover the check when written. The court further found that defendant's conviction was based on an inference of intent to defraud. The court held the inference inapplicable in this case. The court said that an inference of guilt could have been drawn from proven facts if there was a rational connection between the proven fact and the inferred fact, the inferred fact more likely than not flowed from the proven fact, and the inference was supported by corroborating evidence. The court found that the state had not produced any corroborating evidence that supported the inference of intent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that: (1) his conviction for aggravated criminal sexual assault required reversal because the sex assault law of which his offense was a part was so unreasonable in its definitions and applications as to violate the due process clauses of the United States and Illinois Constitutions; (2) he should not have been convicted of attempted murder; and (3) the trial court did not grant him the proper number of days against his sentence. Upon review, the court held that defendant should not have been convicted of armed violence, and that the trial court did not grant defendant the proper number of days against his sentence. The fact that defendant stabbed the victim four times in rapid succession, that there were no intervening acts or events, that there was a single victim, and that all of the stabbings occurred at the same location led to the conclusion that defendant's conduct gave rise to only one offense.

In affirming on appeal, the court held that: (1) the ordinance was unambiguously a taxing measure with the purpose of raising revenue, it did not govern the time, place, or manner of the sale of leaded gasoline, and the penalties and fines imposed for failure to comply did not convert the ordinance into a regulatory measure; (2) as the ordinance was not a regulatory measure regulating clean air, no federal preemption occurred; (3) the tax uniformly applied to all purchasers of leaded gas and thus did not violate the uniformity provision of Ill. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (1970); (4) discouraging the sales of leaded gas was a rational basis for imposing the tax; and (5) that environmental matters were of statewide concern did not prohibit Chicago, a home rule city, from enacting a consumer tax.</SPAN></P>

Under the Juvenile Court Act (Act), defendant was automatically tried as an adult. After a bench trial, the court found defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 702-7(6)(c) provided that when a juvenile who was tried as an adult was convicted of a lesser offense, the trial court had discretion to sentence defendant under the Act or under general criminal statutes. The trial court sentenced defendant under general Illinois criminal law. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence. The court affirmed and held that the state's reference to defendant's prior criminal history in the grand jury proceedings was not error because grand juries did not have the same technical rules concerning evidence as trials did. The state did not misinform the grand jurors about the legal standard for murder. The Act's distinction between treating defendants of a certain age as adults was not a violation of defendant's equal protection and due process rights. The trial court demonstrated that it considered the factors set out in Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 37, para. 702-7(3)(a) when it sentenced defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court found that para. 7-10(c) did not violate equal protection because the State had a valid interest in limiting ballot access to serious candidates, a minimum signature requirement was a constitutional means to do so, and the statute applied equally to all people seeking to run for sheriff. The fact that those seeking to run for judge had lower signature requirements did not violate equal protection. Further, the requirement that the candidate collect one-half of one percent of the qualified electors of his party cast at the last general election in his county was not so onerous a burden as to deny the candidate's first amendment and due process rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered the home of an elderly victim and assaulted her, although defendant did not plead guilty to sexual assault. Defendant contended that the indictment was insufficient because it did not contain an allegation that he used force.

Defendant contended that the circuit court improperly relied on prejudicial and hearsay evidence of other crimes or bad conduct in sentencing. On appeal, the court affirmed in large part. The challenge to the indictment was waived by the voluntary guilty plea. Further, defendant stipulated to an amended indictment that added the use of force language. Defendant waived the voluntariness issue by the failure to raise it below. The constitutionality of the burglary statute was upheld in case law. The sentencing issue failed because the circuit court was not confined to the evidence at the guilty plea, and further, any error was harmless. However, defendant was improperly ordered to pay restitution because the circuit court did not admonish him on the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in cocaine sales with her ex-husband. The ex-husband contacted the Metropolitan Area Narcotics Squad (MANS) because of alleged concern about the children. MANS began an investigation. Defendant was convicted of delivery of a controlled substance and the possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. She contended that a MANS agent and her ex-husband entrapped her into dealing drugs. On appeal, the court held that the entrapment defense failed because defendant's alleged fear and reluctance to deal drugs were not controlling when she independently gave the agent drugs on several occasions. Defendant used cocaine and had knowledge of drug terminology and equipment. The mandatory fine of Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 1005 -- 9 -- 1.1 (1983) was not repealed by implication. Further, the statute was constitutional even if it contained no provisions related to a defendant's financial situation. The agent properly established the street value of the cocaine. However, defendant was actually convicted of a lesser amount, and the fine was reduced. Whether the circuit court could have ordered restitution to MANS was waived by the failure to object.</SPAN></P>

The court retroactively applied the 12-month statute of limitations of the amendment to the adoption statute, Ill. Rev.

The mother urged the court to begin the time tolling when she discovered the adoptive parents were not going to honor the oral agreement. The court found the purpose of the adoption act was to promote stable family relationships free from unnecessary intrusion and this purpose would be frustrated by applying the discovery rule. The court held the mother was not denied due process because the statute of limitations was reasonably related to the state's interest.

The store required a &quot;browsing&quot; fee, which the officer paid to defendant, who was working there. When defendant saw the officer dictating into a tape recorder, defendant asked the officer to leave. Based on his observations, the officer obtained a search warrant. A search was conducted, and defendant was charged and convicted of selling obscene materials. Defendant appealed, and argued that the search warrant affidavit was insufficient, that there was no evidence that defendant offered the magazines for sale, that he lacked the required scienter, and that the statute, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20, was unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the affidavit was sufficient to show probable cause that the magazines were obscene. The magazines were clearly for sale. There was sufficient evidence to show that defendant knew the contents of the store and was prepared to sell those contents. Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 11-20 was not unconstitutional because the definition of &quot;prurient&quot; interest was a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, not a normal sexual curiosity.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 20-1.1(a)(1), (3) (1983) and aggravated battery under Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 12-4(a) (1983), following a bench trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 20-1.1(a)(1) (1983) of the aggravated arson statute was unconstitutional and that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing his attorney to represent him while under a per se conflict of interest, thus depriving him of his right to effective assistance of counsel. The court reversed and remanded defendant's convictions and sentences based on a state supreme court decision that held that &sect; 20-1.1(a)(3) was unconstitutional and violated due process because it was overbroad and punished innocent as well as culpable conduct in setting fires. The court applied the reasoning of the supreme court decision and determined that &sect; 20-1.1(a)(1) of the aggravated arson statute was also unconstitutional. In so ruling, the court held that culpable intent was not inherent in the very act of setting a fire or using explosives in a building, knowing that persons are present therein. However, under &sect; 20-1.1(a)(1), as under &sect; 20-1.1(a)(3), an innocent person who committed such acts could be convicted of a Class X felony. The court also concluded that defense counsel had a potential conflict of interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the denial of his post-conviction appeal by the Circuit Court of Cook County (Illinois). Defendant's convictions for attempted murder, two counts of aggravated battery and armed violence, Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, paras. 8 -- 4, 12 -- 4(a), 12 -- 4(b)(1), 33A -- 2 (1979) were affirmed pursuant to Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 23, 87 Ill. 2d R. 23. Subsequently, his county public defender withdrew as counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pro se filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which was dismissed as frivolous. On appeal, the court affirmed because defendant did not overcome the strong presumption that the applicable statute, &sect; 122 -- 2.1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 (Code), Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 38, para. 122 --2(a) (1983 Supp.) was constitutional. The court found that the circuit court was not required to include written findings of fact and conclusions of law in it's decision despite the Code's use of the word &quot;shall&quot; because the context and statutory purposes required the statute to be permissive. Otherwise the statute would violate separation of powers principles by intruding on the court's exercise of judicial discretion. The court found that Ill. Sup. Ct. R. 651(c), 87 Ill. 2d R. 651(c) did not apply because that rule required the appointment of counsel in post-conviction matters only in the appellate court. The Code did not violate the doctrine of equal protection because defendant was not similarly situated to someone pursuing a direct appeal and did not violate defendant's due process rights because the state was not required to provide counsel on discretionary appeals.</SPAN></P>

Later, defendant appeared and appealed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county brought an action in the Circuit Court of Kane County (Illinois) seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction restraining defendant Illinois State Labor Relations Board (Board) from proceeding on a petition by defendant union requesting a representation election for deputy circuit clerks. After the injunction was granted, the Board and union appealed; and the circuit clerk cross-appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union representing deputy circuit clerks filed a representation petition with the Board, and the county obtained an injunction preventing the Board from proceeding on the petition. In reversing the injunction, the court held that the county's claim that &quot;appointees&quot; were not &quot;employees&quot; for purposes of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (PLRA) (Ill. Rev. Stat. ch. 48, para. 1601 et seq. (1984 Supp.) was without support in the statute. The legislature intended the term &quot;employee&quot; to include persons appointed to positions. The offices of the chief judge and circuit clerk could only have been deemed to be authorities of the State of Illinois, and insofar as they acted as employers in their official capacities they were persons acting within the scope of their authority on behalf of the state in dealing with its employees. Therefore, to the extent that the chief judge or circuit clerk might have been employers of the deputy circuit clerks, they were public employers and the deputy circuit clerks public employees under the PLRA. The court concluded that the PLRA was valid on its face and that any separation of powers defect in the statute would only occur in its application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the injunction dissolved. On the court's own motion, the cause was certified to the Supreme Court of Illinois as involving questions of such importance that they should be decided by that court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cable company constructed cable lines across the property owners' land despite learning that it had no easement to do so.

The lower court awarded damages to the property owners, refused to order the removal of the equipment, and ordered the cable company to raise its lines. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The court determined that although it was satisfied that the cost of removing the equipment from the land was great and that the benefit to the property owners of doing so was small, the cable company's encroachment upon the land was intentional. The court found that the cable company admitted it had no right to be on the property owners' land, the property owners protested early on in the construction, and the cable company persisted in completing the very structure it subsequently claimed was too expensive to move. The court also concluded that, contrary to the cable company's claims, injunctive relief against illegal appropriation of property could not be defeated by any claim that the public interest required it.</SPAN></P>

It was during that stop that defendant fled into an open field, only to be apprehended at a later date. The police found a camera and film in the car that matched the items reportedly missing from the complainant's home.

The court further found that contrary to defendant's contention, the prosecutor's comments on the credibility of certain witnesses was permissible when the comments were drawn from facts in evidence or when the comments constituted reasonable inferences drawn from those facts.
