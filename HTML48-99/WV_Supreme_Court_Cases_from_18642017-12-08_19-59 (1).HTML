<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court of Logan County (West Virginia), which denied his motion for a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no merit in defendant's contention that he should not have been charged and convicted of the malicious assault of the victim. Defendant asserted that because he did not know the victim was in the building, he could not have the requisite intent to assault him as required under W. Va. Code &sect; 61-2-9(a). The court found that even though defendant did not intend to hurt the victim, under the doctrine of transferred intent, he could be charged and convicted of malicious assault. The court determined that the record was inadequate to resolve defendant's ineffective assistance claims. Finally, the court rejected defendant's assertion that because his first degree murder conviction was premised on the felony murder rule, the trial court violated the double jeopardy provisions of both the federal and state constitution when it convicted and sentenced him for the underlying offense of arson. The court held that defendant's arson conviction was unconstitutional and that he was improperly separately sentenced on this offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed, in part, reversed, in part, and remanded.

Code &sect; 60A-4-401(a) by &quot;knowingly, intentionally, unlawfully, and feloniously&quot; delivering a controlled substance by prescribing the substance even though it was not necessary in the medical treatment and care of the purported patient, sufficiently stated the elements of the offense; (2) the jury instructions did not shift the burden of proof to defendant to show his entitlement to the &quot;course of professional practice&quot; exception from culpability under W. Va. Code, 60A-4-401(a) (1983); (3) the evidence sufficiently showed that the prescriptions were issued intentionally for an illegitimate purpose; (4) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of other prescriptions written by defendant; and (5) the count of the indictment alleging a felonious constructive delivery insufficiently charged that offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant tax assessor refused appellee banks' protest, appellant tax commissioner issued taxability ruling 89-5, stating that the banks' personal property was taxable as Class IV property and that the value of the property not realized in the ad valorem taxation of each bank's stock was to be taxed as Class IV property. The Circuit Court of Nicholas County (West Virginia) reversed taxability ruling 89-5. Appellants sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tax assessor asked the banks to supply him with information about the tangible personal property owned by them for the purpose of separate assessment and taxation of that property as Class IV property. The banks returned the requested forms under protest. In taxability ruling 89-5, the tax commissioner rejected the banks' protest. However, the circuit court reversed taxability ruling 89-5. In the instant appeal, the court affirmed because tangible personal property owned by the banks could not be separately taxed in addition to the tax on the banks' shares of stock. The court reasoned that taxability ruling 89-5 attempted to impose double tax liability on the banks, contrary to W. Va. Const., art. X, &sect; 1 and W. Va. Code, &sect;&sect; 11-3-12 (1972) and 11-3-14 (1933). Therefore, the commissioner was taxing banks on their full value before taxability ruling 89-5 was issued. To prevent double taxation, the banks were provided with a credit for the real property taxes that they paid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court were certified questions from the Circuit Court of Morgan County (West Virginia). The circuit court had denied petitioner judge's motions for summary judgment in the civil action filed by respondent attorney seeking damages for defamation and violation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The circuit court held that judicial immunity did not apply and that the attorney's reputation was a valid property interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney contended that the judge defamed him when he issued an order to show cause under W. Va. Code &sect; 30-2-7 (1931), which was obsolete. The first three certified questions called upon the court to determine whether the judge enjoyed judicial immunity if he 1) knew, 2) should have known, or 3) subsequently learned that the statute was obsolete. The court answered these questions in the affirmative, holding that the issuance of the order was done in the judge's judicial capacity and that judges in West Virginia were absolutely immune from suit for the results of any judicial act performed by them while acting in their official capacity. The fourth certified question presented the issue of whether the judge, who provided the order to a newspaper reporter prior to its filing, waived judicial immunity. The court answered the question in the negative, holding that there was no cause of action against the judge for the publication of an order that was part of a public record. The fifth question involved an interpretation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court answered this question in the negative, holding that the attorney did not have a property or liberty interest in his reputation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the circuit court with instructions to grant the judge's motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds of judicial immunity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff auto passengers appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Nicholas County (West Virginia), which granted summary judgment to defendants, highway department and commissioner, because the auto passengers' action for improper construction of the roadway was barred by the statute of repose contained in W. Va. Code &sect; 55-2-6a. The auto passengers raised the certified question that the statute violated W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The auto passengers were injured when the car in which they were riding collided with a truck on a hazardous roadway. They settled their claims against the drivers, but the highway department and commissioner sought summary judgment on the ground that the claims against them were barred by the 10 year statute of repose in W. Va. Code &sect; 55-2-6a. After the trial court granted summary judgment, the auto passengers challenged the constitutionality of the statute by certified question. The court held that the statute was constitutional under W. Va. Const. art III, &sect;&sect; 10, 39, 17. The purpose of the statute was to protect architects and builders from increased exposure to liability. Because the statute of repose affected solely economic rights, the court accorded it considerable deference. The statute did not offend the due process clause of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 17 because it was rational and bore a reasonable relationship to a proper government purpose. Further, due process principles did not prevent the creation of new causes of action or the abolition of old ones to attain proper legislative objects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county solid waste authority filed a petition for a writ of prohibition against the DNR, arguing that the DNR lacked statutory authority to allow the transport company to continue to dispose of more than 9,999 tons of solid waste without a Class A permit. The county solid waste authority also sought a writ of mandamus, directing that in the future the DNR carry out its mandatory duties under W.Va. Code &sect;&sect; 20-5F-4(a) and 20-9-12c. The court granted the writ of prohibition because the permit granted by the DNR was declared void ab initio pursuant to a settlement agreement with the county commission. The court held that the mandamus was appropriate to ensure that the DNR executed its statutory responsibilities and did not authorize the transport company to dispose of more than 9,999 tons of solid waste per month at the county landfill until the transport company met the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and received a valid Class A permit.</SPAN></P>

The Department was required to inform the junior driver of the procedures that the driver had to take to avail himself or herself of the hearing mechanism.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence to life imprisonment from the Jefferson County Circuit Court (West Virginia) for burglary based upon a jury conviction of recidivism pursuant to the West Virginia Habitual Criminal Statute,&nbsp;W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 61-11-18 to -19 (1943). The circuit court also sentenced defendant to an indeterminate term of 1 to 10 years for grand larceny and ordered that the sentences run consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury returned guilty verdict on the burglary and grand larceny charges, the prosecutor filed a recidivist information charging defendant as an habitual criminal. The underlying felonies for the information included convictions for sodomy, breaking and entering, grand larceny, and the instant convictions for burglary and grand larceny. At trial, the jury determined that defendant was the person convicted of those crimes. The trial court directed a verdict for defendant on the sodomy conviction, since the State offered no evidence identifying defendant as the same person who committed that offense. The trial court denied defendant's motion for a new trial and sentenced him. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's most recent convictions for burglary and grand larceny were crimes that by their very nature involved the threat of harm or violence to innocent persons, even though the victim was not at home at the time. Thus, the trial court's imposition of a life sentence pursuant to the Habitual Criminal Statute neither violated the proportionality doctrine nor constituted cruel and unusual punishment as prohibited by the West Virginia and United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court held that W. Va. Code &sect; 60A-2-210 (1987) was unconstitutional because the pharmacy board, which recommended an amendment to &sect; 60A-2-210, failed to follow the procedures outlined in W. Va.

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded the action. The court noted that Va. Code &sect; 60A-2-210 (1987) was clear and unambiguous. The court further noted that the alleged procedural problems with the pharmacy board's recommendations did not make &sect; 60A-2-210 unconstitutional because the legislature properly adopted the amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant putative wife challenged an order from the Circuit Court of Harrison County (West Virginia), which granted appellee putative husband's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted in the wife's action to enforce marital promises between the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative wife claimed that the promises that she and the putative husband made to each other were enforceable contracts, and that she was entitled to acknowledgement and enforcement of those promises by the court. The court disagreed and it answered the wife's certified question in the negative. The court said that although it empathized with the wife, the law would not recognize the agreement between parties based on their agreement to hold themselves out as husband and wife, where the husband was already married under the law to a different person, and where the putative wife knew of that marriage. Moreover, the court said that a contract between a man and a woman under which the two agree to hold themselves out as husband and wife, the woman agrees to cohabit, keep house and entertain friends, while the man agrees to support the woman and take care of her for life, amounts to a contract of common-law marriage which was not valid in West Virginia. To enforce such a contract when one party was already married would amount to the condonation of bigamy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the order dismissing the case on the husband's motion was affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court concluded that under W. Va. Code &sect; 18-5-13a, the exclusive authority to close and to consolidate schools was vested in county boards of education, and that the State Board had no constitutional or legislative authority to disapprove or overrule such decisions. It also concluded that the State Board's decision not to approve the closure of a school was arbitrary and capricious. It permanently enjoined the State Board from taking any action to obstruct or otherwise impede the County Board from closing the school. On appeal, the court concluded that the State Board was empowered to approve or disapprove a school consolidation and closure plan adopted by a county board of education under &sect; 18-5-13a. The court held that the county boards of education did not have unlimited power to make the final decisions with respect to school closings and consolidations because &sect;&sect; 18-5-13 and 18-5-13a reflected that such decisions were to be rejected where they failed to comply with statutory provisions or State Board regulations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged a final order of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), which ruled that he had forfeited his public pension due to &quot;less than honorable service,&quot; under the Disqualification for Public Retirement Benefit Plans (Act), W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 5-10A-1 to 5-10-A-10 (1976). Appellee, the West Virginia Public Employee Retirement System (PERS), sought the determination after the employee had pled guilty to a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court determined that the employee had forfeited his pension because his felony conviction caused his public service to be &quot;less than honorable service,&quot; within the meaning of the Act. The employee claimed that he should be denied only the portion of the pension for the period after he committed the felony. The court upheld the circuit court's total forfeiture of the public pension. He also claimed that the Act was unconstitutional as cruel, unusual, and disproportionate punishment, that it was a bill of attainder, an impairment of contract, and a deprivation of property without due process of law or as a forfeiture of estate. The court rejected these claims, noting that the Act predated the felonious conduct and applied only to conduct occurring on or after it was enacted. As to the impairment of contract claim, the court noted that in a contributory pension plan, such as the PERS plan, the pensioners' rights vest only when all conditions entitling them thereto have been fulfilled. He never fully earned the pension because he did not comply with the condition of honorable service at all times. Consequently there was no substantive due process violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the final order of the circuit court determining that the employee's public service was &quot;less than honorable,&quot; and that he had forfeited his entire retirement pension.

The court held that as applied to the parties' case, &sect; 33-12A-3 was unconstitutional. On remand to the circuit court, the former employee sought to amend his complaint. The circuit court granted summary judgment to appellees regarding the former employee's wrongful discharge and age discrimination claims and denied the former employee's motions to amend his complaint. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment. The court held in part that the dismissal of the age discrimination claim was proper, as the former employee failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination as required by the Act, W. Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his incest conviction, raising several assignments of error leading to his conviction. The court on review affirmed. The court held that a videotaped interview containing a prior inconsistent statement by a defense witness who claimed to have been under duress when making the statement or coerced into making the statement was admissible into evidence as (1) the contents assisted the jury in deciding the witness' credibility with respect to the alleged duress or coercion; (2) the jury received limiting instructions that the tape was admitted solely on the issue of credibility; and (3) the probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect. As the tape was not admitted as substantive evidence, its admission did not give rise to improper admission of collateral crimes evidence. There was no appearance of impropriety in the prosecutor's representation of the state to require her recusal. Failing to show that the method of jury selection was unconstitutional, it was no error to excuse prospective jurors for their religious beliefs.

A dispute arose when the surface owner leased the oil and gas rights to the lessee, who then assigned the lease for drilling. The mineral rights therefrom were sold by the assignee to the oil company and the gas company. The mineral rights owner brought suit. The lower court found in favor of the mineral rights owner, less the reasonable cost of production. The court affirmed, holding that the predecessor of the surface owner possessed the surface only. The predecessor may have paid taxes on the oil and gas estate for more than five years, but he did not ever take possession thereof by drilling or producing a well. The predecessor did not obtain good title to the oil and gas estate by any of the three ways outlined in W. Va. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's operating license was revoked after he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. Prior to his second violation, the legislature passed W. Va. Code &sect; 17C-5A-2 (1986), which permitted the commissioner of the department to revoke an operating license for up to 10 years if the license had been revoked previously. After his second violation, the driver's license was revoked for 10 years and he appealed. The trial court agreed that the statute was unconstitutional and held that a six-month revocation was proper. The department appealed and the court held that the order in which events transpired, including the driver's violations and the enactment of &sect; 17C-5A-2, did not give rise to a violation of ex post facto principles. The court noted that the driver, as of the enactment of the statute, was put on notice that if he drove a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, his license to operate a motor vehicle could be revoked. The court also noted that it was clear that the legislature intended to permit the commissioner, in an administrative proceeding, to consider previous suspensions and revocations in determining the length of a revocation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot his family and tried to kill himself. He was convicted by a jury of first degree murder. The jury made no recommendation for mercy, so defendant was automatically sentenced to life without parole. Defendant filed three petitions in three courts to challenge his conviction. On his fourth petition for a writ of habeas corpus, a circuit court conducted a hearing and then dismissed the petition. Defendant appealed the dismissal of his petition. On appeal, he argued that he had been entitled to full appellate review on the merits of his conviction. The court explained that criminal defendants had no such right under state law, the state constitution, or the federal constitution. Due process did not encompass the right to full appellate review; it did require that criminal defendants have the right to petition an appellate court for discretionary review under W. Va. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 4 and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10 and &sect; 17. When West Virginia created a method for conducting criminal appeals with discretionary elements, it was required to comport with due process in carrying it out.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and malicious wounding. Defendant contended that the trial court (1) erred in failing to grant a mistrial for jury tampering; (2) committed reversible error by allowing Ferguson inferences to be used in light of defendant's constitutional right to bear arms; and (3) in charging the jury so as to unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof. Defendant also asserted that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and that there as insufficient evidence to support the verdict. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding that defendant failed to show prejudice by a witness contacting a juror during deliberations and that the rule that malice may be inferred from the intentional use of a deadly weapon did not violate the right to bar arms pursuant to W.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On January 31, 1983, the taxpayer sold 607,653 shares of stock in a company and realized substantial capital gains. Shortly thereafter, the West Virginia Legislature passed Senate Bill 310 (effective April 1, 1983), which (1) raised the West Virginia Personal Income Tax rates applicable to the taxpayer by 3.4 percent and (2) added a temporary 12-percent surtax for individuals with West Virginia taxable income in excess of $ 10,000. As a result, the taxpayer filed a state income tax return that used a lower tax rate to compute his liability for the income earned from the capital gain. However, the Commissioner notified the taxpayer that his return did not take into account the higher tax rates and the surtax imposed by 11-21-3. In the instant appeal of the taxpayer's tax refund claim, the court held that the surtax enacted by W. Va. Code, 11-21-4e (1983) explicitly applied to income earned in 1983 on a prorated basis under the provisions of W. Va. Code, 11-21-4e (1983). Moreover, although the effect of the 1983 rate changes in the taxpayer's case was harsh, it was not unconstitutionally retroactive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was the assignee of the original contract executed by the client, which provided for a contingency fee of 25 percent in services provided with respect to his claim for worker's compensation disability benefits. The attorneys had provided services a number of different times over a period of almost 20 years. During that time, the law on recoverable attorney fees was amended several times, reducing the amount an attorney could receive. The court looked at the 1975 statute and read it to ratify all contracts that would have been legal in 1974. Those contracts would have contained a provision for payment that covered a 208-week limitation and a percentage between 20 and 25 percent. As applied to the contract at issue, this meant that the contract's provisions allowing a percentage fee beyond 208 weeks of benefits were unenforceable. The percentage recovery, however, remained in force. The reduction in the attorney's fee under the original contract did not violate his rights U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10.

The court held that the applicant had firsthand knowledge that the one member's eligibility was the issue of a pending civil action and that any action taken by the board might not be valid if such member cast the deciding vote on the issue of the superintendent position. The court reasoned that the rule that any act of an officer de facto that was performed prior to his removal from office was valid, W. Va. Code &sect; 6-5-3, ceased when the person who invoked protection for the act of the de facto officer knew when the act was done that it was not the act of a legal officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, the president of a county board of education, filed an action for a declaratory judgment on whether appellant member was eligible for membership on the board. The member challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Webster County (West Virginia), which declared that pursuant to W. Va. Code, &sect; 18-5-1a (1967), he was ineligible for membership because he was the chairman of the Webster County Republican Party Executive Committee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The member was appointed chairman of the Committee. He was elected to the board. The president of the board believed that the member was ineligible for membership on the board and filed an action for a declaratory judgment. The circuit court found that because the member was chairman of the Committee he was ineligible for membership on the board. The court affirmed, holding that the circuit court was correct in finding the member ineligible. W. Va. Code, &sect; 18-5-1a (1967) prohibited membership on a county board of education to an individual who was an elected or an appointed member of any political party executive committee. Under W. Va. Code, &sect; 3-1-9, a chairman was selected by the members of a political party executive committee, fell within the ambit of W. Va. Code, &sect; 18-5-1a (1967), and was ineligible to hold office as a member of a school board. The member met those criteria. The preclusion of membership on a county school board to a member of any political party executive committee under &sect; 18-5-1a was not an unconstitutional restriction on the right to run for office under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) even though the female student had graduated from high school, the question on appeal was not moot because a vital public function was involved and repetition of such discrimination was foreseeable; (2) the games of baseball and softball were not substantially equivalent because a substantial disparity existed in the equipment used and in the skill level required, and (3) the commission fell within the definition of &quot;public accommodations&quot; because the commission regulated interscholastic athletics and its membership, all of which had a direct impact on the public school system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was alleged that the former employee's were not employed on the start of the fiscal year, and therefore, not entitled to receive the annual incremental salary increase under by W. Va. Code, 5-5-2 (1984). The court disagreed, holding that the statute did not require employment on the first day of the ensuing fiscal year. Moreover, the statute allowed compensation, as part of regular pay, for services previously rendered. Consequently, the employees were entitled to receive the annual incremental salary increase for that fiscal year. The court ruled that the employees were not entitled to apply accrued sick leave toward extended health insurance coverage or retirement benefits under to W. Va. Code, 5-16-12 (1988). Specifically, the court rejected a contention that the employees were compelled to retire from their public employment. The court determined that the closing of the hospital where the employees worked was based on a systematic reduction of the hospital facility's population. Consequently, the termination from employment was a &quot;reduction in work force&quot; under W. Va. Code, 5-16-12(b) (1988), and the employees were only entitled to the benefits of that section.</SPAN></P>

The court awarded the writ and held that the attorney could avoid appointments based on the ground that the representation was likely to result in an unreasonable financial burden pursuant to W. Va.

Va. Code, 24-2-1b (1988) was unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute gave the PSC authority to set rates and to establish rules and regulations providing for the safe transportation of solid waste in the state. At issue was whether the title to Comm. Sub. H.B. 3146, which enacted the statute, complied with W.Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 30, and imparted enough information to one interested in the subject matter to provoke a reading of the act, or whether, at a minimum, a &quot;pointer&quot; was furnished to W. Va. Code, 24-2-1b (1988). Appellees, as motor carriers, were regulated by the PSC; because they were also landfill operators, they would be interested in Comm. Sub. H.B. 3146. The key was the presence of the reference to the collection of solid waste in the title. Furthermore, the title included a specific reference to the addition of W. Va. Code, 24-2-1b. The combination of the language, &quot;relating generally to collection of solid waste,&quot; with the reference to the addition of W. Va. Code, 24-2-1b, imparted enough information to those interested in the subject matter to provoke a reading of the act.

The Circuit Court of Monongalia County (West Virginia) entered a judgment in favor of the employer, holding that the employee failed to make out a prima facie case of sex discrimination and that the seniority provisions of W.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court improperly denied the employee's request for a jury trial. Because her sexual discrimination claim was a species of personal injury akin to tort, the employee had the right to try to a jury her factual claims that would entitle her to money damages for personal injury. And, the language of the statute that allowed the employee to file her claim in circuit court, W. Va. Code &sect; 5-11-13 (1983), did not prohibit a jury trial. The court also held that the employee offered enough proof of discrimination to bring her claim before a jury. Although the employee had no right to a promotion based on seniority, the fact that she was the most senior person applying would have been one piece of relevant evidence, given the tie-breaking use of seniority in most large organizations. Also relevant was the statistical gender disparity that the employee claimed existed between teachers and administrators in the county. Thus, the employee offered sufficient evidence from which the fact-finder might reasonably have concluded that she had made out a prima facie case of discrimination.

The trial court concluded, as a matter of law, that she was not entitled the habeas corpus relief sought. The trial court determined that the law provided no relief as the mother was the victim of &quot;duress of circumstances,&quot; which was not sufficient to invalidate the relinquishment. The court affirmed on appeal. Pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 48-4-5 (1986), the statutory requirements for relinquishment of legal custody for adoption purposes were met. The statute clearly provided that the consent was irrevocable unless it was proven that the consent was obtained by fraud or duress. There was no evidence that the mother was induced to sign the forms by any unlawful or unconscionable act by anyone from the department. &quot;Duress of the circumstances,&quot; which was simply the emotional situation evident when a mother gave up a newborn for adoption, did not amount to fraud or manipulation and did not warrant revocation of the mother's consent to relinquishment. Finality was in the best interests of the child.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rendered judgment in favor of the PSD for its unpaid sewer fees and concluded that the park was not entitled to any recovery on its counterclaim for the value of its private system. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that where a PSD required the property owner, tenant, or occupant to connect to its sewer system pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 16-13A-9, and to abandon a private sewer system located on the property, such person could not recover from the PSD the value of such private system on the ground that such abandonment constituted a taking of private property without just compensation with the meaning of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 9. The court noted that as early as 1913 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was the commonest exercise of the police power of a state or city to provide for a system of sewers and to compel property owners to connect therewith.</SPAN></P>

The court held that effective July 1, 1990, no lawyer in West Virginia might have been involuntarily appointed to a case unless the hourly rate of pay was at least $ 45 per hour for out-of-court work and $ 65 per hour for in-court work. The court stated that the rates were the minimum compensation constitutionally permissible based upon precedent in the federal system, a calculation of the current purchasing power of the fees established in 1977, and an adjustment due to the court delaying the effective date of its order until July 1, 1990. The court also held that no lawyer in West Virginia might have been required to devote more than 10 percent of his work year to court-appointed cases. The court found that the lawyer proved that he was required to spend more than 10 percent of his time on appointed cases. The court granted the lawyer's prayer to be relieved from further representation in appointed cases, to the extent the appointments exceeded 10 percent of his practice, and granted, as moulded, the writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the indictment was insufficient to support his conviction because it did not allege that the delivery took place &quot;with remuneration.&quot; He claimed that the circuit court erred in not submitting a verdict form that would have allowed the jury to find him guilty of delivery without remuneration and in failing to instruct the jury on intent. He argued that the circuit court abused its discretion in sentencing him. The court found that the indictment was sufficient because it followed W. Va.

The court concluded that the circuit court had abused its discretion in sentencing defendant because it had not considered whether he had a history of involvement with illegal drugs, whether he was a reasonably good prospect for rehabilitation, whether incarceration would serve a useful purpose, and whether available alternatives to incarceration, such as probation conditioned on community service, would be more appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was originally determined that the inmates' conditions of confinement constituted cruel and unusual punishment. Respondents were ordered to submit a plan to bring the conditions of confinement within constitutional standards. The compliance plan did not satisfy the court's requirements and a special master was appointed to approve a revised compliance plan. The revised plan was rejected and the rule to show case was issued. Respondents submitted their response and asserted that the court should not appoint a receiver for the construction of a new penitentiary because the governor and the legislature believed that they would be able to replace the facility by the court's deadline. The court stated that a great deal of emphasis was placed on Senate Bill 389 relating to the West Virginia Regional Jail and Correctional Facility Authority. That was basically a recodification of the provisions of W. Va. Code, 31-20-1 et seq. (1985). However, the court's mandate did not run to the regional jail authority, as it was not a party to the litigation. The court was willing to defer again to accommodate another submission of a plan but the plan had to contain specific proposals.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the statute was constitutional and dismissed the suit as to the city. The claimant appealed and the court reversed because it found that the action was controlled by the holding in O'Neil v. City of Parkersburg, 160 W. Va. 694 (1977), where the provisions of W. Va.

The mother's previous paternity action against the father was dismissed by an agreed order and this action was brought against the father when the child was almost 12 years old.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother instituted a paternity action against the father when the child was three years old. Six months later, the mother agreed to withdraw the action and the case was dismissed. When the child was almost 12 years old, the mother instituted a second paternity suit to obtain child support from the father. The father then raised as a bar the previously dismissed action and the 10-year statute of limitations. The trial court dismissed the action. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that dismissal of the prior action did not prevent the mother from instituting the second action because the mother received no consideration for the dismissal, which was without prejudice. With regard to the statute of limitations, the court deemed it appropriate to utilize the intermediate level of scrutiny to determine whether the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution and W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 39. The court held that the statute was unconstitutional and did not bar the mother's paternity claim.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the plants, defendant was convicted upon his conditional guilty plea. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that seizure of the plants near the chicken coop did not violate the Fourth Amendment or W. Va. Const. Art. III, &sect; 6, because the plants were in an open field. They were not within defendant's curtilage, because the chicken coop was 195 feet from defendant's home, was not enclosed, was being used for illegal purposes, and was not protected from observation. The court further held that the plants near the outbuilding were in plain view, because defendant had no expectation of privacy in areas beyond his curtilage, the police had a right to make a protective sweep of the area, and they had probable cause to believe they would find more marijuana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced by an agreed-to order. After a later dispute, the circuit court clarified the order.

The family law master refused to hear the dismissal motion and recommended the modification. The circuit court adopted the master's recommendations. The wife appealed, and the court reversed. The court found that the family law master lacked jurisdiction to hear a petition for modification that related solely to property under W. Va. Code &sect; 48A-4-1(i)(4) (1986). The court found that &sect; 48A-4-1(i)(4) limited jurisdiction to child custody, child visitation, child support, or spousal support, and the reference to domestic matters in W. Va. Code &sect; 48A-4-1(i)(3) (1986) was unrelated to modification proceedings. The court found that W. Va. Code &sect; 48A-4-2(d) or &sect; 48A-4-11 (1986) were jurisdictional statutes. The circuit court's subject matter jurisdiction in modification was also limited to alimony, child support, or child custody by W. Va. Code &sect; 48-2-15(e) (1986).

The court found that the warrantless search of defendant's pants pockets did not violate his right to be free from an unreasonable search as it was a reasonable and good faith attempt to locate necessary identification of an accident victim, as required by law. Nor did the court find that the trooper's search invaded defendant's reasonable expectation of privacy as defendant's expectation of privacy was diminished due to the reduced ability to control his belongings in the emergency room setting, and his failure to place them in the hospital safe when offered to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former employee appealed the order of the Circuit Court of Logan County (West Virginia) that granted defendant insurer's motion to certify the question of the constitutionality of W. Va. Code &sect; 33-12A-1 et seq. (1984), which prohibited an insurer from terminating the employment of an insurance agent who had been employed by written contract for five or more years, in the former employee's wrongful discharge claim against the insurer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former employee filed an action against the insurer, alleging that he had been wrongfully discharged in violation of W.Va. Code &sect; 33-12A-1 et seq. (1984). The insurer asserted that the newly enacted statute, which prohibited an insurer from terminating the employment of an agent who had been employed by a written contract for five or more years, except for good cause, unlawfully impaired the parties' at-will employment contract and was, therefore, unconstitutional. The circuit court granted the insurer's motion to certify the question. The court held that the statute was an unconstitutional impairment of the parties' existing contractual obligations under U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 and W. Va. Const. art. 3, &sect; 4. Under the former employee's employment contract, the insurer could discharge him at will, upon two weeks' notice. However, the statute required a showing of good cause and severely limited the circumstances in which the former employee could be discharged. The court concluded that that statute was designed to protect insurance agents and that there was no significant and legitimate public purpose that justified state interference with private contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the state statute which prevented an insurer for terminating an agent's employment, except for good cause, was an unconstitutional impairment of the at-will employment contract between the former employee and the insurer because the statute severely limited the circumstances in which the insurer could discharge the former employee, and there was no legitimate public purpose that justified the interference with the contract.</SPAN></P>

The officer did not have probable cause to believe defendant had committed a crime when he initially approached him; the officer did not have probable cause to arrest defendant without a warrant merely because defendant refused to accompany him to the jail.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A pay raise of approximately 7.5 percent was approved for teachers by the school board. The increase was based upon anticipated additional property tax revenues. The law under which the county would have collected the additional revenues was struck down.

The union sought a declaratory judgment that the board's action was improper and violated W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 18-9B-8 (1967) and 18A-4-5 (1969).

The court held that &sect; 18-9B-8 was inapplicable to the action because the budget did not provide for less than a full employment term. Neither did the board violate &sect; 18A-4-5.

The court denied that petition, reasoning that the deputy sheriffs' interest in continued employment did not rise to the level of a constitutionally protected property interest. The court held that because the civil service coverage was an option that was subject to the commission's discretion, the deputy sheriffs only had an expectation of entitlement. The court also concluded that the classification only required a rational basis because the deputy sheriffs' right to continued employment through civil service coverage did not involve constitutional freedoms or sensitive or fundamental rights.

Pursuant to the provisions of the new article, the Board had to submit its approved legislative rules to the oversight commission for review. The court was of the opinion that the relief requested by petitioners should have been granted. The court held that rule-making by the Board was within the meaning of &quot;general supervision&quot; of state schools pursuant to W. Va. Const. art. XII, &sect; 2, and that any statutory provision that interfered with such rule-making was unconstitutional. Consequently, W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 29A-3A-12 and -13 (1988) were thereby declared to be unconstitutional. In light of the court's holding that the Board's rule-making authority was constitutional, the case cited by respondents had no application to the case before the court because the case cited by respondents involved administrative rules promulgated pursuant to a legislative delegation of rule-making power. Petitioners were challenging the constitutionality of W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 29A-3A-12 and -13 (1988). Therefore, mandamus was clearly a proper remedy in petitioners' case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lured a 16-year old boy into his car by falsely identifying himself as a relative of the boy's teacher. Defendant took the boy to a parking lot and offered him money to &quot;treat him right.&quot; Defendant took out a knife and told the boy to remove his pants. The boy escaped after a struggle. About a month later, defendant approached a young woman and offered her money to &quot;show him a good time.&quot; He forced his way into her car by holding a knife at her throat. The woman escaped and found an officer, who arrested defendant. Defendant was charged by separate indictments with two counts of abduction with intent to defile. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court erred in denying defendant's motion for severance of the offenses at trial. The offenses were clearly separate and distinct and were not so similar in nature that evidence of one crime would have been admissible at a separate trial for the other. Moreover, the danger of prejudice to defendant outweighed the convenience to the State of a single trial. Section 61-2-14(a) was not unconstitutionally vague because it was sufficiently definite to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of the prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought to be hired at a coal mine operated by the employer. However, the employer did not hire the applicant based on its doctor's recommendation, which concluded that work in the mine would aggravate the applicant's psoriasis condition. The applicant filed a complaint with the commission alleging discrimination on the basis of her handicap. The commission found in favor of the applicant, but the lower court reversed the commission's decision. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's judgment in part and affirmed it in part. The lower court erred in finding that a prior decision of the court was unconstitutional. The prior decision was constitutional because it merely provided additional hearing examiners to hear the backlog of cases before the commission and did not provide any administrative guidance to the way decisions were to be made. Nonetheless, the West Virginia Human Rights Act (Act), W. Va. Code &sect; 5-11-1 et seq. (1987), did not apply because the applicant was not a &quot;handicapped person&quot; as defined by the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consolidated cases stemmed from a constitutional challenge to the excess levy provisions found in W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 10, which expressly authorized counties to pass excess levies at rates not to exceed 100 percent of the maximum allowable levy rates to help finance the school system. Respondent declared the excess levy provisions to be violative of equal protection principles and determined that dependence on county funds promoted unequal treatment of students in poor and wealthy counties. Petitioners sought a writ to prevent respondent from implementing his remedial order that would withhold a proportion of state school funding from counties with excess levies and distribute the sums withheld equitably to other counties. The court issued a writ of prohibition to permanently restrain and prohibit enforcement of respondent's order. Although education was a fundamental right subject to the equal protection standard, the excess levy provision did not violate equal protection principles because W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 10 expressly authorized such levies. The more recent constitutional amendment for excess levies prevailed over the prior equal protection jurisprudence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, contending that, because the statute under which he was convicted, W.Va.

Defendant's attorney moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that &sect; 61-6-7 had been declared unconstitutional. The trial court overruled the motion.

The court concluded in its prior opinion that the statute destroyed the presumption of innocence and shifted the burden of proof to the defendant, contrary to the basic concept of criminal justice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state bar argued that the attorney collected fees in knowing violation of Department of Labor regulations. The court held that the issue presented was whether the federal limits on attorneys' fees in black lung cases violate the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. V, by effectively denying claimants necessary access to counsel. The court concluded that the Department of Labor system of awarding attorneys' fees did, in fact, severely restrict claimants' ability to find competent lawyers to represent them, and, therefore, the system violated due process. Accordingly, the court found that the attorney was not guilty of any ethical violation for resisting an administrative system that clearly and unambiguously violated U.S. Const. amend. V. Therefore, the court exonerated the attorney.</SPAN></P>

He had raised an alibi defense but had not contended that the offense had not occurred. The conviction was based in part of testimony from a friend of defendant's brother and two other participants, who had pleaded guilty. On appeal, defendant complained of a constitutionally deficient jury instruction, improper rebuttal and summation by the prosecutor, ineffective assistance of counsel, and a disproportionate sentence. The court affirmed the conviction because, while the unobjected to instruction on aggravated robbery improperly omitted an element of the crime the error was not plain error inasmuch as the existence of the crime was not denied. Furthermore, the prosecutor's conduct was within permissible bounds and counsel was not ineffective for failure to object to a proper robbery instruction, although most of the alleged defense deficiencies were not amenable to direct review on appeal. Finally, defendant's life sentence was not disproportionate because he was eligible for parol after ten years.</SPAN></P>

The arrestee was unable to post bond and was incarcerated. The individual posted a cash appearance bond the next morning, and the arrestee was released. The arrestee was found guilty and was fined. Counsel informed the judge that an appeal would be taken and asked that the appearance bond be returned. The judge stated that the appearance bond would only be returned when an appeal bond was posted. The arrestee and individual claimed that the incarceration based on the inability to post bond violated the constitution and that the retention of the cash appearance bond was unauthorized. The court granted the writs. The court held that the right to the equal protection of the laws blocked unequal treatment of criminal defendants based on indigency. The practice of jailing indigents solely because they were unable to post bond violated both statutory and constitutional provisions and had to cease. When final judgment was entered, the condition of an appearance bond was satisfied, and the surety had a right to have any bail deposit returned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Reclamation Board of Review approved a modification to the coal company's mine that allowed the company to create new openings to its underground mine. The circuit court affirmed the decision. The residents objected to the modification because the openings were within 100 feet of a public road and 300 feet of occupied dwellings, in violation of W. Va. Code &sect; 22A-3-22(d)(3), (4). The Commissioner and the Board contended that the exception to the statute subsections applied in this case because the coal company held valid existing rights on the date set out in the statute. On appeal the court held that simply obtaining a lease of mineral rights to an area does not confer valid existing rights upon an operator within the meaning of the Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act. In order to have valid existing rights so as to provide an exception to West Virginia Code &sect; 22A-3-22(d), an operator must have completed its portion of the application process for all the necessary state and federal permits to conduct surface mining in an area contiguous to the proposed operations by the date set out in the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the victim's wife. She was charged with murder but was convicted only for unlawful disinterment of his body. After the victim was shot, he was buried in the backyard in an attempt to conceal the circumstances of his death. A few days later, the body was dug up and dumped in a river so it could be found and given a proper burial. On appeal from her conviction, defendant argued that unlawful disinterment implied disinterment from a decent burial. The shallow grave was described as a hiding place rather than a burial place. The court disagreed, holding that the express language of W.Va. Code &sect; 61-8-14 indicated that it applied to any temporary or permanent burial place. The court also held that the language was sufficiently explicit and was not unconstitutionally vague. There was no error in failing to give a jury instruction defining a principal in the second degree. The distinction between principals in the first degree, principals in the second degree, aiders and abettors, and accessories had been abolished. The trial court's voir dire of the jury panel was not an abuse of discretion and defendant's counsel had indicated that they were satisfied with the panel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1966, defendant broke into a store and stole cigars, cigarettes, and change. Defendant was convicted of breaking and entering. In 1977, the defendant stole copper wire from a railroad. Defendant was convicted of grand larceny. Later that same year, defendant stole a canoe from an unoccupied residence and was convicted of breaking and entering. In 1983, defendant, and several other persons, broke into a store. As they approached the store, someone from inside shot at them. A shoot-out ensued, and during the shoot-out defendant was severely wounded in the right leg. He was later apprehended, tried, and convicted of breaking and entering. The prosecuting attorney, pursuant to the provisions of W.Va. Code &sect; 61-11-18, filed a recidivist information. A recidivist trial was conducted, and at the conclusion of the trial it was determined that defendant had been convicted of the prior crimes and that he was a recidivist.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With respect to the public statements at issue, the court found that they were inappropriate, vexatious, and displayed a lack of professionalism. Moreover, the attorney's conduct in deliberately posing as &quot;Rambo,&quot; with artificially contrived accouterments, was at the least undignified and ridiculous. While the court concluded that the First Amendment Free Speech Clause afforded protection to an attorney's extrajudicial speech, the court remanded the case for a determination of whether the attorney's speech exceeded the scope of protection. As to the other charge, the court held that the Committee misperceived the nature of attorney responsibility under W. Va. D. R. 7-102(A)(1) and 7-102(A)(2). The record revealed an utter lack of a basis in fact for the suit and was strongly suggestive of an improper motivation.

The court held that defendant's freewill was overborne and that the circuit court erred in holding that the confession was voluntary and could be used for any purpose including impeachment. The court determined that the police conduct was egregious, calculated to foment hope or despair in the mind of the accused to any material degree. The court held that a reversal of the conviction was warranted because the circuit court's improper ruling deterred defendant from testifying and violated defendant's right against self-incrimination. Accordingly, the court's erroneous ruling was prejudicial. The court further held that defendant's failure to testify did not waive the constitutional violation.</SPAN></P>

In their action against respondents, the Treasurer and Auditor of the State of West Virginia and the State Superintendent of Schools, the boards sought the state support to which they were entitled to maintain the minimum salary requirements for teachers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the boards had excess levies that were rejected by the voters, the State was required under &sect; 18A-4-5 to consider those excess levies under the equity funding formula. Thus, the teacher salaries dropped below the minimum amount mandated by W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 18A-4-2 and 18A-4-8a (1986). The boards contended that W. Va. Code &sect; 18A-4-5 (1985) was unconstitutional in that it permitted an unequal and discriminatory compensation system by treating counties with excess levies differently from those that had never passed any. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 18A-4-5 violated W. Va. Const. art. XII, &sect; 1. The court held that because education was a fundamental, constitutional right, the State had to demonstrate a compelling state interest to uphold the discriminatory classification. The court found that the system of educational financing in W. Va. Code &sect; 18A-4-5 (1985) awarded state equity funding for salary supplementation purposes based upon whether the county had an excess levy. The court found no justification for the disparate treatment. Furthermore, the allocation system bore no relationship to educational needs.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the budget did not comport with the legislatively established public policy, which was presumed to vindicate the constitutional mandate for a thorough and efficient public school system. The court held that the budget was unconstitutional under W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 51. As an act of comity, the court declined to issue extraordinary writs. So that respondents could give thorough consideration to the efficacy of a petition for rehearing, the operation of the final judgment was suspended for 60 days from the date of judgment. With a petition for rehearing filed in the office of the clerk of the court within the 60 days, the operation of the final judgment was suspended until the further order of the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the indictment on the ground that defendant, a black male, had been denied equal protection as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

In dismissing the appeal, the court found that where the State did not file a petition to appeal with the court within thirty days from the date of the entry of the order dismissing an indictment as required by W. Va. Code, 58-5-30, the appeal would be dismissed as improvidently awarded. W. Va. Code, 58-5-30 authorized them to appeal in limited circumstances. Rule 37(b)(2) of the West Virginia Rules of Criminal Procedure provided that when an appeal by the State was authorized by statute, the petition for appeal had to be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from. The State had no right of appeal in a criminal case except as might be conferred by the Constitution or a statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant along with two companions, was spotted by police at 3:00 a.m. outside a bar in a high-crime area. One of the three was observed to be what appeared to be beer. Defendant disobeyed the police's directive to stay away from his companions' van as the police approached. This lead to defendant's being patted down and to the discovery of a lock-blade knife with a five and one-half inch blade in one of his pockets. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the knife, alleging that discovery of the knife was product of an illegal search. The court found that the police officers were justified in conducting the investigatory stop of defendant and his companions under the circumstances presented and that no violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV or W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 had occurred. Further, the court determined that the scope of the resultant search had been proper under the Terry precedent. However, because the knife involved was not a dangerous or deadly weapon per se under W. Va.

A bond mandamus was brought against the state treasurer to determine whether the treasurer could implement &quot;The Debt Fund Act&quot; (Act), to retire the debt. The court granted the writ. The actions of the State that led to the borrowing of money to fund the employment security program were undertaken pursuant to federal law that was sufficiently coercive to be within the penumbra of the Supremacy Clause and to insulate the actions of the State's executive and legislative branches from West Virginia constitutional challenge in complying with the federal requirements. The Act was constitutional where W. Va. Const., art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to the crime of non-aggravated robbery. He qualified as a youthful offender under W. Va.

While at the center, defendant was charged and found guilty of four infractions of the resident code of conduct. After the fourth charge, the center returned defendant to the circuit court as being unfit to remain at the center. Defendant contended that he was denied due process of law during the determination of his involvement in those infractions that led to his transfer. Upon review, the court found that it was not necessary for defendant to have counsel at the hearings at the center. He did have counsel at the hearing to transfer him from the center, which was all that due process required. The record did not show that the hearing body was not neutral and detached. Defendant was clearly informed what actions constituted his various violations. The reinstated sentence was not grossly disproportionate to the crime, especially as W.Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator detainees, three juveniles, filed suit to obtain a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, county sheriff, county commissioners, and the state department of human services, to permanently release them from confinement in a county correctional center and to transfer them to a juvenile detention center. The juveniles claimed that their confinement in the juvenile detention portion of the center violated minimal standards of confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pending probation modification hearings, a juvenile court ordered that the detainees be temporarily held in the juvenile detention portion of the center. That part of the center was a single room without running water and toilet facilities. Upon the detainees' filing suit, the court issued a rule to show cause against respondents and released the detainees on their own recognizance pending disposition of the case. In granting the writ, the court held that because the center did not have an adequate separate section designed exclusively for detaining juveniles under continuing juvenile court jurisdiction, confinement of the detainees there was illegal. There was no merit to respondents' claim that it was permissible under W. Va. Code &sect; 49-5-2 to commit delinquent 18-year-old youths to adult jails for less than six months. Because the detainees remained under continuing juvenile court jurisdiction, they had to be afforded the same commitment and rehabilitation rights as delinquent juveniles under 18. Under W. Va. Code 49-5-16(a), though juveniles over 14 could be housed in a juvenile detention portion of a county jail, they could not be held within sight or sound of adult prisoners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant charged the Commission with tortiously interfering with a contract. In the course of the proceedings, he altered his position and asserted that the Commission, by its action, unconstitutionally impaired the obligation of contract existing between him and a public service district. On appeal, appellant contended that the trial court improperly precluded him from developing his case by entering summary judgment. The court held that the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution did not create an absolute prohibition against State action impairing contracts. It prohibited unreasonable impairment only. The court on appeal determined that even if the Commission's actions did constitute an enactment of a law within the constitutional provision, the act of reducing the area of the public service district by the Commission was impelled by a pressing public concern for the welfare of the people within the area of the original public service district. By the time the Commission acted, it was clear that because of the financial impracticality of constructing the water system proposed, the public service district could not provide the water service initially anticipated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After several inmates filed habeas corpus petitions claiming that the conditions of confinement violated state statutes and were unconstitutional as cruel and unusual punishment, a monitor was appointed to oversee appellee department's compliance with the remedial order. When issues were raised in the circuit court as to the proper source of funds to pay the monitor's fees and expenses, appellant was permitted to intervene to represent the court's interests. The circuit court thereafter ordered appellant to pay the fees and costs. Appellant sought review, and the court reversed and remanded. While acknowledging that a monitor's fees and expenses were part of the costs of the habeas corpus proceeding filed by the inmates and that trial courts had broad discretion to impose payment of costs in such equitable proceedings per &sect; 59-2-11, the court held that there was no basis, statutory or otherwise, for the order in suit. In so ruling, the court noted that appellant was not even a party to the habeas corpus proceeding nor the entity whose conduct necessitated the appointment of the monitor.

The court granted the writ of mandamus, holding that state governmental immunity was superseded by federal constitutional protection against employment discrimination. The court held that affirmative relief was recoverable against the state as an employer in discrimination cases adjudicated by the commission or in the state courts because the paramount federal law was intended by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and federal law to be vindicated at the local level. The court further held that an award for back pay was not inappropriate because a person who unlawfully discriminated against another by refusing to hire could not deny an employment relationship, and that the award of reasonable attorney's fees was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the action for further fact findings, holding that counsel's failure to investigate a material element of defendant's defense could constitute ineffective assistance unless counsel's actions were excused by defendant's own actions, such as fabricating an alibi defense. Moreover, inexperience alone would not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel because defendant was required to prove acts or omissions which caused actual prejudice to the defense. Because the action was remanded, the court considered defendant's claim that his sentence was excessive, and it found that it was not so disproportionate to the crime to violate W. Va. Const. art.

Code &sect; 12-2-2 (1985) did not remove the funds from the state treasury or destroy the public accountability of those who spent them. The court also found that admission fees collected by state educational institutions at athletic events were &quot;public moneys.&quot; Athletic programs were a proper and integral part of the education provided by state universities, as were entertainment events such as concerts, lectures, exhibits, dramatic performances, and similar functions, the profits from which accrued to the benefit of a public university. The word &quot;private&quot; meant belonging to or concerning an individual person, company, or interest, and the court found that there was no individual person, company, or interest that stood to profit from university-sponsored events.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, as administrator of passenger's estate, sought review of the trial court's decision applying the doctrine of lex loci delecti and granting summary judgment in favor of appellee, as administrator of driver's estate, by determining that Ind. Code &sect; 9-3-3-1 (1980) precluded appellant from bringing a wrongful death action against appellee. The court held that West Virginia adhered to its traditional conflicts doctrine of lex loci delecti but reversed the judgment of the court below. The doctrine provided consistency, predictability, and ease of doctrine and was not to be lightly discarded. However, the court held that comity did not require the application of the substantive law of a foreign state when that law contravened the public policy of West Virginia. West Virginia never had an automobile guest passenger statute such as Ind. Code &sect; 9-3-3-1, and it was the state's strong public policy that persons injured by the negligence of another should be able to recover in tort. Therefore, the court declared that automobile guest passenger statutes violated the policy of the state and that it would no longer enforce those statutes of foreign jurisdictions in West Virginia courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order granting summary judgment in favor of appellee as administrator of driver's estate. Automobile guest passenger statutes, such as Indiana's, violated the public policy of West Virginia, and the court would no longer enforce those statutes of foreign jurisdictions such as Indiana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, commissioner of department of corrections and wardens of a correctional center, sought a writ to prohibit respondent circuit judge from ruling on the validity of W. Va. Exec. Order No. 11-86, which directed petitioners to accept no more inmates until it was determined that the conditions at the penal institutions were changed, and W. Va. Exec. Order No. 14-86, which directed petitioners to accept inmates on a priority basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The correctional center was judicially ruled unconstitutionally overcrowded and petitioners were ordered to reduce the inmate population. The governor issued W. Va. Exec. Order No. 11-86. The circuit judge held that Order No. 11-86 was invalid and ordered that the petitioners accept inmates that the circuit judge had sentenced, or held that they would be found in contempt. The court stayed that ruling and the governor issued W. Va. Exec. Order No. 14-86. The petitioners accepted certain inmates, but refused to accept an inmate whose penitentiary sentence was within the circuit judge's discretion. The court held that W. Va. Exec. Order Nos. 11-86, 14-86 (orders) were invalid because they improperly vested the discretion of where a convict was imprisoned in the executive, when the ambit of imprisonment lay within the discretion of the legislature in determining the sentences for crimes, and in the judiciary, when granted to it by statute. The orders also required petitioners to forbear their non-discretionary duties under W. Va. Code &sect; 28-5A-7. The orders were not valid exercises of the governor's power under the West Virginia Emergency Services Act, W. Va. Code &sect; 15-5-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioners' request for a writ of prohibition, holding that the governor's executive orders regarding the admission and nonadmission of inmates to the state correctional facilities were in conflict with state law. The court directed that the trial court grant petitioners reasonable time to comply with its order before sanctioning them for contempt.</SPAN></P>

The condition granting public access to the complaint and the board's decision only if the subject physician or podiatrist consented was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the circuit court's decision invalidating a statutory provision authorizing the board to issue private remands as these were eliminated by the amendment. The circuit court erred in holding that W. Va. Code &sect; 30-3C-3 of the statutes was unconstitutional.

Over the next 18 years, defendant was found incompetent twice and was alternately confined in state mental hospitals, the state penitentiary after conviction (which was later reversed based on ineffective counsel), and the county jail, but was also free during several escapes. Defendant asserted that there had been more than three unexcused terms of the trial court from the reversal of his conviction to his new trial and the trial court certified two questions to the court: 1) Did the trial court lack jurisdiction to try defendant pursuant to W.

The court answered the questions in the negative and remanded the cause, holding that the bulk of the delay prior to defendant's trial was due to his numerous and very lengthy escapes from the state mental hospitals and that his speedy trial rights were not violated under the &quot;three-term rule&quot; because three of the terms were not countable against the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In this original proceeding in mandamus against respondent administrative director of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, relator magistrates from four counties claimed that the statute setting their salaries, W. Va. Code &sect; 50-1-3, violated equal protection principles.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The magistrates in the four counties had their salaries set by statute based on the population of their counties. Magistrates in five counties with similar populations were paid more under the statute. The administrative director argued that the exception was logical because factors such as the presence of an interstate, dispersed population, high unemployment, high crime rate, topography, and adjoining populous counties justified the exception. The court held that it was not informed as to how these general factors favored the five counties as against the other four counties. There was no statistical data presented that would show that the higher paid magistrates did in fact have a heavier workload. The statute,&nbsp;W. Va. Code &sect; 50-1-3, contained an apparent irrational classification and the administrative director did not show any specific facts that would rationally justify this disparate treatment. The statute, to the extent it provided an exception permitting increased salaries for magistrates in five counties as against magistrates who are in counties with the same general population per magistrate, violated equal protection concepts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ as moulded. The court determined that in view of the unconstitutionality of the magistrate pay provision, the legislature should take corrective measures to revise this statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">W. Va. Code &sect; 11-13-2d (1978) taxed electricity generated and distributed in the state based on demand and final sale to the consumer. W. Va.

Electric power companies who generated power in West Virginia sought a declaratory judgment that the tax under &sect; 11-13-2m discriminated against interstate commerce. The trial court denied relief. The court affirmed. The court held that the statutes were part of a comprehensive, non-discriminatory, fairly apportioned business and occupation tax. The business of providing electricity was taxed, but only to the extent that generation and distribution occurred in the state. Transmission and distribution were not taxed for the out-of-state producers because those activities did not occur in the state. The court also held that the tax met the &quot;mirror image&quot; test in that, if applied by every jurisdiction, there would have been no impermissible interference with free trade. The court also held that because both statutes taxed the manufacture of electric power, the two sections did not tax &quot;substantially equivalent events.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The purchaser sought a writ of mandamus, compelling the clerk to retroactively file certain reports, which would have allowed him to comply with the requirements of W.

On appeal, the court held that the purchaser, who failed to file certain reports within the statutory filing period, but who claimed that he could have complied with &sect; 11A-3-20 but for the clerk's office being improperly closed, was not entitled to the writ of mandamus because the elements for the issuance of such a writ were not established. The court determined that the purchaser did not have a clear existing right to file the reports beyond the statutory filing period, nor did the clerk have a clear legal duty to make such a filing. The court concluded that the issuance of the writ would have compelled the clerk to act in contravention of &sect; 11A-3-20 and the public policy favoring the security of land titles.

The court held that the circuit court could not enjoin the city council from exercising its legislative powers of enacting a municipal ordinance and concluded that the ordinance in the case, involving administration of a floodwall system, concerned the public safety and health, and was, therefore, presumptively passed in good faith.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The business was audited and assessed a deficiency which was appealed to the circuit court. Subsequent to the assessment, the United States Supreme Court held that the tax in question unconstitutionally discriminated against interstate commerce. Based on that holding, the circuit court granted the business summary judgment. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded judgment, holding that while judicial decisions generally operated retrospectively, this case met the criteria for prospective application. The court found that the issue was a traditionally settled area of law, the wholesale tax was a substantive rather then a procedural rule, it was not a common law decision that was overruled but rather a statute, the decision was a constitutional interpretation, and the previous law required the payment of the tax. The court held that in light of the above, the new rule was to be applied prospectively only and the business was not to have benefited from the new rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner citizen sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent state election officials to promulgate rules and regulations to govern campaign expenditures under the West Virginia Election Code, W. Va. Code &sect; 3-1-1 et seq., (1979).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In opposition to the petition, the officials asserted that mandamus was inappropriate because alternative relief was available from the legislature. The court held that W. Va. Code &sect; 3-1A-6 required the officials to make regulations to carry out the legislature's goal of preserving the integrity of state elections, as required by W. Va. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11. Although certain language of W. Va. Code &sect; 3-1A-6 was permissive, the legislative history of the Code required regulations to curtail abuses crafted to bypass the prohibitions of W. Va. Code &sect; 3-8-9(a). Section 3-8-9(a)(3), which provided for compensation for the distribution of pamphlets and materials, and &sect; 3-8-9(a)(8), which provided for the conveyance of voters to the polls, were subject to abuse if there was no review of the amounts paid. The West Virginia Minimum Wage and Hours Law, W. Va. Code &sect; 21-5C-2, set a minimum standard of reasonable compensation, and the West Virginia Election Code set a maximum standard of reasonable compensation for the services rendered to candidates and parties in preparation for an election. Further guidance was necessary from the officials on what constituted &quot;reasonable&quot; expenditures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a writ of mandamus that compelled the officials to promulgate rules governing the reasonable rates of compensation for services rendered to political candidates and parties, governing the itemization of expenses and services rendered to candidates and parties, and to develop detailed financial forms that disclosed the character of expenses and services rendered to candidates and parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature passed H.B. 2094, 68th Leg. (W. Va. 1986) in response to the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 651-667, which required states to implement child support techniques in order to continue to receive federal funding under the Aid to Families of Dependent Children program. The circuit court judge brought the petition to prevent implementation of the family law master provisions of H.B. 2094. The court held that H.B. 2094 improperly removed the jurisdiction for divorces and other domestic matters from the circuit court to the family law master. Under W. Va. Const. art. 8, &sect; 5, jurisdiction over divorce cases was placed in the state circuit court and the state legislature's power to change the jurisdiction of divorce cases was eliminated. Because the constitution placed the jurisdiction for divorces and other domestic matters in the circuit court, the legislature's efforts to divest this jurisdiction by statute was unconstitutional and void. The court stuck out article 4 of H.B. 2094, which set up the family master system. The petition for the writ of prohibition and mandamus was granted.</SPAN></P>

In 1981, the court, in Adkins v. McEldowney, 167 W.Va. 469, 280 S.E.2d 231 (1981), held unconstitutional W. Va. Code &sect; 43-1-5 because it restricted illegitimate children's rights. In 1983, one of the legitimate children filed an action to partition her father's real property, and the illegitimate children filed a motion to intervene. The trial court denied the motion, and the illegitimate children appealed. On appeal the court reversed and remanded the case. It held that (1) the record clearly indicated that no innocent purchasers for value would be prejudiced by retroactive application of Adkins, (2) the record was not clear as to whether the legitimate children relied on the former law and precedent to their detriment, and (3) where there was no justifiable and detrimental reliance upon W.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an administrator of his deceased son's estate, filed a wrongful death action against defendants, a hospital and its physician, following the death of plaintiff's minor son. Plaintiff's complaint alleged simple negligence and sought compensatory damages after his son died of complications from a biopsy in which the child's colon was accidentally perforated. Evidence revealed that plaintiff and the child's mother consented to a sigmoidoscopy, but not a biopsy. A jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff for compensatory damages. The court reversed and remanded, holding that it was compelled to reduce the jury's award or, at the option of plaintiff, to award a new trial because plaintiff's counsel implied in his closing argument that the duty of the jury was to place a value on the deceased's life. The court held that because defendants made no objections to the comment, the error was waived, and therefore, the court could not reverse the entire trial.

The identification occurred after defendant, and possibly one other individual, participated in a physical lineup and a photographic array.

The photograph used by police for the identification by this witness was a picture of defendant in a uniform with the phrase &quot;U.S. Army&quot; written across one side of the military issue shirt. Further, the eyewitness was shown the photograph of defendant immediately after she had seen defendant in the physical lineup. Defendant challenged the identification process, among other things, on appeal. The court reversed, holding that taken together, the circumstances surrounding the identification process violated the edict that such identification processes are supposed to be free from impermissible suggestiveness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court, Kanawha County (West Virginia) certified two questions after it overruled defendant state officials' objection to its ruling regarding the Governor's veto even though the Governor was not a party. The questions were whether the Governor was an indispensable party and whether his line-item veto was contrary to law. The circuit court ruled that the Governor was not an indispensable party and that his veto was contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, parents of children enrolled in the public school system, challenged the Governor's line-item veto of an appropriation for public school salary equity adjustments. The court found that the Governor was an indispensable party because his line-item veto was the subject of the action and the matter could not be fairly adjudicated without his presence. The action was not a continuation or enforcement of issues regarding the constitutionality of the public school system, which was the subject matter of plaintiffs' original action against the state officials. The Governor was not an indispensable party to the original action because his office was not directly involved in the administration of the public schools. In the underlying action regarding his line-item veto, only the Governor had the constitutional authority to veto or reduce items in the budget bill. Therefore, the court concluded that he was an indispensable party in an action challenging his exercise of his constitutional authority. The court declined to address the substantive issue of whether his veto was contrary to law because the Governor's response raised certain factual issues to counter plaintiffs' claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the circuit court's certified question of whether the Governor was an indispensable party in the affirmative and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner judge's widow brought an action seeking a writ of mandamus to compel respondent Auditor of the State of West Virginia (auditor) to authorize and direct the payment of her spousal annuity under West Virginia Code &sect; 51-9-6b (1981 Replacement Vol.), which relates to the West Virginia Retirement System for Judges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the auditor's contention that the execution of his duties with respect to the payment of a spousal annuity under the judges' retirement system was contingent upon exercise of the chief executive's &quot;discretionary&quot; role to certify entitlement to the receipt of judges' retirement system benefits. The court noted that imparting chief executive discretion in the acceptance of judicial resignations would raise serious separation of powers problems. The court noted that the governor's duties in this regard were merely ministerial pursuant to W. Va. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 8. The court held that since gubernatorial performance of ministerial duties may be enforced by way of mandamus after the passage of an unreasonable period of time, where, following submission of a request for benefits and proof of eligibility, the governor fails to certify eligibility for the receipt of judges' retirement system benefits within one month, the auditor had a mandatory ministerial duty to order the issuance of warrants necessary for the payment of those benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a writ of mandamus against the auditor to prepare his letter of certification of eligibility for benefits in the judges' retirement system, and, among other things, to present forthwith a proposed gubernatorial order and a certified copy of the judge's certification of eligibility for benefits in the judges' retirement system. The court awarded the widow attorney fees and costs expended in the prosecution of her claim.</SPAN></P>

As a result, the prisoner was charged with and found guilty of first-degree sexual assault. The prisoner filed the instant proceeding, claiming that he was denied due process because the defense team was overmatched by the prosecution. One of the defense attorneys had not had a criminal trial before the prisoner's case and the other had been a circuit judge for 16 years. The court denied the prisoner's petition, holding first that he was not denied due process by an overmatch between the defense and prosecuting attorneys because he had not shown ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that the private attorney was properly employed under W.Va. Code 7-7-8 [1972] and that the use of the prisoner's prior inconsistent statement to impeach his credibility was proper. Finally, the court held that the interrogatory asking the jury if the prisoner committed a felony with the use, presentation, or brandishment of a firearm was proper because he was the principal and W. Va. Code, 62-12-2(b) [1981] did not require proof that the principal held the gun at all times while committing a felony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The member applied to the board for disability benefits. Under the procedures prescribed by W. Va.

Based on the doctors' report, the board denied benefits. The member sought a hearing for an opportunity to cross-examine the doctors. The board did not grant the hearing. Thus, the member brought his suit to compel the board to grant him a hearing. The circuit court denied the request, finding that the member had not shown a clear legal right to a mandamus. In reversing, the court found that the member, who was a member of the fund created under W. Va. Code, 8-22-16 through 28, had a property interest in the fund such that he was entitled to some due process protection. The case was remanded to permit the member to have the benefit of additional procedural safeguards, such as the right to take the depositions of the doctors appointed by the board and to appear before the board.</SPAN></P>

The fact that he pled guilty to those charges did not diminish his right to counsel. Further, it did not appear from the record that defendant waived his right to counsel.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a civil rights activist and former university student. He was suspended for poor performance and denied admission the following semester. He made telephone calls to the university to try to reenroll. The conversations became unpleasant and defendant berated the various persons with whom he spoke. Defendant argued that W. Va. Code &sect; 61-8-16(a)(4) (1984) was overbroad and prohibited conduct beyond the legitimate governmental interest in preventing harassment. The court found that the statute did not unduly infringe the first amendment and was not overbroad because it did not prohibit communicative speech. The statute prohibited only telephone calls made with the intent to harass. Harassment was not protected merely because it was accomplished using a telephone. Although the university was a State agency, the court found that allowing defendant to make repeated harassing calls would impede legitimate government business and there was a point where one could not repeatedly call a public servant and threaten to fry him in oil.</SPAN></P>

A deputy administered field sobriety tests to defendant. No chemical test was given. On appeal, the court found no error in the trial court. The court held that the indictment was not fatally defective because it met the requirements of W.Va. Code &sect; 17C-5-2(b) (1981). Except for a small omission, the language of the indictment was substantially similar to the statutory language for the offense charged. Further, the reference to West Virginia Code &sect; 17C-5-2(b) (1981) fully informed defendant of the particular offense with which he was charged and enabled the trial court to determine the statute on which he was charged. The court rejected defendant's argument that the victim's failure to wear his seatbelt was an independent, intervening cause of his death. An intervening cause was a new and independent force that broke the causal connection between the original act and the injury, and itself becomes the direct and immediate cause of the injury. The fact that the victim did not take precautionary steps that could have prevented his eventual demise was not an intervening cause.</SPAN></P>

(Supp. 1984) against defendant purported father, on the basis that her action was not filed within ten years of the birth of her daughter, as required under West Virginia Code &sect; 48-7-4(a) (Supp. 1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On several prior occasions, the mother sought to obtain support from the purported father. When the Intrastate Support Act, West Virginia Code &sect; 48-7-1 et seq. (Supp. 1984) was passed, she filed a paternity suit against him under the Act. That same year, the state passed West Virginia Code &sect; 48-7-4(a) (Supp. 1984), which limited the amount of time for a paternity to action to be filed to ten years after the birth of the child. The trial court dismissed the mother's action as being time-barred under &sect; 48-7-4(a). The mother appealed. The court reversed the judgment and remanded for additional proceedings. The court held that the ten-year limitation under &sect; 48-7-4(a) should not have been applied to the mother. The court reasoned that because the mother had sought to obtain child support from the purported father on three prior occasions before the enactment of &sect; 48-7-4, the ten-year limitation period for filing a civil suit against the purported father could not have been sustained under the Due Process Clause, Article III, &sect; 10 of the West Virginia Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was arrested on charges of driving while under the influence of alcohol. The arresting officer submitted an affidavit of the particulars to the department, and the department issued an order suspending the driver's license for a period of 10 years pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 17C-5A-2(c)(4) [1981]. A copy of the suspension order was sent to the driver, along with notice of his right to request an administrative hearing within 10 days of receipt thereof. The driver's attorney failed to timely request a hearing due to a mistaken belief of when the notice was received. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the driver's petition and denied the writ. On appeal, the court held that the fact that the suspension order was signed by someone other than the Commissioner did not make it void on its face, as under W. Va. Code &sect; 17A-2-11 (1974 Replacement Vol.), the Commissioner could lawfully delegate the power to make temporary license suspension orders to duly appointed representatives. The court found that the untimely request for a hearing was a waiver of his right thereto.

Va. Code &sect;&sect;33-11-4(3) and (5), by plaintiff insured against defendants, an insurer and its employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Numerous thefts and arsons of cars in the area occurred. The insured's car was stolen. The insurer paid the claim. After the insured's relative's car was stolen, and the insurer delayed paying the claim, it came to light that the insurer accused both of mafia involvement in a memorandum. The insured alleged intentional infliction of severe emotional distress, libel and slander, insulting words, improper insurance claims handling, and breach of a fiduciary relationship. The jury awarded the insured compensatory and punitive damages. The court held that the employees' testimony was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that they placed information in the insured's file that they knew to be false. Because an employee testified that his statement about the insured's connection with the mafia was prompted by the &quot;bad area&quot; involved in the theft of her car and then that the &quot;bad area&quot; related not to the area of the theft, but rather to the area where she lived, and then that he did not know where she lived, the court concluded that the memorandum was written with such willful, wanton, and reckless disregard of its truth or falsity that no recognized privilege applied to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified questions, upholding the verdict, finding that the insured had a private cause of action against the insurer for violation of the unfair trade practices statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The magistrates contended that they were entitled to equal pay for equal work and that they had presented a factual record showing that the work of all magistrates was equal. In denying the writ of mandamus, the court held that the evidence clearly showed wide disparities in the types of judicial function performed by small county magistrates vis-a-vis large county magistrates. However, the magistrates in the small counties contended that the time they spent on call was equivalent to time spent performing judicial functions. However, the court concluded in an earlier case that on-call time was not time spent in the performance of a magistrate's judicial function. The court could not say that the salary schedule found in W. Va. Code, 50-1-8 (1984) contained a legislative classification that rested on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State's objectives.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was given Miranda rights when arrested, but she claimed that her rights were violated when she made incriminating statements following her arrest. On review, the court disagreed. A warrant was executed in West Virginia for defendant to be arrested and held in Ohio. When defendant was arrested at her brother's trailer, a Miranda warning was given, but she nevertheless told officers what happened on the night of the victim's death. The court held that the post-arrest statements were admissible although a West Virginia arrest warrant was defective. The court ruled that defendant had no expectation of privacy under U.S. Const. amend. IV or W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 when her brother permitted officers to enter his trailer. Defendant was a visitor there, so the strictures of the U.S. Supreme Court requiring a valid warrant absent exigent circumstances to arrest a person in his own home were inapplicable. The court rejected defendant's claim that there was an error by the trial court in failing to hold a competency hearing under W. Va. Code 27-6A-1(d) (1983) because defendant's counsel did not request such a hearing and no insanity issue was raised.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners wished to solicit charitable donations during the evening hours. Petitioners argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The city officials argued that it was unlikely that the ordinance would have been enforced, and thus, a writ of mandamus was improper. The court granted the writ of mandamus. In doing so, the court held that restrictions on door-to-door canvassing and solicitation that did not permit some evening activity during the week impermissibly impinged upon the free speech rights of groups and individuals who desired to use those modes of expression. Further, the failure to define the term &quot;sunset&quot; in an ordinance restricting door-to-door canvassing and solicitation to &quot;between 9:00 a.m. and sunset&quot; rendered such ordinance unconstitutionally vague.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge dismissed the municipal ordinance offenses against defendant after defendant asserted a demand for a jury trial. The trial judge suggested to the prosecutor that the charges could be re-levied under state law. State law provided for longer incarceration terms than the penalties available under the municipal ordinances. Defendant asserted that his right to a jury trial was being violated. The trial judge asserted that municipal clerks were not authorized to draw juries and that his practice was to request a waiver of a jury trial right if he indicated that he did not intend to impose incarceration for the offense. The court granted the writ in prohibition, finding that the procedure used by the trial judge created a degree of coercion so great that defendant had little choice but to waive his jury trial right to avoid a potentially longer jail term. The court determined that the trial judge's practice placed an excessive and unnecessary price on the exercise of the basic constitutional right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the taxpayers sought to have the value the county assessor placed on the corporate taxpayer's timberland increased to reflect its purchase price, the board of review upheld the county assessor's valuation. The circuit court affirmed this ruling. Both the board of review and the circuit court concluded that deed values could not be used as evidence of true and actual value because there had been an appraisal of the property in 1965 by the State Tax Commissioner. On appeal, the court reversed the circuit court's judgment because it was based on a erroneous conception of the law, namely that property could not be appraised at a value greater than that set by the State Tax Commissioner under an old appraisal. The court held that the trial court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the only proper measure of value was the old property tax appraisal. The trial court improperly rejected evidence of the price paid for the property in an arm's length transaction, which was relevant to the true and actual value. A violation of W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 1b, could not be established without a showing that other property was intentionally and systematically undervalued.</SPAN></P>

II, &sect;10 because the act was a rational means of achieving the legitimate legislative goal of promoting healthy competition by penalizing retailers and wholesalers that sell goods below cost in an attempt to destroy competition. The court also found that the challenged portions of the statute were not unconstitutionally vague under the less restrictive vagueness standard. Additionally, the court concluded that appellant's special legislation argument lacked merit. Finally, the court found that the statute did not violate the antitrust provisions of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;1 since both prohibit sales below cost for the purpose of injuring or destroying competition.</SPAN></P>

The agencies claimed that the lower court did not abuse its discretion in failing to impose a timetable. The court held that (1) the agencies had a duty to ensure the delivery and maintenance of a thorough and efficient system of free schools as that system was embodied in the master plan; (2) the master plan was to be enforced until modified by the court; (3) certain policies developed by the agencies did not comply with the duty under W.

The court granted the writ. It noted that although there were strong reasons supporting the confidentiality of attorney disciplinary proceedings, the public interest involved outweighed those considerations. Attorneys were officers having a public trust, and accordingly the public was entitled to know of disciplinary actions brought against them. Moreover, the state constitution granted the public access to judicial and quasijudicial proceedings, and attorney disciplinary matters qualified as quasijudicial proceedings. The state attorney disciplinary rules providing for confidentiality were thus unconstitutional. According, the writ of mandamus that petitioner sought was issued.</SPAN></P>

The court found that neither an important governmental objective nor a compelling state interest was furthered by the gender classification. The statute was not invalidated, however, because the law's provisions could be extended to females.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the State Tax Department, appealed from the Circuit Court of Kanawha (West Virginia), which struck down the business and occupation tax on the generation of electric power, W.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">W. Va. Code &sect; 11-13-2m was enacted in 1978 as a part of a plan to reorganize the business and occupation tax on utilities. Electric utilities generating or selling electricity in the state had been taxed under &sect; 11-13-2d based on sales and demand charges for domestic purposes and at another rate for all other purposes. Utilities generating electricity in the state, but transmitting it out of state, were taxed under the general manufacturing tax rate. The court found that the 1978 amendments harmonized the tax rate between the generation and sale in the state and the generation of electric power in the state for transmission out of state, and that &sect; 11-13-2 was also amended to bring equality to the measurement of the value between &sect;&sect; 11-13-2d and 11-13-2m taxes. Considering the amendments in their entirety, it was apparent that the Legislature did not single out and tax only the manufacturing of electricity that was transmitted out of state where the manufacturing of electricity that was used in the state was taxed at the same rate. The court found no discrimination between &sect;&sect; 11-13-2d and 11-13-2m and held that &sect; 11-13-2m did not violate the provisions of 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 391.</SPAN></P>

The court resolved several issues raised by intervenor Administrative Director of the Courts concerning the judicial retirement system and the public employees retirement system that impacted upon the judge's potential disability retirement. The court held, among other things, that military service, or its equivalent, rendered during a period of compulsory military service was to be considered as served under W.Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case consolidating four suits, petitioners sought a writ of prohibition against magistrates who had entered orders allowing suggestions. Two petitioners sought a writ to prevent further suggestion of their wages and two others sought to prohibit suggestion of their bank accounts. All petitioners contended that the suggestion statutes were unconstitutional because they did not require notice to a judgment debtor of his statutory rights to exemptions and did not provide adequate prior notice of the taking of property. The court denied a writ to petitioners who sought to prevent further suggestion of their wages and the court awarded a writ to petitioners who sought to prohibit suggestion of their bank accounts. The court held that notice to a debtor that his wages were being suggested had to include a statement that exemptions existed under state and federal law. The court found that the money removed from petitioners' bank accounts was entirely exempt from execution since the money in the accounts came entirely from social security benefits. As to the other petitioners, their briefs indicated that they now had notice of exemption rights and thus, could assert them at any time.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the writs of mandamus and held that: (1) the voters were not required to first seek relief in circuit court; (2) it was plain and unambiguous that West Virginia state senators representing senatorial districts composed of more than one county were required to be residents of both the county and the district from which they were elected; (3) one candidate was not a resident of the appropriate district, and the other was not a resident of the appropriate county; and (4) the one-year durational residency requirement for state senators found in W.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord brought an eviction action against the tenants, pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 55-3A-1 et seq. (1983), alleging that the tenants had not complied with the lease by failing to allow an inspection of their apartment, interfering with the housing project's management, and creating a disturbance in the parking lot of the apartments. The tenants filed a petition to prohibit the trial from being conducted, claiming a defense of retaliation, and the court granted the writ of prohibition. The court held that the tenants were entitled to a jury trial because genuine issues of fact existed relating to the landlord's allegations and the tenants' defense, and the right to recover possession of real property was protected by the Seventh Amendment. The court held that the tenants had the right to file a counterclaim under W. Va. R. C. P. 13, and to obtain discovery against the landlord under Rule 26. The court also held that the time periods prescribed by the summary eviction statute were not unreasonably short and did not deprive the tenants of the fundamental standards of due process required for a fair trial, because &sect; 55-3A-3(d) specifically provided for a continuance if necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county leased the property to the foundation to operate the warehouse. After the assessor made the assessment upon the property, the foundation claimed that the property was exempt from taxation. When the circuit court declared that the assessment was improper, the assessor sought review. The court reversed and remanded. The leasehold interest under which the foundation operated the warehouse, and similar uses of leasehold interests, did not qualify for an exemption. While the court recognized that the operation of the warehouse may have lessened the problem of local unemployment, the foundation used its leasehold interest primarily to maintain a commercial enterprise. The foundation may justifiably have been required to share in the tax burden, and the assessment was not improper. The court held that a county assessment for ad valorem tax purposes of a leasehold interest in county property was not prohibited by the Act. Inasmuch as the action concerned only the leasehold interest, the assessment was contrary neither to the state's constitution nor to the provisions of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The two juveniles alleged that, as victims of mistreatment at the facility, they had been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5. The first juvenile alleged that while he was asleep one evening in a security room, a correctional officer entered the room, kicked him and struck him in the chest and eye. The second juvenile alleged that he was unlawfully locked down in his room at the facility. Superintendents filed their motions to dismiss both cases as being moot. The court held that it was not deprived of jurisdiction to pass upon the constitutionality of conditions of incarceration at the facility in view of the allegations of continuous and systematic deprivation of fundamental rights at the facility. The court determined that the accusations of the juveniles were sufficient to merit a factual development of whether the management of the juvenile correctional facility by the superintendents and other responsible state agencies had resulted in legally impermissible conditions. Because the record was insufficiently developed, the court transferred the cases to a circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners contended that the state education board did not have the authority to adopt and enforce a rule that required students to achieve a 2.0 grade point average to participate in nonacademic extracurricular activities. The student alleged that the county education board's rule that also required that students receive a passing grade in every class violated his constitutional rights. The court denied petitioners' request for a writ of mandamus and affirmed the circuit court's denial of injunctive relief. The court held that the state board's rule was a legitimate exercise of its power of &quot;general supervision&quot; over the state's educational system under W. Va. Const. art. XII, &sect; 2 and that the county board's rule was a legitimate exercise of its power of &quot;control, supervision, and regulation&quot; of extracurricular activities under W. Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondent, the Chairperson of the Board of Ballot Commissioners of Kanawha County, to place his name on the primary election ballot as a candidate for the office of magistrate, and to compel respondent Secretary of State for West Virginia, to promulgate regulations defining the term &quot;impecunious candidate&quot; for purposes waiving the filing fee under W. Va. Code, 3-5-8.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court had previously held that, to the extent W. Va. Code, 3-5-8 failed to provide a reasonable alternative to filing fees for impecunious candidates, it was unconstitutional. In response, the Secretary had sent out notices advising that a qualified candidate could file an affidavit of hardship. Such affidavit triggered the duty to place a qualified candidate's name on the ballot. Once the candidate fully complied fully with the requirements established by the Secretary in his election advisory, he could not refuse to place the candidate's name on the ballot. The court then addressed the contention that the Secretary's failure to promulgate regulations defining the term &quot;impecunious,&quot; as it applied to candidates seeking waiver of filing fees. The advisory required a &quot;financial hardship statement&quot;, but left it to the potential candidate, for self-determination, the issue of whether the criterion was met, subject to a criminal prosecution for false swearing if the candidate guessed wrong. The court held that the lack of any criteria for determining when potential candidates qualified for the waiver of filing fees rendered the election advisory unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding in mandamus, petitioner voters sought to compel respondents, a state senator candidate, the West Virginia Secretary of State, and county ballot commissioners, to withdraw the candidate's certification and to omit or strike his name from an official ballot. The issue was a candidate's residency requirement under West Virginia Constitution art. VI, &sect; 12.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters alleged that 1) the candidate was not a bona fide resident of the district or county, and therefore, ineligible to be elected or to hold the office of state senator; and 2) the candidate would not have been a bona fide resident for the requisite one year under West Virginia Constitution art. VI, &sect; 12 before the election. The court found that the candidate did not meet the constitutional durational residency requirement. Specifically, the candidate had no &quot;residence,&quot; a settled or fixed abode, or &quot;place of abode,&quot; in the district or County. The court found that the candidate did not sleep at his local office and maintained no apartment there. Rather, the rooms in the building were used as either office space or for storage. Finally, the court held that the durational residency requirement under West Virginia Constitution art. VI, &sect; 12, met constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

At an administrative hearing, only the driver and her sister testified. She objected to the admission into evidence of reports by the police officer and the other driver on the basis of hearsay. The rules of evidence from civil cases were applied in the administrative hearing under W. Va. Code &sect; 29A-5-2 (1964). On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that accident reports were only admissible under the official record exception to the hearsay rule in the civil context if they met criteria calculated to insure their reliability. Here, the hearsay report from the officer and the other driver were the sole basis for the commissioner's determination that a reasonable possibility of judgment existed.

The court concluded that: (1) defendant's sentence was substantially longer than the maximum permissible sentence for aggravated robbery in a majority of jurisdictions; (2) none of defendant's prior offenses involved any violence to a person and that the offense was his first adult conviction; (3) the inquiry on remand was not whether defendant should be incarcerated, but whether 75 years was disproportionate; and (4) defendant's sentence was disparate and violated W.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the indictment charged him with two offenses for what was essentially one robbery in violation of both federal and state double jeopardy principles. The court reversed the judgment. In order for defendant to be convicted of two robberies it had to be shown that he placed two individuals in fear and apprehension with the intention of taking money or another thing of value from their person or under their physical control. The court held that the requirement was adequately met. Defendant intended to take property that was in the custody of both of his victims. The court held that two separate robberies were committed. The court found no error in the admission of evidence regarding the flight of defendant and his accomplice from the scene of the crime. Defendant's proffered instruction on eyewitness identification was properly rejected because it placed the trial judge in the position of an advocate of defendant's case. The court based its reversal on an improper jury instruction that placed the burden upon defendant to prove his alibi sufficiently to create a reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury.</SPAN></P>

Va. Code &sect; 24-2B-1. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that rates set by the legislature and by the commission were presumed to be valid. It was the burden of the gas company, who was challenging their presumptive validity, to clearly show that the rates established were confiscatory. The gas company failed to meet that burden. The legislature made provisions for cases in which the moratorium could cause confiscation of private property without just compensation. A gas utility could petition for an emergency rate increase during the moratorium if it could show it was experiencing extreme financial hardship as a result of the moratorium. The presence of the emergency rate procedure for cases of extreme financial hardship answered claims that &sect; 24-2B-1 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the requested information did not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant purchasing customers appealed from the seizure order entered by the Circuit Court of Wyoming County (West Virginia) at a prejudgment hearing for immediate repossession held in the detinue action filed against them by plaintiff furniture retailer. The customer argued that the retailer held an invalid security interest and that the trial court erroneously precluded them from asserting valid defenses at the pre-seizure hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customers stopped making payments on the balance they owed for furniture purchased under two retail installment agreements. The customers' counterclaim asserted that the inadequate description of the furniture in the financing agreement rendered the retailer's security interest invalid. The customers also alleged that the retailer included credit life and property coverage in its sales agreement without affording them the right to buy insurance elsewhere in violation of W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 46A-3-109(2)(d) and (e) (1981). The court held that under W. Va. Code &sect; 55-6-1, defenses that would defeat the underlying debt or the right to assert a security interest were admissible at a pre-seizure hearing. Because the court had no reviewable record on the adequacy of the collateral descriptions, particularly descriptions for undefined lists of numbers, it remanded the case for a hearing on this defense. The court also reasoned that the retailer's alleged violation of W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 46A-3-109(2)(d) and (e) was no defense to the seizure or to the underlying debt. The court accordingly determined that this assertion did not defeat the retailer's right to repossess the secured property.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court disposed of the preliminary motions and referred the case to the commissioner to take evidence and make a report to the circuit court. The commissioner admitted his refusal to file his report until his fees were paid. The wife asserted two grounds for relief under W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 17. She claimed that the commissioner's refusal conditioned the rendition of justice upon the financial capacity of the litigants, and that the practice of paying commissioners before the circuit court acted on their report encouraged commissioners to decide cases in a way that enhanced the likelihood of prompt payment. The court agreed. The held that art. III, &sect; 17 was clear in its mandate that the judicial process was not to be affected by the litigants' financial condition. The court found that W. Va. Code 59-1-8 [1943], permitting a commissioner to withhold his report until fees were paid, was unconstitutional when applied to divorce cases.

The court held that the conservation officer was considered a law enforcement officer and had authority, under W. Va.

The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing to give a jury instruction requiring defendant be acquitted if the jury determined that the plant at issue did not contain Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The court noted that the trial court read to the jury, verbatim, the statutory definition of marijuana 60A-1-101(n) (1981), and such definition did not require the inclusion of THC.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Marion County (West Virginia) certified an action filed by plaintiff city against defendant property owner to collect delinquent fire service fees. The circuit court held that Fairmont, W.Va., City Ordinance No. 524 was unconstitutional under a prior decision of the court and that such finding of unconstitutionality was not applicable to delinquent taxes that accrued prior to the date of the court's prior decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner sought to defeat the collection of the fire service fees by claiming that the charge was an ad valorem tax and violated the provisions of W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The city argued that the fire service fee was a service fee and not a property tax. While the case was pending, the court in a separate action, decided that city ordinances that imposed upon owners of property a police service charge based upon the value of property were an ad valorem tax upon property. It further held in that case that such ordinances violated W.Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 1 when the property was taxed to the maximum amount permitted under &sect; 1, known as the tax limitation amendment and W. Va. Code &sect; 11-8-6d (1949). The city admitted that it was already at the maximum levy rate authorized by &sect; 11-8-6d. The circuit court held that such prior decision applied and that Fairmont, W.Va., City Ordinance No. 524 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that the fire service fee was a property tax and not a fee as argued by the city. The court further held that the city was not liable to the property owner for taxes paid pursuant to the unconstitutional ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The union sought to compel respondents to provide them an opportunity, during the next ensuing radio broadcasts of West Virginia University (WVU) football games, to express contrasting views to those expressed in paid radio advertisements sponsored by coal associations. The court granted the writ because it found that respondents had a constitutional obligation to present opposing viewpoints to those expressed in the coal associations' advertisement and that the union was the appropriate spokesman for the presentation of that viewpoint. Respondents conceded that the coal associations' advertisements were both political and controversial. Under the Communications Act of 1935, 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151 et seq. the court found that as instrumentality of the state, respondents were required to offer a balanced presentation of opposing points of view in governmentally created forums. The court determined that the radio network, run by respondents, was an instrumentality of the state since WVU was chartered by the legislature. The court also determined that respondents needed to promulgate standards under W. Va. Code &sect; 18-26 for evaluating the requests for response time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that the union had a right to respond to the coal associations' advertisements and ordered that respondents promulgate standards to be used in evaluating requests for response time. Accordingly, the court granted the writ of mandamus as molded by the court.</SPAN></P>

Va. Code 11-12A-2 [1971]. The company argued its interstate telephone business was not taxable under the Code because it did not &quot;begin and end&quot; in the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company owned and operated telephone facilities in the State and was a subsidiary of a corporation, which provided interstate telephone service through the country. The company provided intrastate service for about 60 percent of the calls made within the State. In its capacity as an affiliate of the corporation, it was a partner in an enterprise that allowed persons in the State to telephone persons across state lines. The partnership arrangement was such that the company's independent transmission of calls received by it from out-of-state affiliates to persons in the State did not in and of itself yield any profits; rather, the company received revenues as a member of the partnership and not as a direct result of its business beginning and ending within the State. On appeal, the court held that the company's interstate revenues were not subject to the tax on gross income under the Code because its transmission and receipt of long-distance telephone calls across state lines did not constitute business beginning and ending within the State. The evidence showed that the company's revenues from interstate calls were not generated by business beginning and ending within the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A child fell from a theater stage at a state university, and he and his parents brought an action for damages against the board, which owned the theater, and against various other defendants involved in the design and manufacture of the stage, including the elevator company. The trial court dismissed the complaint against the board on the grounds that, under the provisions of W. Va. Code &sect; 14-2-2, a proceeding against a state agency could only be brought in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County. The action remained on the docket as against the remaining parties. The company then instituted an action in Kanawha County seeking indemnity or contribution from the board. That court transferred the action to the trial court, and the trial court dismissed the complaint, again on venue grounds. The court reversed. The court first held that the order dismissing the company's complaint was a final order and could be immediately appealed. The court then held that venue was proper in the trial court, despite the provisions of &sect; 14-2-2. The board had liability insurance coverage, and therefore recovery was sought against the insurer and not the state. Thus, &sect; 14-2-2 did not apply.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions but remanded for resentencing. The court held that double jeopardy protected defendant from multiple punishments for the same crime. Because robbery was a lesser-included offense of felony murder, defendant could not have been sentenced for both crimes. The court held that the trial court had not abused its discretion in refusing the change of venue motion because defendant had failed to show that the news articles had prejudiced the jury against him and had failed to take the opportunity to poll the jury to determine for a fact if they had caused him prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested trying to use credit cards stolen in a robbery, for which defendant was convicted and sentenced to 45 years imprisonment. He challenged, inter alia, the length of the sentence imposed by the trial court as being excessive and disproportional, particularly in light of the pre-sentence report which recommended a minimum sentence with no probation, based on the facts of the crime, defendant's age, and lack of criminal record. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, but reversed the sentence. The court held that a trial judge's discretion, while very broad in sentencing for robbery, had to be tempered by W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5, which required sentences to be proportional to the character and degree of the offense. Even though the sentence imposed was within legislatively prescribed limits, the court ruled that the trial court ignored proportional principles and the sentence shocked the conscience of the court and society.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the cause was required to be remanded for a hearing on the State's failure to provide defendant with information concerning the eye witness's criminal record and its potential prejudice to defendant's case. The court was unable to determine from the record what transpired with regard to defendant's efforts to obtain the witness' criminal record and what effect on the trial the criminal record would have had. Otherwise, the court found the indictment adequately informed defendant of the nature of the charge and was sufficient to support a conviction for any of the several degrees of homicide. Also, there was sufficient evidence both of a death and of its cause by a criminal agency, the prosecutor's cross-examination was aggressive but lawful, and a photo identification was not shown to have been prompted by the police.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, contrary to the corporate taxpayer's contentions, the assessment was not contrary to the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution. The court found that despite the separate activities of the corporate taxpayer's divisions, the corporate taxpayer was deemed a unitary business with a substantial nexus in the state through qualifying to do business and engaging in coal mining operations and sales of metal products under one corporate umbrella.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1981 the West Virginia state legislature amended W. Va. Code, 30-2-1, to require all West Virginia University law school graduates after July 1, 1983, to take the Bar examination. Until that time, graduates of the law school that the students attended had been not required to successfully complete the examination in order to qualify for admission to practice. The Students contend that the legislature did not have authority to regulate admission to practice. The court granted the writ. The court held that amended W. Va. Code, 30-2-1 was repugnant to and conflicted with West Virginia Rule 1.020. The former removed the diploma privilege that the latter granted. W. Va. Code, 30-2-1, as amended, was an unconstitutional usurpation of the court's exclusive authority to regulate admission to the practice of law in West Virginia. Thus, the court held that the students of the law school at issue should be admitted to practice law without taking the Bar examination if they had met the other qualifications of West Virginia Rule 1.020.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1979, the West Virginia legislature passed an omnibus statute that radically changed the authority and operating procedures of the Public Service Commission. Part of this statute enacted a new section of the West Virginia code, namely, W. Va. Code 24A-2-2(a), that had the effect of deregulating the business of towing, hauling, or carrying wrecked or disabled vehicles. The lower court found that the title of the bill did not give notice that deregulation of wrecker services was part of the act and held the statute unconstitutional. The court affirmed. The purpose and effect of that new code section were not set forth in the title to the bill, as required by W. Va. Const., art. VI, &sect; 30. The line of authority that sustained acts of the legislature when the titles were comparatively vague was not controlling. The title was not infirm because it was vague and unspecific, but rather because it was positively misleading. From the title, it would have been reasonable for a person to conclude that the act did not touch the subject of wrecker services.</SPAN></P>

Probable cause was found by the Board, but the miners sought disqualification of some of the Board members and obtained an injunction against further proceedings. The Board member sought a writ of mandamus to compel the Director to suspend the miners' certificates until the hearing was held determining their fault in the explosion. The Director answered that it had no express authority to temporarily suspend certificates under W. Va. Code &sect; 22-1-1, et seq. The miners intervened, arguing that suspension of their certificates amounted to a denial of their right to due process. The court held that because safety was at issue, the temporary suspension of the miners' certificates did not deprive them of due process. The court held that it would not issue a writ to compel the Director to suspend the certificates; such suspension was a discretionary function and mandamus did not lie. However, the court ruled that the Director was authorized to promulgate regulations permitting temporary suspension and mandated him to do so.</SPAN></P>

The parents contended that W. Va. Code &sect; 18-5-13(6)(a) required the board to provide transportation and the board's failure to do so violated U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' children were enrolled in parochial school. Their action contended that the board unlawfully provided them with a stipend rather than providing school bus transportation to their schools. The court granted the mandamus, but overturned earlier precedent that held that the failure to provide bus transportation to parochial schools violated the Fourteenth Amendment. Providing bus transportation did not violate the First Amendment Establishment Clause or W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 15. However, the court held that the prior rule's Fourteenth Amendment analysis was improper. Later cases had shown that equal protection was not violated by a state's failure to aid and support parochial schools because that amendment permitted, but did not require, expenditure of government funds on parochial students. The parent's choice of a parochial, rather than public, school was a rational basis for treating the students differently. Thus, the county was not required to provide the same transportation options to all students. The county complied with state law when it provided an adequate stipend and allowed parochial students to ride school buses on established public school bus routes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ of mandamus as moulded.

The fee simple interest gave the railroad the right to lease the minerals under the land and the property owner had no claim on the value of the natural gas extracted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad leased the mineral rights of the land under the rail track to a lessee for removal of natural gas. The property owner argued that because the condemnation application of the predecessor railroad did not specifically request a fee simple interest, only a right-of-way could have been granted in view of general condemnation law that restricted the amount to be taken to that which is necessary for the public use. The railroad argued that because the final order in the condemnation proceeding expressly stated that a fee simple interest was awarded, it obtained such interest and that included the minerals. The court held that at the time of the condemnation proceeding, prior case law had construed language almost identical to that of the statute in effect to mean that unless a railroad specifically sought something less than a fee in its condemnation application, it obtained the fee. A provision in the statute gave a railroad company the discretionary right to take less than a fee by describing in its condemnation application an estate less than a fee. The court noted that it was reluctant to change the construction placed on the former condemnation statute by prior cases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court that construed the former statute to grant a fee simple interest, including mineral rights, to the railroad.</SPAN></P>

He sexually molested a 14-year-old boy who was a legislative page. The trial court convicted him of third-degree sexual assault.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that defendant failed to prove that the three-month delay in obtaining the indictment was prejudicial. The trial court did not commit reversible error by giving the flight instruction because defendant was aware of the indictment, failed to appear on the prescribed arraignment date, initially raised the issue, and presented evidence to show his reasons for leaving and for his voluntary return.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employees challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Boone County (West Virginia) that dismissed their action against appellee corporate officer under the West Virginia Wage Payment and Collection Act, W.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Employees sought to recover wages and fringe benefits under the West Virginia Wage Payment and Collection Act, W. Va. Code &sect; 21-5-1 et seq. (1981), when they were not paid upon the closing of the mine. Corporate officer's motion to dismiss the action against him individually was granted. The court reversed, finding that the act subjected officer to personal liability because it explicitly required all employers, be they natural persons, firms, or corporations, to comply with its provisions. The court found that the act envisioned personal liability because a possible penalty for a violation included imprisonment, which could not have possibly applied to a corporation. The court held that employees were not required to obtain an unsatisfied judgment against the corporate entity before proceeding against officer because the act did not create a suretyship relationship between corporation and officer, but rather, placed a quasi-public duty on individual officers to prevent corporate evasion of wage payments. The court rejected officer's contention that the act was unconstitutional finding that it required officer to act knowingly before imposing liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment dismissing employees' action against corporate officer for non-payment of wages upon the closing of the mine was reversed because the state wage law made officers personally liable for corporate violations of the wage law and did not require employees to obtain an unsatisfied judgment against the corporate entity first.</SPAN></P>

The county officials were obligated to provide personal hygiene supplies, clothing, laundry facilities, clean bedding, towels, writing materials and stamps, accessible visitation, medical care, and adequate exercise opportunity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners alleged that the city acted illegally in adopting the ordinance without first holding public hearings and without giving notice of the dates, times, and places of such hearings as required by W. Va. Code &sect; 8-24-44. The landowners sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages incurred as a result of the illegal zoning of their neighborhood from residential to commercial. The lower court granted their motion for summary judgment, finding as a matter of law that the failure of the city to provide public hearings and notice constituted a violation. Consequently, the lower court declared the zoning ordinance void. The lower court, however, found no actionable damages. The landowners contended that the rezoning blighted the neighborhood and caused a decline in property values, forcing them to relocate and sell their homes at a reduced value. They argued that the violation constituted a prima facie case of actionable negligence and that they possessed a private cause of action for damages. The court affirmed the lower court's order denying damages. The violation of the procedural statute did not give rise to a private cause of action for damages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Secretary of State of West Virginia filed an original petition for a writ of mandamus in which he requested that the court require respondents to recount the votes in a primary election in compliance with the procedures required in W. Va. Code, 3-4A-28(4) [1982]. The Secretary of State brought the action in his capacity as chief elections official under W. Va. Code, 3-1A-6, seeking to compel enforcement of the new recount provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Proximate to its effective date, a candidate for the State Senate requested a recount under the requirements of the newly effective provision of W. Va. Code, 3-4A-28(4). Respondents contended that the Secretary had no standing to bring the action and that because the effective date of its changes occurred after the primary, the new statute was not controlling. The court ruled that, where there was some ambiguity as to applicability of a given provision of the election law, it was only common sense to permit the Secretary of State to have standing to resolve the question by bringing an appropriate action. Moreover, generally, public officers had capacity to sue commensurate with their public duties without express statutory authority. Granting the writ, the court noted that there was nothing within the terms of the new amendments that specifically excluded their applicability to the primary election. The particular provision of W. Va. Code, 3-4A-28(4), involved a purely procedural rule, namely, how the recount was to be conducted. The recount provision was completely severable and had no impact on any substantive right that existed prior to the effective date of the enactment.</SPAN></P>

The court had original jurisdiction of this action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney general refused to represent the secretary of state or appoint special counsel in a civil action in which the secretary was a party defendant in his official capacity. The attorney general's position was inconsistent with the secretary's, who agreed with the plaintiff in the civil action. The court held that the secretary was entitled by law to representation by the attorney general. The attorney general's motion to dismiss for mootness was denied because the secretary had the right to appeal the underlying action and the substantial public policy issue could constantly reoccur. By the state constitution, the attorney general was an executive department officer, but did not have the common law powers of the office, but by the plain effect of the constitutional language had powers limited to those conferred by law. The court held that the secretary had no statutory authority to hire outside counsel and was forbidden by law from spending public funds to hire legal counsel. The secretary was totally dependent upon the attorney general for legal representation and by not receiving such, was deprived of his due process right to counsel and his right of access to the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court concluded that it was the duty of the attorney general to provide the secretary of state with adequate, effective legal representation. The writ was awarded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the board allegedly denied her application to take a bar examination, petitioner filed an action seeking review of the decision. The board denied the petitioner's application because she had not met the 30-day state residency requirement prior to taking the examination as prescribed by W. Va. Code of Rules for Admission to the Practice of Law 1.000. The court held the residency requirement was unconstitutional under the Privileges and Immunities Clause contained in U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it was unlawfully discriminatory against nonresidents. The court reasoned the board failed to show that nonresident lawyers constituted a peculiar source of the evil at which the residency requirement was aimed nor did it tender any plausible argument to support the contention that the residency requirement had a close relationship to the state's goal of a competent bar. The court rejected the board's argument that the residency requirement was needed to make sure attorneys were sufficiently acquainted with the law where an applicant was required to take an examination. The court concluded administrative inconvenience did not justify the discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The matter was before the court upon a certified question from an order of the Circuit Court of Logan County (West Virginia), which held that W. Va. Code &sect; 18-9A-11 (1977) was unconstitutional in an action brought by plaintiffs, board of education and its president, against defendant commission, seeking review of a decision approving the county assessor's tax assessment. Intervenor taxpayers joined in the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board of education and its president filed an action against the commission, seeking review of a decision by the board of equalization, which approved the county assessor's tax assessment. The trial court held that W. Va. Code &sect; 18-9A-11 was unconstitutional. On a certified question to the court, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling. The court concluded that the 50-100 percent provision of the statute resulted in fractional assessment and therefore violated W. Va. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1. The state constitution and the state code clearly contemplated that the assessor and his deputies should have possessed the necessary qualifications to appraise and assess property. The court concluded that the percentage ratio scheme contained in W. Va. Code &sect; 18-9A-11 resulted in fractional assessment, which was prohibited by the constitutional requirement of equal and uniform taxation as well as by &sect; 18-9A-11. Because W. Va. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1 required equal and uniform taxation in all areas of the state, both the method and the result of taxation were essential to compliance with the constitution. The court held that it was the duty of all county assessors to comply with the law.</SPAN></P>

The question involved the right of plaintiff, an unmarried woman, to accuse defendant of being the father of her children. The question involved interpretation of W. Va. Code &sect; 48-7-1 (1969), which sets forth provisions for bringing a bastardy action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The unmarried woman attempted to accuse defendant, to whom she was never married, of being the father or her children. The children were conceived while the woman was separated from her husband, and were born after the woman and her husband's divorce became final. The court held that the woman did not have a right to bring a bastardy action under W. Va. Code &sect; 48-7-1 (1969) as an unmarried woman, where the children were conceived during a lawful marriage, the marriage was dissolved prior to their birth, and the children were born within less than one year of the last known cohabitation with the woman's then husband. The court held that the one year separation requirement to bring an action under &sect; 48-7-1 was not an arbitrary rule in light of the statutory interests of protecting the legitimacy of children. The statute conclusively presumed that a child born within the one year separation period was legitimate and entitled to support from the husband. Thus, the children's constitutional rights to equal protection were not violated because &sect; 48-7-1 did not create two classes of illegitimate children. Finally, the woman's marital status at the time of the birth was not controlling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate was placed on three years probation for his conviction for embezzlement. The inmate's probation officer sought to revoke his probation because he had not paid the court costs and attorneys' fees as required by his probation agreement. The trial court revoked the inmate's probation and asserted that the record did not indicate that he did not have the money. The inmate's sentence was reinstated. The inmate sought a writ of habeas corpus. The court stated that trial courts had statutory authority to order repayment of costs and attorneys' fees from solvent defendants and they might make repayment a condition of probation. A probation condition requiring repayment of costs and attorneys' fees was constitutional if it was tuned to the probationer's ability to pay without undue hardship and was subjected to modification if his indigency persisted. However, the scant evidence did not justify revocation of the inmate's probation. There was no proof of wilful refusal to comply with the trial court's order, that he was contumacious. A trial court seeking to revoke probation for failure to pay assessed costs had to make findings of fact that indicated the ability to pay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By a petition for a writ of mandamus, petitioner child challenged the constitutionality of the loco parentis doctrine embodied in W. Va. Code &sect; 18A-5-1, insofar as it authorized respondent county board of education to permit respondent teacher to use corporal punishment to discipline students. The child also sought to compel respondent state board of education to promulgate regulations governing the imposition of corporal punishment in schools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child's complaint alleged that the teacher severely struck him with a paddle, in violation of both the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment in W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5 and the substantive due process provision in W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. The court rejected respondents' contention that mandamus was not an appropriate remedy in the circumstances. The child sought to enforce the public right, was a member of the class directly affected by the actions that allegedly infringed that right, and had no other effective remedy. The court declined to address the constitutional claims because the issue could be resolved under common law loco parentis doctrine that was embodied in the statute. In light of current standards, the doctrine did not permit corporal punishment of public school children by means of a paddle or other mechanical devices, and minimal procedural due process had to be afforded before manual corporal punishment could be utilized as a disciplinary measure. Accordingly, the court issued a writ of mandamus directing respondent state board to promulgate regulations regarding corporal punishment consistent with the standards in the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was held in contempt of court and incarcerated because he did not post a bond insuring his good conduct before the court.

On appeal, the court granted the writ of habeas corpus and held that a West Virginia circuit court did not have the power to require security for an attorney's good behavior; and refusal to obey a court order requiring such security did not constitute a basis for a contempt citation.

More contraband was later discovered in the trunk, and defendant was convicted for the possession. On appeal, defendant argued that 1) the initial stop and search were illegal; and 2) the trial judge acted prejudicially by imposing a heavier sentence simply because he exercised his right to a jury trial. The court reversed the conviction, holding that the officers did not have probable cause to stop and arrest its occupants. The court noted that asking a policeman directions was clearly insufficient to trigger an arrest. The court rejected the State's claim that a search was legal under the automobile exception because the vehicle had not been lawfully stopped. Finally, the court saw from the record that the trial court increased defendant's sentence because he stood trial instead of pleading guilty, as his co-defendant did. The court held that punishment could not be increased merely because a defendant decided to pursue his right to trial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted and his motion to set aside the verdict and for a new trial was denied. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded. In making its determination, the court applied the rule from an overruled case because defendant's trial was commenced before that case was overruled. Thus, the court held that defendant was entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal because there was a variance between the indictment and proof. Defendant was indicted as the &quot;sole perpetrator,&quot; but the evidence showed only that he had aided and abetted in the commission of the murder. The court held that double jeopardy did not bar a retrial of defendant upon an indictment charging him as an aider and abettor because the &quot;acquittal&quot; did not arise from any evidentiary insufficiency or any other prosecutorial or judicial &quot;bad faith,&quot; nor was it based upon a resolution of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action brought by appellees, an embalmer and funeral director, a funeral home, and a potential customer, appellants, the West Virginia Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors and others, sought review of a decision of the Kanawha County Circuit Court (West Virginia), which ruled that W. Va. Code &sect; 47-14-1 et seq. was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees challenged the constitutionality of W. Va. Code &sect; 47-14-1 et seq., which designated a recipient of money paid in advance for funeral-related goods and services, to be a trustee, and required that such money be deposited in a federally insured bank, trust company, or savings and loan association, in a separate account in the name of the trustee, held in trust subject to the terms of the contract by which it was paid, and that the fund may be recaptured by the purchaser. The court reversed a trial court ruling that the provisions were unconstitutional. The court overruled State v. Memorial Gardens Development Corp., 143 W.Va. 182, 101 S.E.2d 425 (1957), which decided that a predecessor statute was an unconstitutional, unwarranted exercise of the state's police power. Regulation of the funeral business was within the legitimate scope of state police power. The provisions did not prohibit appellees' business in any manner but simply regulated how a part of the business income would be handled to protect pre-need purchasers of funeral services.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder with a recommendation of mercy. The appellate court issued a writ of habeas corpus declaring defendant's conviction null and void. Defendant was then retried. On retrial, the Circuit Court of Raleigh County (West Virginia) entered judgment upon the jury's verdict, convicting defendant of first degree murder without a recommendation of mercy. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Initially, defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that they could not return a verdict providing for punishment in excess of murder in the first degree with a recommendation of mercy. The court rejected defendant's argument, holding that the proper procedure on retrial was to submit the case to the jury under proper instructions of every degree of homicide, which the evidence supported. However, the court noted that if the jury returned a verdict on retrial for an offense greater than that returned in the first trial, the trial court was required to enter judgment for the lesser offense. Accordingly, defendant contended that the trial court erred by failing to sentence him pursuant to a recommendation of mercy. The court agreed, holding that the trial court's imposition of a greater penalty than that imposed at the first trial was clearly erroneous. However, the court noted that the governor had commuted defendant's life sentence to a term of 5 to 18 years and, therefore, the court said that further discussion of this assignment of error was meaningless. The court rejected defendant's additional arguments and affirmed his conviction.</SPAN></P>

A few months later, the house was destroyed by fire. The insurer refused to pay because the policy had been cancelled. The homeowner brought an action. The trial court found for him and held that W.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was arrested, the police did not take him before a magistrate, as was required by W. Va. Code &sect; 62-1-5. Rather, they took him to city hall for questioning. After signing a waiver of rights form, defendant gave two statements. In the first statement, he denied committing the offense. An officer then told defendant that he would make a favorable recommendation to probation if defendant cooperated. Defendant then confessed. He contended that &sect; 61-8B-12 was unconstitutional, and that his confession was involuntary. In reversing the conviction, the court held that (1) &sect; 61-8B-12 was constitutional, and (2) the state did not meet its burden of proving that defendant's confession was voluntary. The court found that because defendant requested counsel after his first statement, the police should have ceased their interrogation. The court found that the officer's statement concerning the favorable probation recommendation to defendant went beyond the mere adjuration to tell the truth. The court noted that the statement was impermissibly calculated to foment a hope for leniency in defendant's mind and that it rendered the confession inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted under &sect; 61-8B-10 after he exposed himself to a female victim who happened to be the prosecuting attorney's secretary. Defendant had prior contact with the prosecuting attorney as the result of defendant's conviction for stealing materials from the prosecutor's houseboat. Defendant asserted that &sect; 61-8B-10 was unconstitutionally vague, that it was unconstitutional as applied to him, and that the trial court erred in denying his motion to disqualify the prosecuting attorney. The court reversed and remanded. Section 61-8B-10 was constitutional because it contained plain and unambiguous language as to what constituted an act of indecent exposure. But the statute was improperly applied against defendant in an indictment that failed to allege lack of consent of the victim. This was a necessary element of the crime and the failure to assert lack of consent made the indictment defective. Additionally, no evidence was produced at trial regarding the victim's lack of consent and therefore, the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction. Finally, under the facts, the prosecutor should have recused himself.</SPAN></P>

The check was returned to the store stamped &quot;account closed.&quot; At trial a ledger of her account was admitted into evidence showing that when she wrote the check, her account had been closed because it was overdrawn by a substantial sum. Such was offered to show that defendant knew that the check was worthless. Defendant challenged her conviction because the trial court admitted the ledger over her objection, refused to give two of her proffered instructions, and because W. Va. Code, 61-3-39 was unconstitutional. Affirming, the court held that the ledger was probative and admissible, although not conclusive proof of knowledge. The trial court's refusal to give the proffered instructions was not error where the instruction given listed all elements of the crime and proof required, including the factors set out in the refused instructions. The court found that the part of the statute that applied to defendant was constitutional and could stand alone; therefore, any constitutional infirmities in other subsections were immaterial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint did not set forth separately the amount of each original debt or the amount of interest owing on each. Further, the complaint was prepared and filed by the manager of the collection agency, a non-lawyer, and neither party was represented by counsel in the magistrate court. The court held that the complaint did not meet the requirements of W. Va. Code &sect; 50-4-1, which sets forth the requirements for filing a complaint by a commercial creditor. The default judgment entered thereupon was thus void. The court further found that W. Va. Code &sect; 50-4-4a, which authorizes a party appearing pro se in magistrate court to be assisted by a lay agent in certain circumstances, did not usurp the court's power to define and regulate the practice of law. Finally, the court found that the collection agency's appearance constituted the unauthorized practice of law and was not contemplated by W. Va. Code &sect; 50-4-4a. The collection agency instituted legal proceedings and appeared in magistrate court to prosecute the claims of the creditors. The assignment of those creditor's claims to the collection agency for purposes of enabling the agency to sue in its own name was a sham.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates claimed that they were routinely denied daily outdoor exercise, that they did not have access to a meaningful college course of instruction, and that they did not have available a meaningful work release program. The inmates argued that they were entitled to the benefits of W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 62-13-1 and 62-13-4 (Cum. Supp. 1980). The court agreed and granted the writ of mandamus. In doing so, the court held that the inmates incarcerated in West Virginia state prisons had a right to rehabilitation established by W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 62-13-1 and 62-13-4 (Cum. Supp. 1980), which was enforceable through the substantive due process mandate of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. Further, the Commissioner had not fulfilled his constitutional duty to faithfully execute the pertinent statutes requiring the establishment and maintenance of programs of classification, education, and treatment. Additionally, the Commissioner's plea of lack of funds was an insufficient justification for the failure to institute such programs. The court then set forth minimum guidelines for compliance with the statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the former owners failed to redeem the property, the purchaser bought the property from the state at a sale for non-payment of taxes. The sale was confirmed and a deed was executed conveying the property to the purchaser. The trial court ordered the former owners to vacate the premises. On appeal, the court held that the former owners did not receive notice consistent with due process principles. The former owners had a significant property interest protected by due process by virtue of their statutory entitlement to redeem delinquent property under W. Va. Code &sect; 11A-3-8 (1974). Because the former owners were of low educational achievement, rendering constructive notice by publication insufficient to apprise them of their duty to pay taxes, there was no evidence that notice was published in compliance with statute, the former owners did not regularly receive or read the local paper in which the required notice should have been published, and the former owners did not receive a tax ticket or other actual notice, a jurisdictional defect arose which rendered the tax deed void. The former owners were deprived of their property without sufficient notice.</SPAN></P>

Upon such reimbursement, the trial court was to enter a decree cancelling and setting aside the tax deed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed suit against the city and sought damages for losses they sustained when the city demolished their house. The lower court dismissed the suit because the city claimed the property owners had not given notice of their claim as required by W. Va. Code, 8-12-20. The court reversed because it found the period in which to give notice to the city was six months. Because the applicable version of W. Va. Code, 8-12-20 became effective before the demolition of their house, the property owners were subject to the six month notice requirement, not the thirty day requirement previously declared unconstitutional in O'Neil v. City of Parkersburg, 160 W. Va. 694, 237 S.E.2d 504 (1977). The court found while W. Va. Code, 8-12-20 required an individual contemplating an action against a municipality to give written notice of the nature of the claim and of the time and place at which the injury is alleged to have occurred within six months, there was a clear intent by the legislature to allow substantial compliance with the provisions of W.

The court held that Exemption B provided a reasonable vehicle for both balancing and reconciling the competing aims of state education and the proper exercise of First Amendment, free exercise rights. The standard for qualifying under the exemption was not unconstitutionally vague because the language &quot;qualified to give instruction in subjects required to be taught in free elementary schools&quot; was sufficiently definite that an arbitrary and capricious refusal by the county superintendent and county board of education to grant approval to qualified instructors could be corrected either by an action for declaratory judgment or an action in mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">W. Va. Code &sect; 48-8-1 (1961) made it a criminal offense for a parent to refuse to provide for the support of a child without lawful excuse.A warrant was issued against appellee putative father. Appellant mother sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Lewis County (West Virginia), which dismissed the warrant in accordance with W. Va. Code &sect; 48-7-1 (1969) because the action had not been brought within three years of the child's birth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 48-7-1 permitted an unmarried woman to attempt to establish paternity of an illegitimate child within three years of the child's birth as a foundation for a continuing obligation of support. The mother gave birth to an illegitimate child. The mother asserted that an action to enforce a parent's obligation to support a legitimate child could be brought at any time from birth until the child became 18 years old. Section 48-7-1 completely barred an illegitimate child from enforcing the obligation of support unless the question of paternity was established within three years of his birth, even though W. Va. Code &sect; 48-8-1 (1961) imposed an obligation on parents to support both their legitimate and illegitimate children. The court found that the three-year statute of limitations of W. Va. Code &sect; 48-7-1 (1969) was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 10, 17. The unequal treatment of legitimate and illegitimate children bore no substantial relationship to a permissible state interest. The court found that the statute of limitations of W. Va. Code &sect; 48-7-1 (1969) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tax commissioner (commissioner) filed actions against defendants, county officials and sureties, in order to recover salary overpayments. The Circuit Court of Randolph County (West Virginia) granted the motions of the county officials and the sureties to dismiss the actions. The commissioner appealed the judgment which granted the motion of the sureties to dismiss the action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon taking office, the county officials entered into written agreements with the sureties for their official bonds. After legislative amendments which had authorized salary increases for the county officials were declared unconstitutional, the commissioner advised them that they were to repay their salary increases. The commissioner filed actions against the county officials and the sureties after an audit revealed that they had failed to return their salary increases to the county treasury. The trial court granted the motions of the county officials and the sureties to dismiss the actions. The commissioner appealed. Upon review, the court reversed the judgment as to the sureties. The court held that that the salary overpayments fell within the provisions of the surety agreements, and that the salary overpayments were monies that were received by virtue of the county officials' offices within the meaning of W. Va. Code &sect; 6-2-3 (1923). The court held that the bonds were breached within the meaning of &sect; 6-2-3 upon the failure of the public officials to return the salary overpayments to the county treasury, and therefore the sureties were liable on the bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment to the extent that it dismissed the commissioner's action against the sureties for salary overpayments that were not repaid by the county officials. The court entered judgment for the commissioner against the sureties for the amount of the salary overpayments.</SPAN></P>
