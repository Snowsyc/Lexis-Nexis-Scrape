</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of District Court of Campbell County (Wyoming) order compelling appellant, as convicted felon, to submit deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples as part of DNA Identification Record System established by Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-19-401 through 7-19-406 (LEXIS 1999), contending it violated U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act establishing state deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) database identification system, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-19-401 through 7-19-406 (LEXIS 1999) (Act), required that every person who was in custody because of felony conviction, provide DNA tissue sample. Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-19-403(a) (LEXIS 1999). Appellant was convicted for conspiracy to commit larceny. In addition to imprisonment and fine, court ordered he supply DNA sample. Appellant objected Act violated U.S. Const. amend. IV's guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures. On appeal, court affirmed, holding Act was constitutional. Collecting deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples either from blood, saliva, or hair, through routine, unobtrusive procedures was minimally intrusive. Parolees and juvenile probationers had lesser U.S. Const. amend. IV protections than those of law abiding citizens. Convicted felons had diminished privacy rights. Act's purpose in collecting DNA identification information was to advance legitimate state interest in criminal law enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order was affirmed because once person was convicted of felonies, his identity became matter of state interest and he lost any legitimate expectation of privacy in identifying information derived from blood sampling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought writ of certiorari, challenging denial of pretrial motions. In affirming the rulings, the court held that petitioner's speedy trial right was not violated, as petitioner consented to delays through express waivers and continuance motions. The trial court properly denied the remand motion for a meaningful preliminary hearing as no right to discovery at that stage of a criminal proceeding exists. Further, the slight inaccuracy in the affidavit supporting the search warrant request did not affect the warrant's or the search's validity, and the warrant was supported by sufficient facts to establish probable cause. Wiretap evidence was properly admitted, as Wyoming's Communication Interception Act did not require a court order before obtaining information through electronic devices where a participant consented to the conversation's recording and transmission. Finally, the use of transmitting and recording devices in petitioner's home did not violate his state constitutional right against unreasonable search and seizure.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's orders denying pretrial motions were affirmed as wiretap evidence was properly obtained with the consent of a participant to the conversation and as the use of electronic eavesdropping equipment did not violate petitioner's state constitutional rights against unreasonable searches.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted by a jury on three counts of misdemeanor check fraud and one count of felony defrauding an innkeeper. On appeal defendant contended the jury instruction regarding prima facie evidence of intent that a check should not be paid, but which did not include the words prima facie, contained an unconstitutional mandatory presumption requiring the jury to find the intent element was satisfied once the predicate facts that defendant did not have sufficient funds in his account, and that he failed to pay the checks within five days after receiving notices of dishonor, were proven. The court disagreed, holding that the trial court had not directed the jury it must consider the intent element of the crimes as having been established once the predicate facts were proven, and thus, although framed in mandatory language, the challenged instruction included a permissive inference rather than a mandatory presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions, holding the trial court's jury instruction on evidence constituting a prima facie showing of intent that a check should not be paid, which did not include the words prima facie, although framed in mandatory language, included a permissive inference rather than a mandatory presumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's driver's license was suspended for driving under the influence pursuant to Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-6-103(b) when an officer gave him a breath test that indicated an alcohol concentration in excess of statutorily allowed levels. After appellant was granted three continuances, the suspension was upheld in an administrative hearing. Appellant challenged the district court's decision affirming the administrative hearing officer's decision. The court held that, pursuant to Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-6-103(c), the information appellant requested before the hearing was not discoverable in a contested case hearing. Appellant was not denied due process and confrontation rights when the arresting officer did not appear because appellant failed to subpoena him. Appellant's argument that the officer did not properly observe him prior to the breath test failed because the officer's sworn statement said he observed appellant, and appellant did not engage in activities which might affect the test results.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the driver's license suspension because appellant had requested nondiscoverable information for the contested case hearing; appellant failed to subpoena the arresting officer so could not claim denial of constitutional rights when he did not appear; and the officer's sworn statement indicated he had utilized proper procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declined to address substantive issues raised by parties, but addressed constitutional propriety of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-14-128. The statutory requirement to impose sanctions for improper court filings, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-14-128, was inconsistent with the Wyoming Rules of Civil Procedure because the statute was silent concerning the procedures to be used and the contents of the order imposing sanctions, while the rules spelled out the specific requirements. Since the prescription of practice and procedure attending the imposition of sanctions for signing and filing of papers with the courts was a procedural, not a substantive, matter, the legislature was prohibited from enacting statutes pertaining to such matter under Wyo. Const. art. 2, &sect; 1 and Wyo. Const. art. 5, &sect; 2. In Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-14-128, the legislature impermissibly enacted a statute pertaining to a procedural matter; therefore, the court held that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped for suspicion of drunk driving. While defendant was in custody, an officer noticed spent gun casings in the bed and passenger compartment of defendant's truck. Upon a warrantless weapons search, the officers found cocaine. Defendant also made incriminating statements. The trial court denied defendant's motions to suppress. Defendant then conditionally pled guilty and appealed. The court held the stop was justified and the statements were admissible. The court found that under U.S. Const. amend. IV, Belton permitted the police to conduct a warrantless vehicle search of the entire vehicle contemporaneous to a lawful custodial arrest of the vehicle's occupant. The court concluded that Wyoming's constitutional rule was narrower than the federal counterpart. Nonetheless, the court held the search was permissible because the area searched was within an occupant's reach.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court upheld legislation of a funding limit of $ 250,000.00 in Hold Harmless funding, applicable only to recapture/Grey area school districts. Appellant school district sought review arguing that the legislation was unconstitutional and void under the equal protection provisions of Wyo. Const. art. III, &sect; 27 and art. I, &sect; 34 because no such limit applied to any other school district. The supreme court affirmed the ruling that the transitional funding legislation did not interfere with educational rights, but was part of a process in which all districts would eventually be funded on a cost basis. The court held that the right to funding in excess of its costs was not a protected fundamental right. The court upheld the legislation under the rational relationship test as no class was been harmed by the transitional legislation and the program had a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest in making the transition to a cost-based school funding system. Finally, the court found that the legislation did not violate the equal protection provisions of the Wyoming Constitution as it did not interfere with the right to a proper public education.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of aggravated assault, arguing that Wyo. Stat.

Defendant also asserted that the lower court improperly instructed the jury on the elements of the crime.

Thus, a mental element was not required. Further, the trial court adequately instructed the jury on all elements of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought to overturn his guilty plea to one count of taking indecent liberties with a minor on the ground that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and that the district court improperly ordered appellant to submit to a psychosexual evaluation, which was used for sentencing. On appeal, the court affirmed. Appellant failed to move the appellate court for remand, but rather argued his ineffectiveness claim in his appellate brief. The court was unable to consider appellant's affidavit in appellate proceedings. The court relied solely upon the record of trial proceedings to make a determination of the voluntariness of his plea. While ineffective counsel can render a guilty plea involuntary, there was no record for such a claim. The only contention supported by the record was the absence of a motion to suppress. If the failure to move to suppress was a trial tactic, it was not judged as unconstitutionally ineffective. The psychosexual evaluation was relevant in establishing appellant's danger to the community and in informing the district court of his prospects for rehabilitation. Under the law, there was no error in ordering or considering the evaluation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed a judgment from the District Court of Natrona County (Wyoming), which convicted him of one count of aggravated assault and battery in violation of Wyo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant made several threats to his prior girlfriend and others, and was arrested. Thereafter, he pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated assault and battery in violation of Wyo. Stat.

Before sentencing, defendant discharged his court-appointed attorney and retained new counsel. He then moved to withdraw his pleas of guilty. The trial court denied the motion without a hearing and sentenced defendant. On appeal, the court held that the refusal to grant a hearing or permit defendant to withdraw his pleas amounted to an abuse of discretion. Taking the claims of ineffective assistance as true, the court found the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel constituted a fair and just reason to grant the motion to withdraw. It then determined that &sect; 6-6-103 was not void for vagueness or overbroad and therefore was constitutional. Thus, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court to either grant defendant's motion or conduct a hearing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed. The appeals court affirmed because, although the court did err in failing to make specific findings regarding facts in defendant's presentence report that he controverted, defendant failed to show that the error prejudiced him because the court did not rely on the controverted facts in the report when imposing the sentence. Thus, the issue was remanded for the limited purpose of allowing the trial court to make those findings as required under Wyo. R. Crim. P. 32(a)(3)(C). Moreover, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the indecent liberties charges because, although prosecutor dismissed the charges before defendant's trial, prosecutor could refile charges as long as defendant was not prejudiced. In addition, defendant did not show the prosecutor's failure to provide a timely preliminary hearing on those charges required that the charges be dismissed with prejudice; thus, court did not err in denying his motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that an administrative agency had no authority to determine the constitutionality of a statute.

The District Court of Platte County, Wyoming, agreed with the citizen and granted her motion for summary judgment. The board appealed. The citizen also appealed, requesting attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board established elected county official salaries for the upcoming term. In addition to setting base salaries, the board adopted a resolution whereby it could grant cost of living adjustment (COLA) raises not to exceed eight percent of each official's annual salary. Because both parties agreed that no facts were in dispute, the COLA raise issue presented only a question of law. Because of retained discretion, the salaries of the county officials were not fixed, but subject to an increase after election. To allow the board to pay the COLA raises would allow it to perform an unconstitutional act. Under these circumstances, the COLA raises violated Wyo. Const. art. 3, &sect; 32.

Plaintiff challenged defendant's assessment, arguing that the assessment violated Wyo. Const. art. 15, &sect; 11, uniform tax principles, and the valuation and the methodology used to obtain it, were not supported by substantial evidence or by any authority. The court held that under article 15, &sect; 11, defendant was required to assess property taxes in a uniform manner, and because plaintiff's property was assessed in a different manner than IOU's, the assessments were not made in a uniform manner. The court also determined that defendant did not have any statutory or regulatory authority to assess plaintiff's property in a manner differently from IOU's, and there was no evidence to support the different assessment. The court concluded that the tax was on the property, not the owner, and a valuation for tax purposes must value the property, not the ownership type.

The court found that the patient assigned to the department her right to receive payment for medical care from a third party when she applied for Medicaid benefits. The court found that as between the patient and the department, this assignment was sufficient to ensure reimbursement. The court also found that the department was not required to file or perfect a lien against the patient because the statute allowed the department to be fully reimbursed for Medicaid payments made on behalf of a recipient who recovered those payments from a liable third party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dentist contended that the board's refusal to accept regional examinations other than the Central Regional Dental Testing Service Examination (CRDTS) was arbitrary and capricious. The dentist argued that because the statute did not require the board to designate one regional examination over another, the board's designation of the CRDTS arbitrarily discriminated against substantially similar examinations. The supreme court held that given the board's broad discretion to determine the proper written and practical examinations for licensure in Wyoming, there was no abuse of the board's discretion in requiring an applicant to pass an examination which tested the qualifications of the applicant. The court noted that failure to grant the dentist a license based on reciprocity was permissible because it was pursuant to the language of the statute, that there was no fundamental right involved in the practice of medicine, that states had a compelling interest in protecting public health and safety such that they had broad power to establish standards for licensing and regulating dentists, and that the dentist was not denied due process as was evidenced by his appearance at a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was caught with 24.49 grams of water that tested positive for the presence of amphetamine. The weight of the water was used to determine the weight of the controlled substance, and the amount was sufficient to charge the defendant with felony possession of a controlled substance. On appeal, the defendant contended that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 35-7-1031(d) was unconstitutionally vague. The defendant argued that no person of ordinary intelligence would be put on notice that using water as a catalyst to smoke a controlled substance would elevate the action to conduct that could result in a felony conviction. The appellate court rejected the defendant's contention and affirmed. The statute was clear that the weight of any other substance containing a quantity of an illegal drug should have been added to the weight of a controlled substance to raise the crime of possession from a misdemeanor to a felony. Therefore, the defendant failed to show that the language of the statute was unconstitutionally vague or was applied in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner in his case.</SPAN></P>

The district court determined that the insured's exclusive remedy was administrative and that such remedy had not been exhausted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured participated in a health plan administered by the insurer. The insured's doctors recommended that he have back surgery to alleviate his chronic pain. The insurer, through its utilization review process, determined that the insured should undergo conservative treatment of steroid injections in lieu of surgery. The insured eventually had the surgery, without authorization, and was reimbursed at the 60 percent penalty rate. Although the claim was eventually paid in full, the insured brought an action alleging numerous torts against the insurer. The court determined that summary judgment was inappropriate. Neither the Wyoming statute,&nbsp;Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-3-205 (1997), nor the terms of the insurance contract provided that the grievance procedure was the exclusive remedy for complaints against the utilization review process. The insurer did not provide an appropriate appeals process for the denial of treatment decisions and effectively denied the insured the benefits of the coverage to which he was entitled. The plain language of the contract provided only for an internal appeals and grievance process for a claim for payment and not for the utilization review process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nurse's license as an ANP was a conditional property right and encompassed a liberty interest, similar to other types of licensed rights to work. Statutes, as well as constitutional provisions, required due process before a license could be infringed upon by an administrative agency. The nurse's license to practice, a property right, and her right to earn a living, a liberty interest, were so fundamental that such rights could not have been restricted by agency action without the agency first giving notice of the alleged grounds for sanctions. Notice was required constitutionally and by statute. The Board filed its own complaint against the nurse and suspended her license for one month on the basis of matters entirely foreign to that complaint. Such lack of due process was prohibited by the Wyoming and United States Constitutions, and violated Wyo. Stat. &sect; 16-3-113(c). The Board's failure to give the nurse notice required that its action be set aside because it was contrary to constitutional right and without observance of procedure required by law. The Board's failure to afford due process to the nurse was dispositive of the matter.</SPAN></P>

The licensee filed a motion for a declaratory judgment providing that &sect; 12-5-101(a) and the City's ordinance were unconstitutional. The City filed a motion to dismiss the action pursuant to Wyo. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) on the basis that it failed to state a claim upon which relief could have been granted. The contested judgment was affirmed. The court held that the licensee's complaint failed to state a claim because it did not assert that the restriction on its hours differed from those for any other licensees. The court concluded that, even if the facts asserted by the licensee were true, they did not support its claim of an equal protection violation. The licensee failed to assert that either the State's amendment or the City's ordinance treated it differently from other licensees.

Additionally, the court held that the plain language of the wrongful death statute did not lend itself to application of the discovery rule. The court did, however, uphold the trial court's denial of the individual's motion to dismiss. The court held that the statute required a personal representative to bring a wrongful death action, and the trial court could not appoint a personal representative until the decedent's identity was known.

Upon review, the court held that defendant's constitutional challenge had to fail because defendant had fair notice of the prohibited conduct, and there was no evidence that the statute was enforced in a discriminatory manner. However, the court reversed the judgment because under the jury instructions that were given, the jury was not properly informed as to the circumstances under which defendant could be convicted of the crime of taking indecent liberties with the victim, and thus the error was prejudicial. The court held that although the victim's consent was not a complete defense, it was a material factor to be considered in the jury's deliberations when considering whether the State proved that defendant had taken &quot;indecent or immoral&quot; liberties with the her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff board of county commissioners challenged the decision of the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming), which entered judgment for defendants, a State governor and State treasurer, in plaintiff's action alleging that Wyoming's statutory provision providing for the establishment and funding of a county court in counties with a population of less than 30,000 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue arose under the equal protection and uniform operation of the laws requirements found in the Constitution of the State of Wyoming. Plaintiff's county, with a population of less than 30,000, was denied full funding to establish a county court, while the state legislature approved full funding for a county court in other counties having a population of less than 30,000. The court held that the statutory provision did not facially violate the state constitution as special legislation, as there was rational reasons why the legislature could deny funding of county courts in counties having a population of less than 30,000. However, there was nothing in the record that would serve to justify the approval of funding for county courts in six other counties with populations of less than 30,000 while denying funding for a county court in plaintiff's county. As the statute was applied, WYO. STAT. &sect; 5-5-103, did not operate alike upon all counties in the same or similar circumstances. The differentiation was not justified. Therefore, the statute, as it was applied, was unconstitutional as special legislation in violation of Article 3, &sect; 27 of the Constitution of the State of Wyoming.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant worked at a women's correctional center as a correctional officer. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by discovering a dead inmate.

She challenged the constitutionality of W.S. 1977 &sect;27-14-102(a)(xi)(J) (Wyoming), which precluded recovery for a mental injury unaccompanied by a physical injury. The claimant contended that the statute created an unconstitutional classification when it distinguished between one class of workers who suffered a compensable injury because of a physical injury and another class of workers who suffered a noncompensable mental injury. Affirming the denial of benefits, the court noted that since the filing of the claimant's appeal, it had decided the precise issue and held that denying coverage for a mental injury did not violate equal protection guarantees because the classifications bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state objective, namely, the economic concerns and burdens associated with mental injury. That decision was dispositive of the issue presented by the claimant.</SPAN></P>

He argued that the statute should be overturned or, in the alternative, that his sentence was disproportionate to his crimes. The evidence showed that a woman was killed in the course of a burglary and defendant was involved. Defendant argued that there should be an affirmative defense to the felony murder rule that would apply if a defendant satisfied a list of conditions refuting culpability. The court found that such a defense, refuting the strict responsibility given by the felony murder rule, would be a matter of legislative authority. With regard to the sentence, the State conceded that the sentence imposed for the aggravated burglary conviction, the underlying conviction for the purposes of the felony murder conviction, was improper as multiple punishments for felony murder and the underlying felony were impermissible. A life sentence for the felony murder conviction, however, was not grossly disproportionate to the crime nor was the 4 to 5 year sentence for conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State collected fuel taxes which were required, by WYO. CONST. Art. 15, &sect; 16, to be distributed solely for highway funding. The State also collected mineral severance taxes, but their distribution was not limited by the constitution. Before 1989, a portion of those taxes was distributed to highway funding. In 1989, the Underground Storage Tank Act was enacted and funded by mineral severance tax revenues. To offset the consequent revenue loss to the highway fund, the legislature levied a fuel tax which was directly distributed to the State highway fund. The court affirmed. It found that the taxpayer's proof of fraud was a bare allegation that the transfers were designed by the legislature with an intent to circumvent the constitution. Such proof was insufficient to state a claim for fraud which had to be established by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence. The court held that the statutory scheme did not violate WYO. CONST. Art. 15, &sect; 16. The court found no violation of the constitution when the legislature chose to state the disposition of the tax revenue in a different subsection from the one imposing the tax.</SPAN></P>

In the employee's appeal, which he filed against appellees, his employer and the State of Wyoming, ex rel. Wyoming Worker's Compensation Division, the District Court of Uinta County (Wyoming) certified the case for review. Issues were presented, in part, under Wyo. Stat. &sect; 27-14-108 (Cum.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee, who did maintenance in a mobile home park, was hurt in a fall. He argued that while worker's compensation coverage for such parks was excluded under Wyo. Stat. &sect; 27-14-108(h)(v)(F), he had duties that were extrahazardous and covered under Wyo. Stat. &sect; 27-14-108(d). The court rejected that claim, explaining that the legislature had a right to determine that some industries did not constitute extrahazardous employment and that the mobile home industry was in that category. Thus, the employer was exempted from providing coverage. Further, the court explained, if an employer's activities were not extrahazardous, then it was not material that an employee's activities were hazardous. Wyo. Stat. &sect; 27-14-108(c) applied only where &sect; 27-14-108(a) did not require all employees to be covered by worker's compensation and where &sect; 27-14-108(h) did not exempt all employees of an industry from coverage. The court also ruled that the classification that exempted mobile home parks had a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state interest and that it did not violate due process or equal protection, or Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 3 and 7, or the requirement in Wyo. Const. art. 10, &sect; 4.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued double jeopardy violations in connection with his conviction and license suspension. The court affirmed the conviction on the ground that Wyoming's implied consent laws, WYO. STAT. &sect; 31-6-102, providing for suspension of a driver's license for driving while under the influence, did not constitute &quot;punishment&quot; for purposes of double jeopardy. Because the administrative license suspension did not constitute punishment, Wyoming and its municipalities could convict and sentence a person for DWUI and subject the driver to an administrative license suspension. Wyoming's implied consent law and its administrative license suspension procedures were intended to facilitate the tests for intoxication and remove drunk drivers from the highways. As such, they properly imposed a condition on the right to operate a motor vehicle on the streets and highways of the state and did not constitute punishment for purposes of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The hearing examiner granted summary judgment for the employer on the ground that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27-14-102(a)(xi)(J) (Supp. 1996) excluded any mental injury from the definition of injury for workers' compensation purposes unless the mental injury was caused by a compensable physical injury. The employee claimed that such classifications violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the Wyoming and the United States Constitutions because the classifications did not serve a legitimate state interest. The court found no constitutional violation and affirmed the judgment for the employer. Considering the inexactness of mental injuries and the state's legitimate interest in providing a cost-effective workers' compensation program free of frivolous and fraudulent claims, the court concluded that the employee failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that the classifications were not rationally related to a legitimate state objective. The court determined that the statute satisfied the rational basis test and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowner sought review of a judgment of the Justice of the Peace Court (Wyoming), which convicted him on three counts of unlawful subdivision of land. The landowner claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict, that Wyo. Stat. &sect; 18-5-301 et seq. (1996) was void for vagueness, and Wyo. Stat. &sect; 18-5-314 (1996) violated constitutional provisions regarding double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In January 1994 the landowner conveyed 40 of his 1000 acres to his mother and stepfather. Then he conveyed 40 acres to himself and his wife, and he and his wife conveyed 20 of those acres to third parties. Several months later he and his wife conveyed 20 acres, and he conveyed 10 of his remaining acres, to his mother and stepfather. During August 1994 he installed a backbone electrical system on the property. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict that he had unlawfully subdivided his property even though he never made a single conveyance dividing his property into three or more parcels. To require &quot;subdividing&quot; to involve a conveyance dividing property into three parcels would render the statute meaningless, as it would allow subdivision through numerous conveyances of one lot at a time. Moreover, the jury was entitled to consider each charge of illegal subdivision in light of all the evidence. Wyo. Stat. &sect; 18-5-301 et seq. (1996) was not void for vagueness because a person of average intelligence could understand what conduct was made illegal, and Wyo. Stat. &sect; 18-5-314 (1996) was not applied in a way that exposed the landowner to double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The case was certified to the court by the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner recorded her brand in August 1985. The rerecording receipt indicated that the brand had been renewed on January 13, 1986, and that it had to be rerecorded in 1995. During the 1994 legislative session, the Wyoming legislature amended Wyo. Stat. &sect; 11-20-115, changing the date by which the owner was required to rerecord her brand. Sometime after the sixty-day grace period which was allowed in &sect; 11-20-115(a) for rerecording brands had expired, the owner contacted the board, seeking to renew her brand. The board informed her that she had missed the deadline and that she had thereby abandoned her brand. Affirming, the court held in part that although the owner's property interest in her brand gave her a significant interest in receiving notice, that interest could not justify the extreme burden that would be placed on the board if it was required to locate the current address for every brand owner who moved without giving it a change of address. The notice procedure followed by the board had been reasonably calculated to reach the owner.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the district court committed no abuse of discretion when it ruled three of the four factors articulated in &sect; 1-22-108(c) weighed against the father and in favor of the adoptive parents. Although the father expressed an interest in the child, the court found that he did not prove responsibility for the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother had been married to the presumed father at the time of the child's birth, even though the child was not mentioned in the parties' divorce. The district court ruled that because no timely action had been brought to declare the nonexistence of a father and child relationship between the child and the presumed father, the statutory presumption under Wyo. Stat. &sect; 14-2-102 had become absolute. On review, the court had to affirm. The plain language of Wyo. Stat. &sect; 14-2-104(a)(ii) required that an action to declare the nonexistence of a parent and child relationship had to be brought within a reasonable time and, in any event, no later than five years after the child's birth. Because no such action was brought, the presumption could have no longer been challenged. The provisions that limited the time for bringing such actions were appropriate because they promoted the child's entitlement to legitimacy. Wyo. Stat. &sect; 14-2-105 did not apply because the child in the instant matter had a presumed father. There was a compelling social policy in the presumption of legitimacy.</SPAN></P>

The Department concluded that the father bore the burden of proof at the hearing. The Department applied the substantial evidence standard and affirmed the agency's findings. Upon review, the court found that the burden of proof in the contested hearing was upon the agency because the agency was the proponent of the order holding that the child abuse allegations were substantiated. The appropriate standard of proof in the contested hearing was the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard applied by the hearing officer. The Department's rules that limited the issues in a contested case hearing to a determination of whether the agency acted in accordance with law did not comply with the Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act because it prevented the Department from conducting a full review of the factual issues.</SPAN></P>

However, after various administrative decisions the lessee's permit languished with the Council pending the adjournment of the Wyoming legislature. Thus, the lessee ultimately withdrew its application and filed a complaint with the trial court alleging that the State temporarily and permanently deprived the lessee of the benefits of owning its mining lease without providing just compensation and deprived it of its procedural and substantive due process rights.

The court determined that the lessee failed to sustain its burden of establishing that it was excused by reason of futility from exhausting its administrative remedies.

Defendant's counsel made an oral motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and improper venue. The district court denied the motion to dismiss. Defendant entered a conditional plea of guilty. On appeal, defendant contended that the venue provision of Wyoming's Juvenile Court Act was unconstitutional and that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for lack of venue. Further, defendant contended that the Act was violative of Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10; and was violative of his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and under Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 6. The court affirmed and held that the venue provision of the Act was constitutional, and that the district court correctly denied the motion to dismiss. The venue provision in Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 did not apply to juvenile delinquency proceedings which were, instead, controlled by Wyo. Stat. &sect; 14-6-204. A juvenile delinquency determination was a special proceeding, not a traditional criminal proceeding. Finally, since venue was proper defendant's due process claim failed.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the Wyoming Legislature passed the Act and made its application retroactive to sex offenders of children. Defendant petitioned the district court to release him from the duty to register under the Act on the grounds that the statute's purpose would not be served by his registration as he was not a pedophile or hebephile. The district court ruled the Act was constitutional and denied his petition. The court affirmed and held that the plain reading of the Act indicated that the legislature intended to facilitate law enforcement and protection of children. The sexual offender registration did not inflict greater punishment and did not violate the ex post facto clause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the District Court of Uinta County (Wyoming), defendant entered a plea of no contest to one count of indecent liberties with a minor. The plea agreement was conditional, reserving the right to challenge the constitutionality of the indecent liberties with a minor statute,&nbsp;Wyo.Stat. &sect; 14-3-105. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant engaged in assignations with a victim. At the time, defendant was 30 years old and the victim was a 16-year-old girl. Defendant capitalized upon the vulnerability of the victim. Defendant transported the victim across a number of state lines, ostensibly for the purpose of locating a place where they might lawfully marry. Finding such a legal union to be impossible, they returned to Wyoming, where the victim discovered that she was pregnant and defendant developed another relationship with a 17-year-old girl. On the instant appeal, citing Wyo.Stat. &sect;&sect; 6-2-307 and 14-3-105 (1988), the court rejected defendant's contention that marriage to the victim would obviate the charged offense and terminate his prosecution. The court rejected defendant's theory that uncertainty as to the statutory prohibition made prosecution for the offense unlikely absent law enforcement authorities who invoked religious values to guide them in arrest and prosecution. The court found no basis for defendant's vagueness challenge to &sect; 14-3-105 as applied to his behavior. The court rejected the assertion that the statute ran afoul of constitutionally mandated separation of church and state.</SPAN></P>

The PSC refused to transfer the certificate of necessity from the association to the purchasers until the parties agreed on a price of not more than 1.7 times the net book value of the telephone exchanges, and the association and the purchasers appealed. The court held that the statutory scheme that created and empowered the PSC, Wyo. Stat. &sect;&sect; 37-2-101 to 37-2-221 (1977 &amp; Cum.

STAT. &sect; 16-3-114(c)(ii)(D). The EQC determined that mailing notice to the address of legal record satisfied the legal requirements of mailing notice to the objector. Because she had actual notice, timely filed an objection, and did not ask for a continuance, the court concluded she did not show prejudice. The court also concluded that the objectors had not demonstrated prejudice with their claim that the content of the notice did not comply with the statute or agency rules and regulations. The notice served to inform adjoining property owners that a significant revision to a mining permit was under consideration. In claiming they were denied their due process rights, the objectors did not show that a protected property interest had been affected in an impermissible way.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Several school districts brought an action against the state and other districts, seeking a declaration and injunctive relief that the public school finance system was unconstitutional. The districts attacked five components of the school finance system, including the divisor, municipal divisor, recapture, optional mills, and the capital construction features of the system. The district court found the municipal divisor, recapture, and optional mills features unconstitutional while the divisor and capital construction features were constitutional. Upon review, the court held that deficient physical facilities deprived students of an equal educational opportunity and any financing system that allowed such deficient facilities to exist was unconstitutional. Further, the present capital construction scheme was infirm and failed to pass muster. The court held that the state had the burden of proving funding disparities were cost-justified or that a compelling reason justified disparity. A review of the findings of fact revealed that the disparities caused by the distribution formula were not cost-based.</SPAN></P>

The juveniles sought to inhibit the discretion of the prosecuting attorney and the discretion of the trial court with respect to the prosecution of young offenders as adults in the district court. The court affirmed the decisions in both courts. The court held that the courts did not commit an abuse of discretion in reaching their conclusions because the courts carefully considered all of the evidence produced at the transfer hearings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant conditionally pled guilty to one of four charges he faced: taking indecent liberties with a child. Defendant was accused of having anal intercourse with a young boy. Defendant argued that under the facts, he should have been charged with the crime of third-degree sexual assault as described in W.S. &sect; 6-2-304(a) (1) (Wyoming) instead of with the crime of indecent liberties as described in W.S. &sect; 14-3-105 (Wyoming). In affirming the conviction, the court held that the third-degree sexual assault statute,&nbsp;&sect; 6-2-304(a) (1), did not apply to the instant facts because the victim was born on May 6, 1977, and defendant's date of birth was February 14, 1974. Section 6-2-304(a) (i), therefore, did not apply because defendant was less than four years older than his victim was. In addition, the court also upheld defendant's constitutionally vague challenge to &sect; 14-3-105 because the statute provided sufficient notice to a person of ordinary intelligence that defendant's conduct was illegal, and because the statute was not arbitrarily or discriminatorily enforced.</SPAN></P>

The custodian attacked the constitutionality of Wyo. Stat.

The crux of the custodian's position was that it infringed upon his fundamental right to liberty in the rearing of his children without undue governmental interference.

The court ruled that the legislature could regulate and require licensure of professionals as it saw fit but any law in furtherance of the police power must be reasonable and not arbitrary. Further, the court held that while there was no prohibition against a reasonable classification of persons and things for the purpose of legislation, the classification must be reasonable in its discrimination in the light of the objects sought to be accomplished and must not be arbitrary. The court reversed the judgment, concluding that any claim that the restriction of the law bore a reasonable relation to a public interest must rest not on conjecture but must be supported by something of substance, and that the claim of the state that the statute bore a reasonable relation to the public interest was based on conjecture.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the criminal case, a defendant was charged by the State with misdemeanor stalking under &sect; 6-2-506. In the civil case, the second lower trial court entered a protective order for the benefit of appellee, a neighbor, against appellant, a farmer, as a result of conduct that followed a unsuccessful lawsuit by the neighbor against the farmer that arose from the shooting death of the neighbor's pet dog. In both cases, the certified questions involved whether &sect; 6-5-506 was unconstitutional. The second district court also certified the question whether the protective order statutes,&nbsp;Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 7-3-506 to 7-3-511 (Supp. 1994), were unconstitutional. The court held that: (1) the criminal stalking statute,&nbsp;Wyo. Stat.

The assessed valuation actually used, however, was set by reducing the preceding year's valuation by 25 percent pursuant to 1988 Wyo. Sess. Laws ch. 73, &sect; 3. The issue in the case was the right of the taxpayer to have his real property appraised at its purchase price by the county assessor for purposes of the ad valorem tax. The county board approved the valuations, and the state board affirmed the county board. On judicial review, the district court affirmed the state board decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the district court's decision. The court held that the valuation reached by the county assessor was supported by substantial evidence and was arrived at by a lawful method of valuing real property. The county assessor appropriately applied the computer assisted mass appraisal arriving at assessed valuations in the case and was not bound to utilize the purchase price of the property in lieu of the appraisal method.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court vacated the district court's judgment.

The court then held that the directions given by the district court to the Board of Commissioners of Laramie County in calculating damages were not understood.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners sought review of an order of the District Court of Johnson County (Wyoming) affirming appellee county's resolution establishing a county road, in part across the landowners' land, based upon the doctrine of prescription. The landowners contended that the taking was illegal because it failed to comply with statutory requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A 10-mile segment of the road the county board sought to establish by prescription consisted of a narrow trail across the landowners' lands. They argued that the county failed to comply with statutory requirements, including requirements regarding a plat and accurate survey of the road, and that the county failed to establish adverse possession of the segment. The court agreed. Wyo. Stat. &sect; 24-1-101 (1993) provided that a road taken by prescription could not exceed 66 feet in width, and it limited the width of the road to the portion that was actually constructed or substantially maintained by the county and traveled and used by the public for 10 years or more. Contrary to the statute, the commissioners set the width of the segment of road over the landowners' lands at 66 feet, even though the segment was no more than a rocky, two-track trail up the mountain, and there was no evidence of the actual width of the road as used by either the landowners or the public. There was also no evidence showing continuous county maintenance or public use of the segment for 10 years. There was no compliance with the statutory requirement for a plat and survey of the road by the county surveyor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the case with direction to the district court to reverse and vacate the findings of fact and conclusions of law relating to the portion of county road running across the landowners' land. The court also directed the district court to reverse any intimation in the resolution or the findings of fact and conclusions of law that articulates a prescriptive easement in the public over that portion of the road.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the finding of the trial court that defendant's statements to police officials were voluntary was not clearly erroneous. The court concluded that the trial court's failure to properly instruct the jury violated defendant's right to a fair hearing on the issue of the voluntariness of the statements. However, defendant failed to demonstrate that a reasonable possibility existed that the verdict would have been different if the jury had been instructed that it had to disregard the confession if it determined it to be involuntary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming) convicting him of possessing cocaine with the intent to deliver. Defendant argued, inter alia, that evidence obtained from an illegal search of the car in which he was riding should have been suppressed, his constitutional rights against self-incrimination were violated, a cautionary instruction should have been given, and the prosecutor made improper comments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possessing cocaine with the intent to deliver, based on evidence of cocaine that a police officer seized from a car the officer had stopped, in which defendant was a passenger. The court rejected defendant's contention that the cocaine evidence was inadmissible at trial. The policeman had authority to make the initial traffic stop because it was his duty to enforce the motor vehicle laws, and the vehicle in which defendant was riding was clearly in violation of those laws that required the car to have a front, as well as rear, license plate. Since none of the occupants had a valid driver's license, the police officer reasonably ordered the car towed, and in those circumstances the inventory search of the car that turned up the cocaine was not unreasonable. The police officer's testimony regarding defendant's failure to respond to various questions the officer put to him did not violated defendant's right to remain silent, because defense counsel opened the door by raising the issue of defendant's cooperativeness, and there was no showing of prejudice from the testimony. The prosecutor's statements were no improper direct opinions as to defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also claimed that he was entitled to credit for time that he served in a county jail and on death row. The court affirmed the district court's order. The court held that the issue regarding the consecutive sentencing was previously considered and decided by the court and that defendant was barred by the law of the case from relitigating the issue. The court also held that defendant's argument was without merit because the district court did not abuse its discretion when it made defendant's life sentence consecutive to his two other sentences. The court further held that the issues regarding the credit for time in the county jail and on death row were not raised in defendant's motion and could not be raised for the first time on appeal.

Upon review, the court found that the state and the officer were immune from suit under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act (Act), Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 1-39-101 though 1-39-120 (1988 &amp; Cum. Supp. 1994), because training officers were not included in the definition of peace officers under Wyo. Stat.

The court concluded the fact that the legislature subsequently changed the definition was further proof they were not included in the definition at the time of the incident.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county adopted a resolution regulating the sale, control, and possession of fireworks, including some that were regulated by the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1261 to 1277. The retailer petitioned for an injunction enjoining the county from enforcing the resolution. The injunction was granted, but the district court affirmed the county's adoption of the resolution. On appeal, the court vacated the injunction as unnecessary because it found that the county had no authority to regulate the fireworks that it did. The court found that the resolution banning the possession, storage, use, and sale of all fireworks containing more than 25 one hundredths of a gram of explosives went further than the FHSA. Thus, the resolution impermissibly stopped the sale of fireworks that were legally being sold by the retailer pursuant to federal law. The court found that Wyoming Statute 35-10-205 (as amended, 1993) did not give to counties any greater authority than they already had under federal law. The county could not regulate or prohibit devices defined as not being &quot;fireworks&quot; in W.S. 35-10-201(a) (Wyoming).</SPAN></P>

The trial court credited him with time served in presentence incarceration and denied all other relief. On defendant's appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, holding that the delay between the criminal acts and the victim's report to the police did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction because there was no statute of limitations that applied to the crimes in question. The court also ruled that defendant's consecutive sentences did not violate double jeopardy provisions against multiple punishments for the same offense because each act constituted a separate crime for which he could be separately sentenced.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of knowingly taking immodest, immoral, or indecent liberties with a child. The trial court suspended defendant's prison sentence and placed him on supervised probation for eight years. Five months later, defendant's probation was revoked because he did not comply with one of the conditions of his probation when he failed to attend a sex offender treatment program. Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court abused its discretion when it revoked his probation, that it abused its discretion by ordering him to attend a sex offender treatment program, and that his sentence following the probation revocation was illegal. The court affirmed, holding that (1) defendant's refusal to sign a required treatment contract, which was a prerequisite for attending the treatment program, constituted a violation of defendant's probation; (2) the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it required defendant to attend the treatment program or when it revoked defendant's probation because he failed to attend the program; and (3) defendant's prison sentence did not exceed the maximum term of imprisonment authorized by statute and thus, the sentence was legal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs and defendants owned exclusive rights to exploit minerals on certain lands. The parties entered into an operating agreement that allocated expenses and profits for natural gas exploration and production.

The state agency ordered that the size of the drilling unit be enlarged thereby altering the parties' rights under the agreement. Plaintiffs initiated a declaratory judgment action against defendants contending that the agreement fixed the parties' working percentages despite the agency's order. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendants finding that the agreement was modified by the agency order. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. In the agreement, the parties' acknowledged that the agency had the authority to regulate the size of the drilling units. The agreement incorporated principles of state law and provided for modifications of the terms of the agreement when they were contrary to an agency order. The agency appropriately ordered a compulsory pooling of the parties' interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the publisher of a free weekly newspaper. Most of the copies of the newspaper were delivered door to door by depositing the paper on the porches of residences and buildings. In some instances, the papers came to be on the lawns, driveways or sidewalks of local residences. Defendant did not solicit subscriptions nor did he seek the consent of residents before making delivery. Defendant was convicted of violating a city litter ordinance and fined $ 210 by the municipal court. The district court upheld the conviction. The court reversed defendant's conviction and found that the application of the litter ordinance to prevent defendant from distributing his newspaper violated defendant's right to free speech. The court found that that the city failed to carry its burden of proving that application of the litter ordinance in this way was a proper time, place, and manner restriction on defendant's right to free speech. The court also found that any burden imposed upon the city in cleaning and caring for the streets as an indirect consequence of defendant's distribution of his newspaper resulted from the constitutional protection of the freedom of speech and press.</SPAN></P>

It further held that, although the proposed statute included some provisions that were unconstitutional, the fact that it was not entirely unconstitutional meant that the proposed statute could lawfully be voted on. It also rejected appellants' challenges to the initiative's title, finding that title sufficiently descriptive, and to the number of signatures listed as supporting placement of the petition on the ballot.

The court held the following: (1) the issue was whether a company that produced oil and gas was entitled to a refund of taxes when the assessed valuation had been reduced by the Wyoming State Board of Equalization; (2) when the Board adjusted the valuations for the purpose of mineral production taxes based on a taxpayer's amended reports, the valuations on which the tax was paid were erroneous; (3) the erroneous valuation was established by issuance of the special directive or notice of valuation change for purposes of the application of WYO. STAT. &sect; 39-4-101(b), and the fact the erroneous valuations were relied upon to assess and collect taxes did not demonstrate the taxes were &quot;illegal&quot; because the counties had the authority to assess and collect such taxes; (4) when adjusted valuations were adopted by the Board and special directives issued to the counties, the fact that the calculations relied upon by the counties were incorrect established that the taxes were &quot;erroneous;&quot; and (5) by the statute, the taxpayer was entitled to a refund or a credit against future taxes.</SPAN></P>

The rule was promulgated by appellee, the Wyoming Game &amp; Fish Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission promulgated a formal administrative rule that reduced the September bull elk hunting season in Teton County for the hunting season of 1992. The coalition argued on appeal that the rule was unconstitutional because (1) the Commission's authority to promulgate rules under W.S. &sect; 23-1-302 (Supp. 1992) (Wyoming) was not constrained by any identifiable legislative standards and was therefore violative of the Wyoming Constitution, and (2) the district court erred in concluding that &sect; 23-1-302 was a constitutional delegation of authority by the Wyoming Legislature. In affirming the lower court's upholding of the rule, the court held that the challenged statute,&nbsp;&sect; 23-1-302, was constitutional, and it did not manifest an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court found that the promulgation of the rule was justified by sufficiently identifiable general standards together with procedural safeguards that inhibited any unlawful, arbitrary, or capricious rulemaking by the Commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state employee challenged a decision from the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming), which granted summary judgment to appellees, state and public official, and denied her motion for partial summary judgment in her action for breach of an employment contract, for deprivation of state employment without due process of law in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and for a declaration that certain personnel rules were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state hired the employee as an auditor, but the public official terminated her because of an undisclosed, prior criminal offense. She was not entitled to an appeal because the personnel rules allowed dismissal of probationary employees for reasonable cause without right of appeal. The employee filed an action in the trial court against the state and the public official for breach of contract and a &sect; 1983 violation. The trial court granted the state and the public official summary judgment, which the court reversed as to the state and affirmed as to the public official. The personnel rules created an implied-in-fact contract of employment, and whether the employee's prior criminal offense constituted reasonable cause for dismissal was an issue of material fact. The public official was entitled to qualified immunity. A reasonable public official, at the time of the employee's termination, would not have understood that a probationary state employee subject to dismissal without right of appeal &quot;for reasonable cause&quot; had a constitutionally protected property interest. The employee's constitutional right was not clearly established by precedent at the time of her termination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions under &sect; 6-2-505(a) for making terroristic threats, raising concerns regarding vagueness and overbreadth; jurisdiction and venue; due process in identification procedures; instructions to the jury on the law of the case and lesser included crimes; witnesses comments on another's credibility; victim impact testimony; other bad acts testimony; hearsay; closing arguments; the sufficiency of the evidence. The court affirmed the convictions on appeal. Rejecting the argument that &sect; 6-2-505(a) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, the court stated that it was clear that what the legislature intended to prohibit were violent threats which subjected society to clear and present danger. Because the statute did not reach a substantial amount of protected conduct and was not a statute with no standards at all, the court's review was limited to a determination of whether it was unconstitutionally vague as it applied to defendant's conduct. As it was clear that defendant's conduct violated the statute and the record did not reflect arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After working for the state for a number of years, the employee requested a job that did not expose him to cold weather conditions because of prior severe frostbite. The job he was given required him to make outdoor cold weather deliveries because he had the least seniority. He was given the options to quit, return to the job, or take a position on the night crew. The employee asked that he be allowed to return to the job without having to make outdoor deliveries. He was terminated. After an action in federal district court was summarily dismissed, the employee filed the instant state court suit. The court held that (1) the employee conceded that his constitutional and due process claims were barred by res judicata and collateral estoppel; (2) because the employee did not follow the proper procedure by filing an appeal of the dismissal decision, he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and was barred from bringing the instant action; (3) the employee had agreed to follow the administrative procedure as a condition of his employment; and (4) primary jurisdiction had been vested in the Wyoming Department of Administration and Information.</SPAN></P>

In addition, defendant maintained his guilty pleas were not voluntary, in part, because of ineffective assistance of counsel.

The court upon a careful review of the substantive and procedural contentions of error made by defendant, held that defendant, with the assistance of competent counsel, made two voluntary pleas of guilty to sexual assault in the second degree. The court also held that the criminal justice system accorded defendant every necessary procedural safeguard to insure due process. Finally, in its affirmance, the court held that in accepting a plea bargain, defendant avoided the strong possibility of even more severe penalties for his crimes, despite the fact that his sentences exceeded those recommended in the plea bargain.

The co-employees sought certification as to the effect of the Wyoming Supreme Court's declaration that the joint employee immunity created by &sect; 27-14-104(a) was unconstitutional. The court had to determine the standard applied to cases between the July 1, 1987 effective date of the repeal of the &quot;culpable neglect&quot; language and the most recent amendment, which went into place on February 18, 1993.The court held that the declaration revived Wyo.

For claims accruing between July 1, 1987, and February 18, 1993, culpable negligence was the degree of negligence that an injured employee had to prove against a co-employee in an action to recover damages for personal injury suffered in a work-related accident.

App. P. 12.09 from the District Court of Natrona County (Wyoming) for a determination of whether the designation could be made without factors established by rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The EQC held public hearing to determine whether the disputed mountain could be classified as &quot;very rare or uncommon.&quot; The EQC designated the mountain as such, and the lessee who had mineral leases on the land challenged the designation. The court held that the designation could not be made until criteria and factors to guide such a designation were promulgated by the EQC in rule. The court held that the language of Wyo. Stat. &sect; 35-11-112(a)(v) (Supp. 1992) without such elaboration was too amorphous to permit judicial review of EQC action. Thus, any designation made without criteria and factors was inherently arbitrary and capricious.

His appeal was consolidated with a declaratory judgment action by petitioners, a business and defendant, against respondents, a county's commissioners, its sheriff, and the State of Wyoming. After an appeal and remand, the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming) affirmed the conviction and the county's authority to regulate fireworks. The issue was certified to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal question for review was whether a county resolution, when read in conjunction with the Wyoming Fireworks Act, W.S. &sect;&sect; 35-1-201 through 207, was ambiguous, inconsistent, and constitutionally vague in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and Wyoming Constitution, Article 1, &sect;&sect; 3, 6. Another question was whether a Wyoming county, under its police power, had the power to use proper means to enforce its resolution subject to judicial review. The court held that (1) to the extent that Haddenham v. Bd. of County Comm'rs (Haddenham II) and Gueke v. Bd. of County Comm'rs held that W.S. 35-10-205 (Wyoming) authorized county governments to regulate the sale of fireworks, not otherwise regulated by state law, they misstated the law; (2) the two cases ignored the distinction between counties and municipalities; (3) counties could enforce state statutes regulating fireworks but could not enact laws providing criminal penalties for such regulation; (4) an amendment to &sect; 35-10-205 provided further evidence that when the county enacted its resolution, it was not authorized to regulate the use, sale, or possession of fireworks; and (5) the county's fireworks resolution was invalid.</SPAN></P>

The district court denied defendant's preliminary motions. The district court convicted defendant. The court reversed and remanded.

Thus, the court remanded to the district court for a hearing with respect to the grant of immunity. During voir dire, a potential juror admitted he was married to a witness for the State and that they had discussed the case. By his failure to challenge the juror and acceptance of the panel at trial, defendant waived any objection to the service of this juror. In addition, defendant did not challenge any juror for cause. So, he waived any objections to the other jurors. The State filed its criminal complaint eight years after the man was killed.

Defendant alleged on appeal that the State charged and convicted him with the wrong crime, that 14-3-105 was unconstitutional, and that he was improperly sentenced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At his arraignment, defendant pleaded not guilty to each of four counts of indecent liberties with a minor. The next year, he was charged with two additional counts involving incidents with a different minor prior to the initial charges. He pleaded nolo contendere to two counts, one for each minor, pursuant to a plea agreement. On appeal, the court first noted that, because defendant pleaded nolo contendere, he could only attack a defect if it involved &quot;attributes of jurisdiction.&quot; Defendant's attack, however, was nonjurisdictional because it was an objection to the pretrial procedure and was not one that would prevent a trial. The court next found that the indecent liberties statute withstood a vagueness challenge in prior cases, and it applied to cases where adults engaged in sexual intercourse with minors. As to defendant's sentence, the court found noted that defendant's counsel never objected to the use of two psychological reports at the sentencing hearing. Also, there was no plain error shown. Because the sentencing court clearly informed defendant that it would consider the reports and because defendant consented to their use, he waived any objection to their consideration.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision by the District Court of Platte County and Converse County (Wyoming), which convicted him of taking immodest, immoral or indecent liberties with a child. At issue was whether the offense was a lesser included offense of second-degree assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court agreed that it was plain error for the trial court to permit the lesser-included offense instruction from which his conviction resulted. The instruction stated that the immodest, immoral, or indecent liberties crime was a lesser-included offense of second-degree assault. The court determined that it was not. The victim was defendant's step-daughter. Defendant allegedly tied the step-daughter's hands so that he could remove her clothes and fondle her, and he also forced her to touch his penis and put it in her mouth. The court looked to Wyoming's meaning of a lesser-included offense and found that the elements of the claimed &quot;lesser&quot; offense were not identical to part of the elements of the &quot;greater&quot; offense of sexual assault in the second degree. The assault offense, Wyo. Stat. &sect; 6-2-303(a)(v), punished conduct involving sexual intrusion (as defined in Wyo. Stat. &sect; 6-2-301(vii) (1988)) while the indecent liberties offense, Wyo. Stat. &sect; 14-3-105, punished sexual intrusion as well as other forms of conduct. Each statute was intended to suppress different evils, and the court thus found that it was error to permit the instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father challenged a decision from the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming), which determined appellant to be the father of a child born out of wedlock and entered a judgment against him. The judgment included reimbursement to appellee, the State of Wyoming, for child support paid to appellee mother, child support to be paid to the mother from the date the action was commenced to emancipation, costs and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Six years after the child was born, the mother sustained a serious injury and since then subsisted on social security disability and Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The father contended the court erred in computing child support, requiring a double recovery, and in enforcing a retroactive award. The State conceded some calculation errors. There was a mathematical error in adding the individual items in the award. Another error was that the AFDC funds expended during the pendency of the action were not properly accounted for. The court modified the judgment to correct the errors. The court then addressed the merits of the father's claim. The father was not entitled to a credit for the amount he alleged he placed in a bank account because the State had not received it. The demands made by the mother and the State were minimal in comparison to what the father should have paid over the years. Although the amount set was higher than the amount under the guidelines, Wyo. Stat. &sect; 20-6-304, the father was not entitled to relief from a court of equity. The statutory guidelines were not crafted to give any special protection or advantage to a parent owing support.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that acquisition of the phone logs did not violate Wyo. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary issue was whether Wyoming's grandparent visitation statute,&nbsp;Wyo. Stat. &sect; 20-7-101 (Supp. 1992), extended visitation rights to grandparents when the custodial parent was the grandparents' own child. The court found that it did. The child had lived with the grandparents for four years. After the father remarried and moved away, the grandparents were granted one extended visit and only supervised visits thereafter. The parents testified that they considered the grandparents fit to care for the child. On review, the court found no restriction limiting the grandparents' right to bring the action. The legislative concern was the best interests of the child. The court rejected the argument that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the grandparents had been denied reasonable visitation and in outlining the specific visitation schedule. The parents also argued that the district court ordered visitation that substantially impaired their rights as parents. While the parents could not dictate the terms of the child's visitation with the grandparents, the parents failed to show how this translated into a substantial impairment of their parental rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecutor directed a probation officer to prepare a false and perjured petition for revocation of probation against the arrestee. The prosecutor secured a bench warrant resulting in the arrestee's incarceration for 38 days without opportunity to post bail, to be arraigned, to secure the assistance of counsel, or to obtain a hearing. The arrestee and his wife filed a suit against the prosecutor for misconduct. After the court affirmed the dismissal of the suit for absolute immunity, the United States Supreme Court remanded the case. The court vacated and remanded. The prosecutor was not entitled to absolute immunity from liability. In claiming absolute immunity, he was required to meet a threshold burden of entitlement before absolute immunity would have been extended beyond the fundamental activities of the criminal prosecution. Absolute immunity did not apply to the advisement and discussion with the probation officer regarding preparation of the petition for revocation. Qualified immunity provided adequate protection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the parent's malpractice suit on behalf of his son, he argued that the trial court erred in unduly limiting jury selection. Reviewing the record for compliance with the state's rules of civil procedure, the court held that the trial court improperly failed to afford each side an additional peremptory challenge when it called two alternate jurors to sit on the panel. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the trial court's error in failing to allow the parent an additional peremptory challenge required reversal of the judgment because the decision implicated the parent's right to a fair trial. The trial court then held that, under the case law in effect at the time of the trial, the trial court did not err in affording three peremptory challenges to each physician because the physicians constituted separate &quot;sides&quot; under state law and were entitled to their own sets of challenges.

After the trial court sentenced them to consecutive terms, defendants appealed. The court vacated the sentences for the underlying felony of aggravated robbery. The court left undisturbed the remaining sentences of life imprisonment for felony murder and 20 to 25 years for conspiracy, to be served consecutively. The purpose of the robbery statute was to protect lives and punish a crime of violence. The codification of robbery as an offense against the person supported this position. A prior case erroneously determined that the robbery statute was intended to protect an interest in property. The Wyoming legislature authorized punishment for the offense of felony murder. However, multiple punishment for the underlying felony which supplied the premeditation, deliberation, and malice presumption was not authorized by the legislature. The imposition of multiple punishments for felony murder and the underlying felony violated the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Wyoming constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The probationary license was not valid for commercial motor vehicle operation. The driver petitioned the lower court for review. The lower court upheld the hearing examiner's ruling.

He appeared before a county court judge after he unsuccessfully challenged his extradition from South Dakota. The county court judge found that defendant was a serious flight risk who would not likely appear voluntarily at his trial. The county court judge ruled, consistently with this finding, that defendant be held without bond pending adjudication of his case, in accordance with the provisions of Wyo. R. Crim. P. 46.1(e). In his petition, defendant argued that his confinement pending trial violated Article 1, &sect; 14 of the Wyoming Constitution, which provided that all persons shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, except for capital offenses when the proof was evident or the presumption great. In granting the writ of habeas corpus, the court held that the provisions of Rule 46 .1 contravened Article 1, &sect; 14 of the Wyoming Constitution, and there was no justification for the county court's refusal to set bail. The court stated that the provisions of the Wyoming Constitution took precedence over the provisions of the Wyoming Rules of Criminal Procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a large Wyoming corporate taxpayer, brought a declaratory judgment action to challenge a mineral tax assessment. The District Court of Uinta County (Wyoming) granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, 23 counties and the state. The taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court found as follows: (1) The district court properly exercised discretion to yield on the point-of-valuation issue to an exhaustion of administrative remedies request by the state taxation agencies. The State Board of Equalization had initial jurisdiction, and the district court did not have to conduct a broad analysis prior to the first review by the constitutionally-established and statutorily-directed agency. The complexities of the Wyoming taxation system provided an adjudicatory challenge that would not be accepted for judicial resolution until administrative agency review and reconciliation on this broad issue was completed. (2) No statute of limitations existed for collection of unpaid severance and ad valorem taxes due upon mineral production. The court analyzed potentially applicable delinquent-tax-collection time limitations and found nothing under Wyoming law to restrict the power of the state and counties from collecting due and unpaid mineral production taxes. (3) The contract services program of the county governments to search for unpaid mineral taxes was neither illegal nor subject to judicially inflicted injunctive discontinuance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment on the exhaustion issue and remanded for entry of appropriate declaratory judgment orders in accord with its decision on the statute-of-limitations and contractor issues.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the summary judgment entered in the media corporations' favor was appropriate. In so holding, the court concluded that Wyo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Fremont County (Wyoming), which sentenced her to six months in jail for criminal contempt when she failed to surrender to begin confinement on a jail term to which she had been sentenced for a different conviction. Defendant claimed that she was not advised of her rights when she pled guilty to the contempt charge, she was deprived of a jury trial, and the trial judge was biased.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the trial court was about to sentence defendant on her forgery conviction, she requested a delay to make arrangements for her baby. Before granting the request, the trial court advised her that she would be held in contempt if she did not surrender herself when the required. She became a fugitive. When she was rearrested, she pled guilty to contempt of court, and the trial court sentenced her to six additional months in jail. The court rejected defendant's contentions that the trial court should have advised her of her due process rights before accepting her plea to the contempt charge, and that she was deprived of a jury trial on the contempt charge. The trial judge gave defendant ample notice of the consequences of a contempt conviction, and the notice requirements of Wyo. R. Cr. P. 42 (eff. March 24, 1992) did not apply retroactively to defendant's case. There was no need for the trial judge to disqualify himself because a bail jumping contempt did not invoke concerns about disrespect for or criticism of the trial judge. Defendant was not entitled to a jury trial on the contempt charge because there was no risk that she would receive a sentence in excess of six months.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, petitioners claimed that the legislation enacted to enforce the municipal alcohol nonconsumption provisions via driver's license suspension violated the both state and federal Constitutions. The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings, holding that the statutes did not bear a reasonable relationship to the interest of highway safety because vehicles were not involved in any way in the commissions of the offenses. Accordingly, the court found that the statutes were an unreasonable and arbitrary exercise of the State's police power in violation of constitutional guarantees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother lost control of her car when she rounded a turn onto an icy patch of road causing the death of her son and injury to her daughter. The father filed suit for negligence. The jury found for the mother. The father appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. Parental immunity did not bar the suit because driving was not an essential parental activity. The officer's testimony regarding the effect of the nonuse of seat belts was admissible relevant evidence, but only to the son, because it provided a causal relationship between the son's death and the nonuse of the seat belt, but failed to do so for the daughter. The risk-benefit analysis of whether the mother's failure to use seatbelts was negligent was within the providence of the jury. The jury verdict was supported by substantial evidence, therefore it was not an abuse of discretion to deny a new trial and uphold the jury verdict. The father failed to specifically object to the failure to provide the res ipsa loquitur jury instruction, and the plain error rule was not available because other conditions other than negligence were credible causes of the accident.</SPAN></P>

Following a hearing before a district court commissioner, the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming) entered a judgment requiring appellant father to pay an increased amount of child support until the parties' minor child was 21 years of age and to pay medical expenses not covered by insurance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court increased the amount of the father's monthly child support payments pursuant to the child support guidelines based on the fact that the father's income had substantially increased since the time the divorce decree was entered. On appeal of the judgment, the court determined that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-6-306(a) (Michie Supp. 1990), upon which the district court relied to modify the support obligation, did not violate the separation of powers provision found in Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1 because the district court retained discretion to deviate from the child support guidelines when determining whether a modification of a support order was proper. The court also ruled that the judgment did not impair the father's obligation under the parties' property settlement agreement in violation of the contract clause found in Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect; 35 because the agreement merged into the divorce decree and lost its contractual nature. The court further ruled that the district court had no continuing jurisdiction to modify the decree by requiring payments to be made past the child's age of majority unless the child was physically or mentally prevented from becoming emancipated.</SPAN></P>

The employees brought suit against the co-employees, but the district court granted a summary judgment in the co-employees' favor. The court affirmed on appeal. On the employees' motion for rehearing, the court found that &sect; 27-14-104(a) was unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection guarantees of the Wyoming constitution. The court held that the legislation's classifications infringed on the employees' fundamental right to access to the courts pursuant to Wyo. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, because the statute granted complete immunity from lawsuits by co-employees acting in the scope of their employment. Upon application of the strict scrutiny test, the court held that Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27-14-104(a) was not supported by a compelling state interest because it burdened the state's interest in prohibiting an individual from committing an intentional tort without the possibility of liability.

Defendant argued that a person could be guilty of reckless endangerment only if he actually put the victim in danger and asserted that he did not put anyone in danger. Defendant also complained of his probation terms. The adjudication of delinquency was affirmed. The probation terms were also affirmed except defendant was not required to reimburse the public defender. The court held that (1) &sect;6-2-504(b) meant that whenever a person knowingly pointed a loaded or unloaded firearm at another, he was guilty of reckless endangering, provided that the firearm was not pointed for defensive purposes, (2) it was within the trial court's discretion to allow a probation officer to search a juvenile, which included taking a urine sample to test for alcohol without reasonably suspecting that a probation violation existed, and (3) the trial court had the right under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-6-229(f)(v) (Supp. 1991) to revoke defendant's license.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's prior convictions for kidnapping, which was the object of the conspiracy, and sexual assault were reversed for speedy trial violations. Defendant asserted violation of his double jeopardy and speedy trial rights, pretrial publicity issues, and error in the use of his allocution testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant grabbed a woman and pulled her into a truck, where his co-defendant sexually assaulted her. At the sentencing portion of the first trial, which resulted in the convictions that were later reversed, defendant gave an allocution statement in which he admitted participating in the offense. The court affirmed the conviction. The court rejected defendant's argument that the second prosecution violated his rights against double jeopardy. The court found that the evidence used to establish the conspiracy, the overt acts leading up to the offense, were not acts that constituted elements of the crimes of first degree sexual assault or kidnapping. The court held that there was no speedy trial violation from the filing of the complaint to the date of trial. The court held that the denial of defendant's motion to change venue due to pretrial publicity was proper when over half the potential jurors stated that they had formed no opinion about defendant's guilt. Finally, the court held that the use of the allocution testimony given at the first trial in the second prosecution was constitutional because defendant gave that testimony voluntarily.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed his conviction and life sentence.

The court concluded that defendant was not entitled to the instruction because he was not charged with that crime, and it was not a theory of defense to the charge of murder. The court found that the charge of felony murder was supported because there was sufficient evidence presented by which the jury could have found that the killing and the robbery were part and parcel of one transaction. The court set up a three-part framework by which to determine whether there was premeditation.

On appeal, defendant argued that the county court's denial of his request for a continuance to retain counsel of his choice violated his U.S. Const. amend.

He also argued that the request for a continuance four days before the date set for the preliminary hearing did not constitute a waiver of the right to have counsel represent him at the preliminary hearing. The state argued, however, that defendant waived any irregularities in the conduct of the preliminary hearing when he entered a plea of nolo contendere, which was accepted by the district court. The court found that this case was resolved by the state's argument that defendant's nolo contendere plea waived all non-jurisdictional defenses, including his claim that he was denied counsel at the preliminary hearing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action was certified from the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming). Appellant taxpayer sought a refund of sales taxes from appellee, the Wyoming State Board of Equalization. The question was whether an amendment to the statute that provided for the filing of claims for refunds, which reduced the time for filing from three years to one, would bar a claim that had been accrued for less than three years, but more than one year.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer contested a determination by the Board that a 1989 amendment to Wyo. Stat. &sect; 39-6-410(c) (1988), reducing the period for filing a sales tax refund claim from three years to one, could be applied so as to bar its refund claim that had accrued before the effective date of the amendment. The Board's position was that a taxpayer had no vested right to claim a refund because any refund of taxes was solely an act of legislative grace that could be extinguished at any time. The court found that, however sound the rule was that credit or refund statutes could be repealed without concern for vested rights, the court found that the case did not involve a repeal of the right. Rather, the case involved an amendment to the statute that reduced the period within which refund claims could be presented, which was very different. As a general rule, tax statutes would be construed to operate prospectively only if there was a doubt as to whether the statute was intended to have retroactive application. The court found it doubtful that the amendment was intended to apply retrospectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the Board's decision and remanded the action to the Board for additional proceedings consistent with the opinion of the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued in part that the district court erroneously denied the mother's motion to dismiss for improper service of process. On appeal, the court considered the issue of proper service of process to obtain jurisdiction over a non-resident mother. The court reversed the district court order because it found no proper service to jurisdictionally sustain entry of the order of termination of the parent-child relationship under the Wyoming statutes. The court ruled that jurisdiction was lacking because of insufficient service of process, and therefore the order was void. In so ruling, the court determined that the approach taken by the department of family services (DFSS) did not comply with any of the acceptable methods of service of process under Wyo. R. Civ. P. 4. The court observed that DFSS attempted to serve process with a certified mailing but that it failed to preliminarily file the requisite affidavit as detailed in Rule 4(f), and it failed to comply with the necessity for clerk mailing and certificate of filing the return receipt.</SPAN></P>

The railroad claimed that its heavy equipment was not used primarily in construction and maintenance of roads, bridges, ditches, buildings, or land reclamation, which was required by &sect;&sect; 31-2-603 to 605, W.S. 1977 (Wyoming, June 1989).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant administratrix challenged a judgment of the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming), which ruled in favor of appellee state treasurer in a declaratory judgment action. She claimed that the treasurer did not have a lien under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27-12-104 (June 1983 Repl.) on her third party wrongful death recovery or a right to reimbursement for worker's compensation benefits that were paid to the decedent's survivor beneficiaries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administratrix secured a third party recovery for her decedent's wrongful death and the treasurer requested reimbursement for worker's compensation benefits paid for his injuries and death. The administratrix sought a declaratory judgment that there was no right to reimbursement. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for the treasurer, rejecting the administratrix's claim that &sect; 27-12-104 did not apply. The court construed &sect; 27-12-104 and the Wrongful Death Act (Act) together and ruled that the Act did not bar the reimbursement claim and lien established by &sect; 27-12-104. Neither a decedent nor his estate was required to repay worker's compensation benefits. The benefits were thus not an estate debt and the treasurer's recovery was not barred by Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 1-38-102, which shielded judgment proceeds from estate debts when there were survivor beneficiaries. Further, the language of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27-12-104(c), (d) showed a legislative intent to include the death benefit in the reimbursement and lien provisions. In addition, although the treasurer did not file a claim against the estate, &sect; 2-7-703 did not bar recovery for moneys that were not a debt of the estate.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court agreed with the lower court that the city possessed immunity from the claim under the Wyoming Governmental Claims Act. The court disagreed with the appellant that the case fell within an exception to governmental immunity.

The mother sought review of the judgment of the District Court of Fremont County, Wyoming, which granted the school district's motion to dismiss and which dismissed the mother's complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor injured her knees while running a two-mile race as a member of a high school track team. The mother claimed that the school district was liable for the minor's injuries because she told a track coach that the minor should not run in the race. The mother also claimed that the trial court erred in finding that her failure to timely file her claim within the two-year period under W.S. &sect; 1-39-113 (June 1988 Repl.) (Wyoming) barred her cause of action. The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that an action under W.S. &sect; 21-3-129 (1977) (Wyoming) required the filing of a proper notice of claim with the two-year limitation period under W.S. &sect; 1-39-113 (June 1988 Repl.) (Wyoming). The court also held that the mother failed to timely file the notice on the minor's behalf and that the minor was not capable of giving the notice. The court held, however, that the time for filing the notice on behalf of the minor did not begin to run until a guardian ad litem was appointed for the minor.

Ann. &sect; 6-4-101(a) (1977) and armed robbery in violation of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-4-402 (1977). The jury recommended capital punishment, which was imposed by the District Court of Converse County (Wyoming), pursuant to Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-102(f) (1977). An order was later entered that dismissed the prisoner's petition for post-conviction relief, and the prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner alleged that the failure of the State to disclose the hypnosis of a key witness was error that required reversal of the conviction. The court disagreed and held that, while the State did err in not disclosing the information, the prisoner did not demonstrate substantial prejudice. The prisoner further alleged that he was denied ineffective assistance of counsel. The court again did not agree and held that there was no prejudicial error relating to the prisoner's ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The court determined that the trial court did not err in not allowing the prisoner's expert witness to testify. The prisoner's wife was allowed to assert the spousal immunity privilege and refuse to testify, and there was no conflict of interest. The court determined, however, that the prisoner's sentence of capital punishment had to be vacated because the sentence was enhanced by the underlying felony, a robbery, and the underlying robbery as a result was used three times to convict and then enhance the seriousness of the sentence. The court determined that the classification of the felony murder defendant was an arbitrary and capricious classification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The essential question in the case was whether an individual who had been released on parole from the Wyoming State Penitentiary was entitled to be admitted to bail after his apprehension and detention as a parole violator. The court held that there was no right to bail for a parole violator. It stated that the record of the instant inmate's parole violations persuaded it that the inmate should not be admitted to bail. The court stated that the inmate's parole violations seemed to manifest an accelerating diminution of his capacity to control his behavior and to avoid violations of his parole. The court concluded that it need not decide what the appropriate rule would be if another court should set bail for a parole violator. It stated that it held only that the inmate had no right to be admitted to bail and, consequently, that he was not unlawfully detained by the warden.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father petitioned to determine the nonexistence of the father and child relationship, alleging that his son and daughter were not his natural children. The district court denied his requests for an appointment of a guardian ad litem for the children, an informal hearing, and an order to conduct genetic testing to determine parentage. The district court granted the mother's motion to dismiss, and the father appealed. The Supreme Court affirmed, and held the father's petition was barred by the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel and judicial estoppel, and because it was not brought within a reasonable time pursuant to Wyo. Stat. Ann &sect; 14-2-104(a)(ii). Paternity was adjudicated in the parties' divorce action; thus, the matter was res judicata. Because the father asserted in the divorce decree that both children were &quot;of the marriage,&quot; he was estopped from claiming that neither child was his. Although he brought his petition within five years of the birth of both children, the balance between the children's protected right not to be &quot;bastardized&quot; outweighed the father's interest in ascertaining paternity two years after the divorce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation prepared an advertising brochure and distributed copies to solicit clients.

The Board issued an order for the corporation to cease distribution of the advertising material and the corporation requested a hearing. The issue on review was whether W.S. 33-11-114 (1977) violated the United States and Wyoming Constitutions by its prohibition of advertisement of a collection agency's ability to provide legal services. The court affirmed the order of the Board and held that pursuant to W.S. 33-11-114 (1977), the corporation could not advertise that it provided legal services. An attempt to inform potential clients of legal services had no constitutional protection because there was no constitutional right to advertise a willingness to engage in illegal activity. Also, if the contested advertisement was an attempt to inform potential clients of the services authorized by W.S. 33-11-114, it was misleading and was not entitled to constitutional protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department, upon review of the hearing record and its interpretation of Wyoming S. 31-7-128, determined that the offense and conviction of the second DWUI occurred within five years of the first DWUI conviction. The driver's license was suspended for one year - the penalty for a second DWUI conviction within a five year period. The court found the Department's action of suspension in this case was not arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion. Wyoming Statute 31-7-128 did not allow for an exercise of discretion. Agency action was mandated. The driver was convicted of DWUI on December 19, 1984. He was convicted again for DWUI on September 11, 1989. This was more than substantial evidence; it was unrefuted evidence of a second conviction within the specified five-year period. While the Department could use either the date of occurrence or date of conviction of a second DWUI to determine if the second DWUI occurred within five years of a previous DWUI, the driver had the opportunity to challenge both of his arrests for DWUI, but he pled guilty to both of them. Neither of the convictions was appealed. Therefore, Wyoming S. 31-7-128 is not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district sued the architect for damages on a school building construction project over 10 years after the project was completed.

The school district appealed claiming that as a sovereign activity it was not subject to the statute of limitations. The court held that construction of a public school building by the school district was a sovereign activity and that a suit against a contractor, or more specifically against the architect, for damages arising out of that construction was brought to vindicate public rights, thus the applicable statutes of limitations could not be invoked to bar the school district from bringing its action to protect the public rights; therefore, the order of the trial court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a wrongful death suit filed by petitioner against respondents, the District Court of Carbon County (Wyoming) reserved constitutional questions for the court. The question raised was whether Wyo. Const. art. 10, &sect; 4, foreclosed the extension of immunity to a co-employee pursuant to &sect; 27-14-104(a), W.S. 1977 (June 1987 Repl.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner's position was that the extension of immunity to a co-employee eliminated a cause of action in favor of an injured worker and that such a limitation was impermissible because it constituted a limitation on the damages recoverable for injury or death. Petitioner's decedent worked for a construction company. Respondents were co-employees. The company was engaged in hauling waste materials. When a truck driven by respondent one was approximately one and a half miles away from an oncoming truck driven by the decedent, respondent one pulled into the driving lane occupied by the decedent's truck. A collision ensued in which the decedent was killed. Petitioner later filed a wrongful death action against respondents and the company owner, who was dismissed because he had worker's compensation coverage in effect. In declining to answer the constitutional question, the court found that Rule 52(c), W.R.C.P., had not been satisfied in that an issue of fact existed as to whether respondents were acting within the scope of their employment. The court would not answer the constitutional question where the trial court had not disposed of controlling questions of fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant workers sought review of the judgment of the district court of Fremont County (Wyoming), which held that Wyo. Stat. &sect; 27-14-104(a)(1977 &amp; Cum. Supp. 1989), the provision of Wyoming's worker's compensation statute that extended the immunity granted to employers to co-employees acting within the scope of their employment, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Injured workers brought suits against appellee co-employees, who successfully moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Wyo. Stat. &sect; 27-14-104(a) (1977) was constitutional and immunized them from suit. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the legislature had the authority to eliminate any and all causes of action accruing against an injured worker's co-employee because Wyo. Const. art 10, &sect; 4 did not impose any restraints on the legislature's authority to restrict causes of action available against co-employees; it only restricted limitations on damages. Moreover, the court did not agree that the statute lacked a quid pro quo between the employer and employee, and even if it did, the purported absence of a quid pro quo in the statute did not violate substantive or procedural due process, nor did it deny access to the court or the right to a trial by jury, in violation of Wyo. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 8 and 9, because the absence of a right to recover did not equate to a denial of access to the court. Finally, the court held that the statute did not violate equal protection because all employees could be covered under the statute, not just those in extrahazardous employments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment that the legislature had the constitutional authority to eliminate all causes of action against an injured worker's co-employee when the co-employee caused an injury while acting within the scope of his employment for an employer covered in the act, and affirmed the lower court's grant of summary judgment to the co-employees.</SPAN></P>

R. Civ. P. 60(b) and a motion to stay judgment pending reconsideration and/or motion to vacate. The district court never entered a ruling on the Wyo. R. Civ. P. 60(b) motion and it was deemed denied pursuant to Wyo. R. Civ. P. 59. The client appealed. The court reversed and held that it was error to have: (1) an undocumented continuance without a specific future date stated for hearing; (2) a decision entered before a stated 10 days had expired; and (3) no compliance with the three day notice provision required to obtain a default judgment.

The attorney won an award for her client and submitted attorney fees, which were reduced by the administrative hearing offer.

The officer also denied copy machine charges and mail costs pursuant to policy. The attorney petitioned to the district court, which restored the fees and costs, and the court affirmed on appeal. The court held that the hearing officer's action was contrary to law because the decision did not comport with the agency's rule, but had become an office policy that arose from the rule that legal costs, as opposed to attorney fees, could not have exceeded $ 1000 without approval. Because the attorney's rate was below the area's custom and standard, the case was difficult, the work necessary, and the results were favorable, the reduction was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor was in the custody of the division after the death of his mother. The father had given up on trying to enforce visitation with the minor after effort of the mother and her family to keep him away from his son but his parental rights were never terminated. The mother died and the minor was in the custody of foster parents. The father resurfaced after the mother died. After an investigation, custody of the minor was restored to the father and an action was filed thereafter. The court found that summary judgment upon the &sect; 1983 claim was proper as it had been determined that the state and its officials in their official capacities were not &quot;person&quot; under &sect; 1983. The trial court found that the minor's negligence claims were time-barred. W.S. 1-39-113(a) (Wyoming) provided for claim presentation within two years of discovery. The court found this time period should be tolled to protect minors from the harsh result of strict application of notice of claim requirements. As the minor was in the custody of the division, the claim requirement could not be affected to the minor's detriment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment following his convictions for aggravated burglary and interference with a peace officer. He successfully challenged the aggravated burglary conviction and the life sentence imposed for that offense. His convictions with respect to the lesser-included offense of simple burglary and with respect to the charge of interference with a peace officer were upheld. A remand was directed solely for resentencing on the burglary charge. The sentences were then made to run consecutively, not concurrently. The court reversed on appeal. The court held that (1) double jeopardy did not bar a complete resentencing if the entire package had been remanded, which it had not; (2) double jeopardy would bar an enhancement made after one of the sentences was final and not appealed; but (3) double jeopardy did not bar the change made by the trial court at resentencing. Nonetheless, the court concluded that the change was made without any explanation, creating an improper enhancement without any change in circumstances. Such a resentencing could not stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1988, the Wyoming Medical Review Panel Act, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9-2-1501 to -1511 (1977), was declared unconstitutional because it violated the equal protection provisions of the Wyoming Constitution. Thereafter, the legislature enacted the Wyoming Professional Review Panel Act, Wyo. Stat.

The Act mandated that the panel have a director appointed by the governor. The governor, however, never appointed a director. The associations sought the issuance of a writ of mandamus compelling the governor to appoint a director to execute and implement the Act. The court denied the petition, holding the Act unconstitutional. The court found that the Act was almost identical to the Wyoming Medical Review Panel Act, except that it applied to all professionals and not just to health care providers. The court said that this expansion of the class to which the Act applied did not cure the earlier identified constitutional defects, i.e., that the legislation was not rationally related to the state's goal of protecting public health or economic and social stability.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the prosecutor's refusal to consent to first offender treatment for her violated her due process rights. The court rejected that contention because as defendant made no individual argument, and as the court had decided in the second case that &sect;7-13-301 did not operate in such a way as to offend defendants' constitutional rights, defendant's due process rights were not at all offended by &sect;7-13-301. The court had also held in the second case that the prosecutor's control of a prosecution was committed to his sound discretion and that the court would not interfere with the exercise of that discretion unless it was based on suspect factors or arbitrary classification.

III, &sect; 20, which proscribed altering or amending a bill during its passage through the legislature so as to change the bill's original purpose; (3) the statute was enacted in violation of Wyo. Const. art. 3, &sect; 24, which mandated the passage of a bill containing only one subject which must be clearly expressed in the bill's title; and (4) the State's refusal was arbitrary and an abuse of discretion in violation of Wyo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 2 and 7. Because defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute, the court decided to review the case even though the issue was not brought up at the trial court. Section 7-13-301 was constitutional. The State's action was neither arbitrary nor an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, defendants sought review of judgments from the District Courts of Laramie and Natrona Counties (Wyoming), which convicted them of various crimes for which the State refused to consent to the probation established by Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-13-301. The State sought review of a judgment of the County Court of Campbell County (Wyoming), which found that the State's consent requirement of &sect; 7-13-301 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 7-13-301, if both the defendant and the State consented, the court could defer further prosecution and place the defendant on probation without entry of a judgment of guilt or conviction. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 7-13-301 did not violate the separation of powers doctrine, and was a constitutional recognition of the executive department's power to initiate, control, and terminate criminal prosecutions before the judicial department exercised its power to enter a final judgment. The court focused upon the meaning of judgment of conviction under Wyo. R. Crim. P. 33(b), that until the judicial department entered a judgment of guilt or conviction, the State possessed the executive department's power to control and terminate the prosecution at any time before final judgment. Thus, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7-13-301 was compatible with Wyo. R. Crim. P. 33(b) and 45(a) and was solidly based on a proper understanding of and appreciation for the common law power of the prosecutor to control the criminal case, even through verdict, until the court entered a final judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute did not violate the separation of powers doctrine and was constitutionally enacted. The State's refusal to consent to probation without entry of judgment against defendants was not an abuse of discretion and was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

Benefits were to be paid until the grandchildren reached the age of majority, excluding one year. The Wyoming Administrative Procedure Act, Wyo. Stat. &sect; 27-14-602(b) (1977), controlled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hearing officer concluded that he had jurisdiction to award benefits, that the grandchildren were entitled to benefits, that no statute of limitations applied, and that the Workers' Compensation Division was estopped from denying benefits because it gave erroneous information. The court agreed. The deputy clerk's testimony was an admission by a party-opponent under W.R.E. 801(d)(2)(D), not hearsay. The State did not show that the testimony was irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious under Wyo. Stat. &sect; 16-3-108 (1977). The deputy clerk's testimony was relevant because it was the basis for the estoppel claim. The State knew that the employee would try to prove his reliance on erroneous information provided by the Workers' Compensation Division through the deputy clerk. The State had an opportunity to cross-examine the deputy clerk. It did not seek a continuance, and it did not call a rebuttal witness. The award order did not have a preclusive effect because it did not address whether the grandchildren were entitled to benefits. The hearing officer did not abuse his discretion when he admitted evidence showing that the grandchildren were the employee's dependents.</SPAN></P>

The division contested the grant of benefits on the grounds that the statute of limitations for filing a claim, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27-14-503 (1986), had expired by the time that paternity was established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant sought workers' compensation benefits after his father was killed in a work related accident. The hearing examiner granted summary judgment to the claimant. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case, holding that the hearing examiner erred in granting summary judgment because the pleadings did not establish that either litigant was entitled to relief as a matter of law. The court also held that the statute of limitations on workers' compensation claims, contained in &sect; 27-14-503, did not bar the claimant from seeking benefits. The court explained that the statute had been tolled, pursuant to &sect; 27-14-505, because the claimant was a minor on the date that paternity was established, which was the date when his right to benefits accrued. The court based its construction of &sect; 27-14-505 on the constitutional rights illegitimate children had to be protected from discrimination on the basis of their status as illegitimate children, and the rights they had to have a fair opportunity to assert their rights to support. The court also held that a prospective child was a dependent of the putative father if in fact the child, when born, was actually his child.</SPAN></P>

The board's answer had admitted the allegation in the sheriff's complaint that he had received the housing allowance as part of his salary. The sheriff's motion for summary judgment had included an affidavit and a pay stub reflecting the housing payment.

His conviction was affirmed, and the district court denied his motion for post-conviction relief. He filed a petition for certiorari, contending that his counsel was ineffective on appeal. Petitioner argued that his counsel failed to timely file a motion to present evidence of the victim's prior sexual conduct, and did not exercise due diligence in obtaining evidence of her alleged prostitution. The same counsel defended petitioner at trial and in the original appeal. Though incompetence at trial was not raised on appeal, the court granted petitioner's writ and heard his case on the merits. The court concluded that the district court properly denied the request for a new trial. Though counsel's motion was untimely, because the district court denied the motion due to the remoteness in time of the conduct, a timely motion would have been similarly denied. Thus, petitioner could not show an adverse effect on a substantial right and no reasonable probability existed that the result would have been different had the motion been filed on time.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motions for a psychiatric examination of the victims, to compel production of summaries of expert witness testimony, and his motion to dismiss on the basis of the government's failure to preserve evidence. The court rejected the defendant's contentions, finding that defendant was not entitled to compel psychological examination of the victims because it was improper to allow an expert witness to comment on the credibility of witnesses. The court noted that determination of witness credibility was the sole province of the jury. The court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to obtain summaries of expert testimony because defendant did not show that the denial rendered his trial unfair. The court held that due process was satisfied concerning the lack of recordings of police interviews with the victims because defendant had access to the interviewer's notes and had an opportunity to cross-examine the interview and the victims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to compel production of psychiatric records, reports of child abuse, school records, and juvenile court transcripts because defendant did not show the records existed or that the records contained evidence that was material to the defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty after a jury trial in which he was represented by private counsel. Defendant then filed an affidavit seeking a court-appointed attorney. The affidavit stated that defendant was unemployed, in debt, and without any means to afford counsel. The trial court appointed defendant a public defender. At defendant's sentencing, the public defender stated that defendant was employed and earned more per hour than the public defender. The trial court orally gave defendant a suspended sentence and probation and ordered him to repay the cost of the public defender and contribute to the victim compensation fund. The written judgment reflected that oral sentence plus a provision to repay the prosecution costs to the State. Defendant sought review of his sentence. The court determined that although it could not address the constitutionality of W.S. 7-6-106(d) because defendant did not raise the issue at trial, the sentence was erroneous because there was no express finding of defendant's ability to pay. Also, there was no evidence establishing the prosecution costs, and the trial court did not include such repayment in its oral sentence.</SPAN></P>

However, appellee probation department made a mistake and recorded the probationer as moving to a different town than the one he was actually in. The probation department eventually discovered the mistake. However, appellee prosecutor still drafted a petition to revoke probation and a warrant was issued for the probationer's arrest. The probationer was later taken into custody. Probationer remained in jail for a month, and was eventually released after the district court denied the motion to revoke probation. Probationer then filed a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action against the probation department and the prosecutor. The district court dismissed the action against the prosecutor, ruling that the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity. On review, the court found that absolute immunity should not focus on the actual conduct involved. The court then concluded that a probation revocation hearing was intimately associated with the criminal process, and that therefore prosecutors enjoyed absolute immunity in the probation revocation process.

Downstream residents lodged complaints with the city and indicated that the residents would not support an improvement district. Negotiations between the city and the developer were ineffective, and the city restricted development. The developer did not file the instant action against the city until nearly 16 months after the city permitted construction to resume. The trial court entered judgment for the city, and the developer appealed. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that there was nothing objectionable about the city's reasonable use of a moratorium to enforce regulations designed to promote the public welfare. The developer failed to comply with drainage regulations and thereby jeopardized public safety; therefore, the city's use of its police power to enforce the regulations was not a regulatory taking for which compensation was due.</SPAN></P>

The board properly concluded that it was a use of the property in the manner for which it was designed, constructed, or intended that constituted a &quot;first use.&quot; When making the determination as to whether the first use of the property occurred in Wyoming or another state, the state tax commission looked to the nature of the property, its intended use, and whether the property was actually used in that manner in the other state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate, represented by counsel, filed a motion for post-conviction relief. The court affirmed the order denying the motion, holding that the inmate's nolo contendere plea was knowing and voluntary plea, the effect of which was to waive all defenses to the charge other than a claim that the court lacked jurisdiction. The court determined that the record presented no suggestion of any facts that would support a conclusion that the trial court was without jurisdiction, and the record did not disclose any failure of counsel. The court determined that none of the issues raised in the inmate's motion that related to matters prior to his plea raised any jurisdictional defects; thus, they were waived. The issues raised that related to the inmate's sentence did not lead to a viable claim for relief in post-conviction proceedings, and the inmate did not demonstrate good cause for his failure to raise the issues on direct appeal or prejudice as a result. Because any possible claims for post-conviction relief were foreclosed as a matter of law, the inmate's claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in the post-conviction proceeding had no merit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order by the District Court of Fremont County (Wyoming), which convicted defendant of aggravated assault and battery. On appeal, defendant presented numerous contentions of error relating to the conduct of the prosecutor and the jury, the introduction of certain evidence, the assessment of various costs upon him as part of his sentence, the propriety of a jury instruction, and the failure to grant a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the conclusion of defendant's trial, the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of aggravated assault and battery. Defendant was sentenced to serve time in the penitentiary and ordered to pay money to the crime victims compensation fund, to make restitution to the victim, to repay the State for the services of the public defender, and to repay the county for the costs of prosecution. Defendant filed a motion for a new trial premised upon several grounds, including newly discovered evidence. The motion was denied, and the denial of that motion with respect to newly discovered evidence was urged as error upon appeal. The court found that the admissibility of the &quot;new&quot; evidence was at least questionable, and the decision to exclude or admit this evidence fell within the exercise of the trial court's discretion. The court concluded that the prosecutor's conduct in cross-examination, while improper, did not deny defendant a fair trial. However, the court found that the trial court erred in ordering defendant to reimburse the State without first determining defendant's ability to pay. Otherwise, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court in all respects.</SPAN></P>

The grievance committee issued a report that included findings with regard to the attorney's actions, and a recommendation that the attorney be disbarred. Petitioner the attorney general filed an application before the court seeking acceptance of the report, findings, and recommendation. The attorney objected raising several points of error. As an initial matter, the court found that the attorney's jurisdictional argument was irrelevant, as the disciplinary authority emanated from the court itself. On the merits, the court held that some of the charges of professional misconduct were not supported by clear and convincing evidence. However, the remaining charges of professional misconduct were supported either by clear and convincing evidence or the admissions of the attorney, and these charges justified the sanction of disbarment recommended by the grievance committee. The attorney, therefore, was disbarred.</SPAN></P>

The police detained the individual until they were able to match some of his money with photocopies of bills provided for earlier methamphetamine purchases. He was then arrested and charged with conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance. In the pending criminal action, the district court granted the individual's motion to suppress the money as evidence. In the instant case, the court noted that the prosecuting attorney whose office handled the individual's criminal prosecution was also appointed as special assistant attorney general to conduct the forfeiture proceedings and held that there was sufficient identity of interest between those agents of the state to warrant the application of collateral estoppel. The state had a full opportunity to litigate the issues determined by the suppression order. The state did not carry its burden of proof that the &quot;board or commissioner&quot; under Wyo. Stat.

The trial court held a hearing on appellees' summary judgment motion, and reviewed social studies prepared pursuant to Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-2-314 (1977). The trial court terminated the father's parental rights, in accordance with Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-2-309(a)(iv), and approved the adoption. On appeal, the court found that, given the father's felony convictions and his criminal history, appellees showed by clear and convincing evidence, as required by Wyo. Stat.

The court found the father did not carry his burden, under Wyo. R. Civ. P. 56, to show that there was a genuine issue for trial. Because the termination was proper, the court held that, under Wyo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had assisted an elderly neighbor by cashing her Social Security checks and running errands for her. However, the neighbor informed defendant that she could only give him $ 50 from her sales tax refund check and that she did not want him to cash it for her. Defendant cashed the check anyway and kept the entire amount. He later returned a portion of it to the police. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction but vacated the requirement that defendant reimburse the costs of his court-appointed counsel. The court determined that defendant's specific intent to defraud, which was one of the elements of forgery, was properly proven by circumstantial evidence. Although defendant alleged that the neighbor ratified his forgery by accepting a partial payment, the court held that Wyo. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of kidnapping and first-degree sexual assault. Defendant appealed his convictions, alleging that his trial violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial. The court applied the Barker balancing test to determine if defendant's speedy trial rights were violated. The court determined that the delay of over a year and a half was excessive and presumptively prejudicial, and weighed heavily in favor of defendant in the balancing test analysis. The court also concluded that none of the delay could have been attributed to defendant. The court held that, under the circumstances of the case, a delay of over one and one-half years between the filing of the criminal complaint and the subsequent trial violated defendant's constitutionally guaranteed right to a speedy trial. The court also held that the remedy for a violation of the right to a speedy trial was reversal and dismissal of the information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the District Court of Fremont County (Wyoming) his convictions for escape from official detention, Wyo. Stat. &sect; 6-5-206(a)(i), attempted escape, and aggravated assault. At issue were rights to a speedy trial: time from arrest to date of trial (delay in prosecution); time from filing of information to date of trial (delay in district court trial); and delay in sentence after entry of a guilty plea (delay in sentencing).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On April 6, 1987, defendant took a &quot;midnight furlough&quot; from an honor farm. On September 2, 1987, he entered a plea of nolo contendere. He was sentenced on April 25, 1988. On September 4, 1987, he attempted to escape from a county jail. A criminal complaint was completed September 28, 1987, and defendant was served on October 21, 1987. He waived a preliminary hearing on December 15, 1987, an arraignment scheduled for January 13, 1988, was delayed by weather and was completed on January 20, 1988. Trial was scheduled for March 21, 1988, and then continued by the district court to be held on April 26, 1988, because of a scheduling conflict for the prosecuting attorney. The court held that: an undue delay in sentencing on the escape from the honor farm was not demonstrated; the time between the second escape and the date of actual arrest was not countable on any Sixth Amendment speedy trial inquiry and no equal protection or due process impedance was demonstrated; the time from arrest to trial was not sufficiently extended to create the presumption of delay; and the schedule followed was fairly and completely within the time limitations of Wyo.

He filed a petition for post-conviction relief in which he urged that the amendments to the habitual criminal sentencing statutes, which became effective while his case was on appeal to the court, mandated a conclusion that he was sentenced illegally. The state filed a memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss defendant's petition, arguing that defendant was contesting only the legality of sentence and, for that reason, no relief could be afforded under the post-conviction statutes. The trial court agreed with the state and dismissed defendant's petition. He sought review. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the essential issue raised by defendant related only to the legality of his sentence and did not extend to any attack upon the legality of his conviction. The court held that the post-conviction relief statute could be invoked only for the purpose of asserting errors that resulted in the conviction of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school district was advised by the Board that its contractors who supplied materials and who had also contracted to install those materials were liable for sales or use taxes pursuant to Wyo.

The school district argued that it bore the ultimate economic burden of a tax upon its contractors and alleging that such a burden was inconsistent with its constitutional and statutory status as a tax exempt political subdivision of the state. The trial court held that the constitution and statutes only prohibited the imposition of a legal liability upon governmental entities for the direct payment of a tax, not upon third parties who might pass on the economic burden of the tax. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, ruling that the legislature clearly intended that no exemption was applicable to contractors who supplied both labor and materials to exempt political subdivisions. The legislature had the power to place an indirect tax burden upon such governmental entities. The court held that the actions of the Board were consistent with legislative intent and the Wyoming Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contention that there was no substantial evidence that he and an indicted coconspirator had agreed and that, absent a meeting of the minds, there was no conspiracy. A mere tacit understanding between the coconspirators was enough to establish a conspiracy, evidence from unindicted joint venturers was not precluded from consideration, and circumstantial evidence could be used to prove the conspiracy because of the crime's covert nature. The court also found that the facts that other participants were not charged and that other conspiracies may have occurred were immaterial to the issue of which incident related to the charged conspiracy because the totality of the circumstances showed that the coconspirators' information was in furtherance of the conspiracy to commit the crime in question.

Defendant was charged with sexual assault in the first degree, burglary, sexual intrusion through physical force, and armed robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced after he pleaded guilty to three of the charges against him. He appealed, arguing that the district court denied him procedural due process when it allowed the prosecution to declare him an adult in a criminal procedure. The court noted that defendant's argument seemed to challenge statutory validity on a procedural and not a constitutional basis. Citing Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14-6-203 and Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14-6-237(b), 14-6-237(g), the court found there was no ambiguity in legislative intent and that jurisdictional criteria were: (a) exclusive jurisdiction if under the age of 13; (b) initial jurisdiction with right to transfer to adult court if between the age of 13 and under 17; and (c) joint jurisdiction if 17 or older with initial discretion vested in the prosecutor to charge and with the right of the juvenile to then request transfer to juvenile court if initially charged as an adult. The court held that the Wyoming legislature had clearly and validly established the courts and transfer processes for the trial of criminal offenses committed by persons under the age of majority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Wyoming State Board of Examiners of Optometry (board), sought review of decision of the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming), which granted summary judgment for appellees, a corporation and an optometrist, in the board's action for injunctive relief alleging violations of Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 33-23-110(b)(i), -103, and -111(b)(iv) (1977) based on a franchise agreement between the corporation and optometrist.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board filed a suit for injunctive relief, alleging, among other things, that a franchise agreement between the corporation and the optometrist for the marketing of optical products and services resulted in fee splitting or the employment of a &quot;steerer,&quot; in violation of &sect; 33-23-110(b)(i); that the corporation was engaged in the practice of optometry without a valid certificate in violation of &sect; 33-23-103; and that the corporation was engaged indirectly in the practice of optometry in violation of &sect; 33-23-111(b)(iv). The trial court entered summary judgment against the board. On review, the court affirmed, holding that the board did not establish any facts sufficient to raise an issue with respect to whether the optometrist divided his fees with the corporation. Without a showing of fraud, deceit, or overreaching that was practiced upon and resulted in harm to the public, the optometrist could not have been said to have employed the corporation as a &quot;steerer&quot; to direct patients to him through corporate advertising. Also, the trial court properly found that the corporation was not engaged in the corporate practice of optometry or the practice of optometry without a certificate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, the Environmental Quality Council (EQC), granted a coal mine permit in response to the application of respondent applicant without affording petitioners, a pipeline company and an oil company, the protection afforded by Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 35-11-406(b)(xii) and 35-11-416 (1977). The companies sought review of the decision of the EQC in the District Court of Campbell County (Wyoming), which certified the case to the court for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The EQC held that the applicant had met its burden of proof in establishing that the application was in compliance with applicable state laws. The issue was whether a long-term lessee of the land or a holder of a right-of-way easement was a &quot;surface landowner&quot; or &quot;surface owner&quot; under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 35-11-406(b)(xii), 35-11-416, and entitled to the protection of the statutory provisions requiring consent of a surface landowner and the posting of a bond to protect the surface owners. The court affirmed the decision of the EQC, holding that the pipeline company, as the holder of an easement, was not a statutorily protected surface landowner or surface owner. The court also found that the oil company, as a lessee, was not included within the statutory protections afforded the holders of the fee title in the property. The court concluded that the pipeline company and the oil company, as holders of other lesser interests constituting less than fee ownership, was not intended to be protected by Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 35-11-406(b)(xii), 35-11-416. Thus, the applicant complied with applicable state laws, and the EQC's decision to issue a permit and license to mine was proper.</SPAN></P>

The city passed an ordinance fining non-franchised gas companies operating there. The utility company sought a declaration that the ordinance was void. The district court held that only certain parts of the ordinance were void. The court reversed the decision of the district court, holding that the entire ordinance was void. First, Wyo. Stat.

Second, the city's attempt to regulate utility companies was outside the scope of the powers, including police powers that were expressly granted to it by the legislature. Third, the ordinance was not valid under Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15-1-103(a)(xiii) (1987 Cum. Supp.), authorizing the city to license any business therein for the purpose of raising revenue because the payments required by the ordinance only defrayed the city's regulatory costs.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant surety sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming), which affirmed the decision of the Environmental Quality Council (Council), the adjudicatory panel of the Department of Environmental Quality (Department) that denied a hearing request made by the surety prior to a ruling on a bond forfeiture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The surety issued a performance bond to a mining entity to which the Department had granted a mining permit to assure reclamation funds. The permit was transferred to several other entities, the last of which became insolvent and notified the Department that it was ceasing operations. The state attorney general notified the entity and the surety that it intended to seek forfeiture of the bond. The Council denied the surety's request for a hearing prior to a decision on the forfeiture. On appeal, the trial court affirmed; and on further appeal, the court reversed, holding that: 1) because of the equitable doctrine of legal subrogation, the surety was permitted to step into the shoes of the defunct mining entity; 2) the surety had the right to be heard in an administrative hearing to contest the amount of legally guaranteed loss or to deny liability; 3) issues of corporate and suretyship law sounding both in law and in fact were raised by the surety; and 4) where the surety had received no responses from the Department regarding the status of its insured, it was manifestly unfair to deny the hearing request.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which affirmed the Council's denial of the surety's request for a hearing on the issue of forfeiture of a reclamation bond.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On certification from the District Court of Laramie County (Wyoming), petitioner challengers, including trade associations, companies, and other groups, challenged the validity of a rule of respondent Wyoming State Board of Equalization, Department of Revenue and Taxation (board), that established a de facto tier property taxation assessment system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board promulgated a rule to provide varying property tax assessment ratios from 8 percent to 11.5 percent to be applied to the initially determined current value to establish computed &quot;assessed value&quot; for ad valorem taxation. Reduction percentages, an &quot;assessment ratio&quot; or &quot;debasement factor,&quot; were used to factor down the full-value property class appraisals. The challengers contended that the system established by rule violated the fair-equal-and-uniform and separation-of-power requirements of the Wyoming Constitution. Holding that the rule violated the Wyoming Constitution's fair-equal-and-uniform criteria, the court remanded. The court required the board to apply a statewide tax assessment ratio of 11.5 percent, effective March 15, 1988, unless by that date the legislature had enacted an alternate provision. The court held that variable assessment valuations as fractions of current market value were not permitted. Establishment of any assessment ratio which effectively determined the amount of tax to be paid, after fair market value's current value was established, was not a proper function of the board and was a nondelegable responsibility of the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the district court to enter a decree requiring the board to apply a statewide tax assessment ratio of 11.5 percent, effective March 15, 1988, unless by that date the legislature had enacted an alternative provision which meet the fair-equal-and-uniform criteria of the Wyoming Constitution. The court directed the district court to retain continued jurisdiction to secure compliance with the decree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to a charge of first-degree sexual assault as a result of a plea bargain in which a second charge of child abuse was dismissed, and the trial court entered a judgment and sentence against appellant based on that plea. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the trial court was not required to inform appellant of the law regarding specific intent because sexual assault was a general intent crime. The court found that the first-degree sexual assault statute,&nbsp;Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-2-302(a)(iii) (1977), did not require that appellant intend that his assault be for sexual abuse but instead that the facts and circumstances surrounding the incident could be reasonably construed as being for the purpose of sexual abuse. The court held that first-degree sexual assault could occur in the absence of sexual purpose. The court concluded that, if the facts and circumstances of the offense presented at the plea hearing could reasonably be construed to be for sexual abuse, that was sufficient although appellant's subjective intent might, according to his statement, have been something else.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that his conviction should have been set aside because the grand jury was not properly impaneled, and there was no specific finding of necessity for calling a grand jury. In addition, the indictments were allegedly fatally defective because the grand jury foreman did not personally endorse the words &quot;A True Bill&quot; upon the indictment, and the proceedings lacked reliability to determine probable cause. The supreme court affirmed the sentence and judgments of the defendants, concluding that the state followed proper prosecutorial procedure based on a presumption of regularity that included the administration of oaths, among other procedures. There were no constitutional defects or errors in connection with the indictments.</SPAN></P>

Upon appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the residency requirement of &sect; 23-2-404(d)(iii) did not assure the desired objectives nor correct any perceived evil, and the denial of defendant's application under &sect; 23-2-404(d)(iii) burdened the fundamental constitutional right to pursue one's chosen means of livelihood by imposing a discriminatory residence classification. The court held that classifications based on non-residency could not stand unless there was something to indicate that non-residents constituted a peculiar source of evil at which the statute was aimed. The court found no such evil. Because the degree of discrimination against non-residents did not bear a close relation to any of the State's asserted reasons for the discriminatory treatment, the court held that &sect; 23-2-404(d)(iii) violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of U.S. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Just days prior to their divorce, defendant sexually assaulted his wife, and a jury found defendant guilty of sexual assault and aggravated assault. Defendant argued that the marital exception statute,&nbsp;&sect; 6-2-307 rendered the sexual assault statute, &sect; 6-22-302, unconstitutional as applied to him. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court found that the standard by which defendant's conduct was to be measured was clearly outlined in &sect; 6-2-302(a)(1). Section 6-2-307 clearly put defendant on notice that marriage to the victim of the sexual assault was not a complete defense, but could have been considered along with other evidence in deciding his guilt.

The hospitals had denied the dentist's request for anesthesiology privileges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court on appeal from the denial of a declaratory judgment was asked to determine whether a person licensed to practice dentistry in Wyoming who had special training and experience in general anesthesia, but was not a licensed physician in Wyoming was authorized to practice general anesthesiology. The hospitals had denied the dentist's application for an appointment as a staff anesthesiologist. The dentist argued that the scope of dentistry as defined by the Wyoming Dental Practice Act, Wyo. Stat. Ann. &sect;33-15-114 (Cum. Supp. 1986), was sufficiently broad to include those procedures necessary in the general practice of anesthesiology by a dentist. Applying the general rules of statutory construction, the court determined that the legislature clearly intended the practice of dentistry to be limited to the diagnosis and treatment of the human mouth, teeth, and jaw, or oral cavity. The court noted that if the dentist desired to practice general non-dental anesthesiology he had to obtain a license to practice medicine. The court also noted that the dentist's equal protection rights were not violated when he was denied the right to practice clinical general anesthesiology.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 21-13-310(c) after the county assessor under-assessed education funding, and the local resource contributions was reduced within the total finding formula. The trial court held &sect; 21-13-310(c)&nbsp;unconstitutional and violative of Wyo. Const. art. 3, &sect; 2 and awarded the school district the withheld funds.

The court concluded that the school district's monetary claim was not barred where the letter informing the school district that the adjustment affected the district's valuation was not specific enough to start the claim period. The court concluded that the claim was not barred by sovereign immunity because it did not apply to proceedings between segments of state governments where declaratory judgment or administrative appeal provisions were available. The court held that the statute was, on its face, arbitrary and was not related to the allocation of school and capital funds where it attempted to require school district to police the responsibilities of the county assessor or bear the consequences of the assessor's errors.</SPAN></P>
