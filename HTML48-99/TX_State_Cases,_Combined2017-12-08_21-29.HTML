<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of driving while license suspended. Defendant contended the complaint did not sufficiently apprize him under which statute and subsection he was charged. The complaint and the information merely charged that defendant drove a motor vehicle upon the public highway when his operator's license was suspended On appeal the court held that under the Motor Vehicle Law, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6687b, and the Texas Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701h, a complaint and information charging the offense of driving while license suspended was subject to exception or motion to quash on the ground that it failed to recite under which article the license was suspended. The court overruled defendant's contention that both articles were unconstitutional because they both charged the same offense but provided different punishments. The court held that each was a separate offense, the difference being the grounds upon which the license was canceled or suspended. The court reversed the judgment and dismissed the prosecution under the complaint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on evidence that appellant struck a police officer while in jail, the jury convicted appellant of aggravated assault of a police officer and imposed the maximum punishment provided by law. Appellant challenged his conviction, arguing that the trial court erred in overruling his motion for a change of venue and that his punishment was excessive. In a substituted opinion, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. Because there was no evidence that appellant was prejudiced by the change of venue, a reversal was not required for a refusal to change venue. Moreover, appellant was not entitled to a change of venue in the misdemeanor case. With regard to punishment, the court explained that it was without authority to reduce appellant's sentence or to set aside the conviction upon the theory that the punishment was excessive despite its belief that a reduction of punishment was appropriate. Authority to grant pardons, reprieves, and commutations of punishment was vested in the governor on the recommendation of the Board of Pardons and Paroles (Texas).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers parked in a cotton field with their lights off observed defendant going 75 miles per hour in a 55 mile per hour speed zone. Officers used a portable radar device to measure defendant's car speed. Defendant appealed his conviction for speeding on grounds that officers impermissibly set up a speed trap in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 803a (repealed). The court found that art. 803a, which set speed traps, was unconstitutional. Defendant also claimed his motion for instructed verdict based on insufficient evidence was denied in error. Defendant claimed that officers were not qualified to testify about how the radar device worked and that experts were needed for this kind of testimony. The officers had testified that they had received instructions and had been trained in the device's operation and how to properly test for its accuracy. They conducted these tests both before and after defendant's speed was measured. The results were confirmed by a speedometer test. The court found the officers' testimony was sufficient, refusing to hold that expert testimony was needed to prove the device's accuracy or the speedometer's accuracy. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction and fine for speeding were affirmed. The statute prohibiting officers from lying in wait in order to observe speeding motorists was found unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction, which was entered by a trial court (Texas), for the unlawful possession of marihuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of the unlawful possession of marihuana. The court affirmed the conviction and found that a jury charge, which instructed the jury as to the punishment provided for a first offense of the unlawful possession of marihuana, did not constitute fundamental error. That instruction did not authorize the jury to assess a heavier punishment than that authorized by Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 725b, &sect; 23(1). The punishment assessed by the jury was allowed by the statute and by the trial court's charge, and the trial court was not required to quote the language of the statute in its jury charge. In its ruling, the court rejected defendant's contention that the statute was unconstitutional merely because it provided a life term as the maximum punishment for the unlawful possession of a narcotic drug. Caselaw that nullified a statute that dealt with addiction to the use of narcotics as a crime did not support defendant's contention that the statutory punishment for possession was cruel and unusual punishment within the terms of U.S. Const. amend. VIII, XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from a District Court of Bexar County (Texas), which convicted him of murder and sentenced him to seven years in prison after he had been adjudicated a delinquent child for the same offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 16 years old when he shot and killed another person after a minor altercation. A murder complaint was filed against defendant. Because of his age, he was turned over to juvenile authorities. The prosecution filed a delinquent child petition, which was followed by a motion for non-suit. That motion was overruled. The prosecution sought dismissal of the juvenile action prior to trial. That motion, and a subsequent motion for continuance, was overruled. After a jury trial, defendant was adjudicated a delinquent and committed to a juvenile facility. That judgment was upheld on appeal. The prosecution attempted to dismiss the appeal on the ground that defendant had become an adult that had been indicted for murder. The trial court in the criminal case overruled defendant's double jeopardy plea and his motion in arrest of judgment. He was convicted for the murder. On appeal, the court set the conviction aside and ordered the dismissal of the prosecution because defendant was not prosecuted for a separate felony. The conviction violated the principles of fundamental fairness and constituted a deprivation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator sought a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the validity of his arrest on the grounds that the statute, Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 1436-2, under which he was charged was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator was charged under a statute requiring persons who customarily engaged in the business of obtaining motor vehicles for scrap disposal or any other form of salvage to remove any unexpired license plates from the motor vehicle and place them under lock and key. The statute also required that all Certificates of Title covering such motor vehicles be surrendered to the State Highway Department for cancellation. The court rejected relator's argument that the statute was so vague and indefinite that it could not and did not apprise him of the nature of the charges against him in violation of Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 and that it deprived relator of due process of law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19, and Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 6. The court concluded that while the phrase &quot;substantially a larger percentage&quot; may have been indefinite, one who &quot;customarily&quot; or &quot;usually&quot; engages in a certain business conveyed sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practices. The statute was not unconstitutional where the unequal treatment of persons was based upon a reasonable and substantial classification..</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Criminal District Court No. 5 of Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of the unlawful possession of a narcotic drug, a violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 725b. Defendant's sentence was enhanced under Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 63 by reason of two prior convictions for felony offenses less than capital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant delivered to an undercover agent a narcotic substance, which was determined to have been 37.7 percent dolophine. The indictment charged defendant with the unlawful possession of a narcotic drug. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the indictment was proper because it alleged an offense under the law. The court rejected defendant's contention that that the indictment was fatally defective because dolophine was not one of the narcotic drugs named in Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 725, &sect; 1(14), and therefore defendant did not have notice of the offense with which he was charged. The court reasoned that even though dolophine was not named in the statutory definition of a narcotic drug, the proof showed that it was a narcotic drug and registered under such a trade name. Further, the proof showed that dolophine was one of the same chemical formula and substance as &quot;amidone,&quot; which was named in the statute. Therefore, the description of the drug by its trade name was sufficient to charge an offense and apprise defendant of the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the County Court at Law, El Paso County (Texas), that convicted defendant of shoplifting, in violation of Tex. Penal Code art. 1436e. Defendant was sentenced to 30 days in jail and was assessed a fine of $ 50.00.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant paid for several items at a store, and shortly after leaving, he was confronted by the store's managers about three items he did not pay for. He first denied taking them, but then removed two items from his pocket and the other fell while moving his arms. His offer to pay for them was refused. The value of the items stolen was $ 1.23. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim that art. 1436e was unconstitutional. Although art. 1436e did not mention the State's pleadings in providing for increased punishment or a felony, it was essential that such conviction be properly alleged if the State sought to enhance the punishment or create an offense based on a prior conviction. Because under Tex. Penal Code art. 1423 the legislature could make the theft of any kind of property a felony or misdemeanor, regardless of its value, where the punishment was specially prescribed, and because the legislature intended to enact a special statute defining shoplifting, the justice of the peace courts, which could not assess imprisonment pursuant to Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19 and Tex. Crim. Stat. art. 60, were not unconstitutionally deprived of jurisdiction of theft offenses under $ 5.</SPAN></P>

He sought unsuccessfully to quash the information on the ground that it failed to allege that the knife was manufactured for the purpose of offense or defense. He was convicted as charged. On appeal, the court found that the trial court properly refused to quash the information, because Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 483 provided that such an allegation was not essential when the length of the blade was stated. The court found also that that portion of the article that made it unlawful to carry a knife with a blade over five and one-half inches in length was not unconstitutional for being vague because there was nothing vague or indefinite in the description of a knife with a blade over five and one-half inches in length and no need to guess at its meaning. The court noted that the legislature had the power to regulate the wearing of arms with a view to prevent crime and that art. 484 provided reasonable exemptions under which such arms could be carried; therefore, those provisions of art. 483 which were definite and certain were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Those accused under the county ordinance which the court violated could potentially be fined up to $ 200. The court decided that this discrepancy violated defendant's equal protection rights. Under Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3 and U.S. Const. amend. 14, all persons similarly situated were entitled to equal protection. These constitutional provisions applied to municipal ordinances. Unequal treatment of persons was only justified under state laws if it was based upon a reasonable and substantial classification of persons.

Supervision of relator's parole was to be exercised by the parole authorities of Texas. Ohio authorities had issued a warrant charging relator with a parole violation and directing her return to a penal institution in Ohio. Relator filed the underlying application seeking a writ of habeas corpus securing her release from custody on the ground that the Uniform Act for Out-of-State Parolee Supervision (Act), Tex. Crim. Stat. art. 781c (1951), was unconstitutional. The Act authorized the Governor of Texas to enter into a compact with any other state providing for the supervision of parolees from other states. The Act provided that the Governor of Texas was authorized to execute such compacts on behalf of the State of Texas if the compact &quot;substantially&quot; followed the form enumerated in the statute. The court rejected relator's contention that use of the word &quot;substantially&quot; in the body of the Act was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch of government.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of possessing obscene magazines for sale. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction by finding that, although art. 527 was constitutional, the county court's failure to give defendant's requested charges as to the proper test of obscenity was reversible error given the possibility of acquittal if the jury had determined that the magazines were not obscene pursuant to the appropriate test.</SPAN></P>

A witness saw defendant run out of the girlfriend's office hunched over and carrying something near his waist. The girlfriend then ran out of her office shouting that she had been robbed. Two men from the bar chased defendant. When police arrived, they found that defendant was carrying the same amount of money that had been taken from the bar. Defendant had two prior felony convictions in another state, so upon his conviction for felony theft, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the felony convictions in the other state were properly used to enhance defendant's sentence. It was not necessary under the sentence enhancing statutes that the offense in the foreign state be identical in all its elements with one punishable as a felony in Texas, a substantial similarity being sufficient. Although defendant had appealed his conviction in the other state, the appellate court had not yet acted upon the appeal, so the conviction remained a final conviction usable for enhancement under Tex.

The bomb was described as a combustible substance, to-wit, gasoline contained and controlled within a container. The indictment further alleged that the container had a wick making the bomb capable by its ignition and explosion of causing damage to persons and property. The indictment was drawn under Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 1723. The trial court denied defendant's motion to quash the indictment. Upon a plea of nolo contendre, defendant was convicted of the offense and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. On appeal, defendant claimed that art. 1723 was unconstitutional. The court held that the statute was valid and constitutional. The statute did not impose an unreasonable restriction upon the use and enjoyment of lawful property because it did not apply to possession of the prohibited substances when used for industrial, mechanical, laboratory, or medical purposes.</SPAN></P>

The State's evidence indicated that defendant's wife was in the automobile at the time the shots were fired. Defendant testified that she was out of the car and out of the line of fire, and that he fired some 12 shots into the automobile in an effort to keep his wife at home with her children by destroying the automobile. Defendant had been previously convicted for assaulting his wife with a machine gun. Defendant appealed from the conviction, challenging the denial of his motion to quash the indictment on the ground that his prior conviction was for the same offense and further prosecution would constitute double jeopardy. The court affirmed, holding that the statute making it unlawful to possess a machine gun was not violative of the state constitution, and that the district court did not err in ruling that prosecution for possession of the machine gun was not barred under the theory of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stopped his automobile near police motorcycles and asked an officer a question. During the course of the conversation the officer observed a &quot;night stick&quot; or &quot;police club&quot; or &quot;police stick&quot; or &quot;billy club&quot; protruding from under the front seat and placed defendant under arrest for carrying the same. Defendant, testifying in his own behalf, said that he was a collector for an insurance company and that he carried the night stick for his own protection since he sometimes carried large sums of money. The information was drawn in conformity with a criminal form book but alleged the arms to be &quot;a night stick&quot; as included in the 1957 amendment to Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 483. The title of that statute was sufficient to authorize the inclusion in the body of the act of any provision within its scope when the &quot;main subject&quot; or &quot;ultimate object&quot; of the act was clearly, definitely, fairly and fully, expressed, meaning that was expressed as well as can reasonably be expected in a brief and general statement.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the jury properly resolved the conflicting evidence against defendant, and the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict. Defendant contended that the trial court should not have admitted two pistols into evidence because it was never shown that they were in his possession. However, the court ruled that the fact the pistols were obtained in an automobile search outside defendant's presence did not render them inadmissible. Further, defendant was in no position to complain of the search in which the pistols were found because defendant's companion was the owner of the automobile. The court noted that one of the pistols was identified by a witness as like the pistol in defendant's possession on the night in question and the other one as like the pistol in possession of his companion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 754b, which applied to prosecution of persons other than licensed practitioners, was unconstitutional because it was in conflict with Tex. Const. art. 16, &sect; 31. Defendant argued that dentistry, as then defined, was a school of medicine and that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 754b violated the constitutional provision by allowing a conviction based upon the testimony of an accomplice without corroboration. The court overruled the motion for a rehearing because Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 754b as applied to prosecution of persons other than licensed practitioners was not in conflict with the constitutional provision. The court held that the constitutional provision was merely a limitation upon the previous general power of prescribing qualifications for practitioners and punishments. The court held that malpractice by members of a profession and unlawful practice by one not a licensed practitioner were separate and distinct wrongs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer observed defendant driving erratically and pulled her over.

Defendant was further identified as the person convicted previously of a misdemeanor conviction for drunken driving. He was convicted. On appeal, the court held that it was not error to use a prior conviction alleged in the indictment merely because a prior judgment of conviction provided for a probated jail term under unconstitutional statute. A judgment or sentence containing an irregularity, that could be reformed on appeal or by nunc pro tunc entry, was not void and could be collaterally attacked.

The victim was taken to a doctor who examined her and observed evidence that she was sexually abused. Other witnesses confirmed that defendant was in the vicinity of the victim's home shortly before she testified that he came to the door. After defendant's arrest, he confessed. He was convicted after a trial. Appeal was taken on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel and on a challenge of the constitutionality of the death penalty. The court held that the rights of defendant were protected by two court-appointed attorneys who had practiced eight years or more and had previously tried capital cases. The court further held that a statute authorizing execution of those who had been assessed the death penalty was not unconstitutional because it was not uniformly enforced.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant claimed that the Adult Probation and Parole Law of 1957, Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 781d, was so vague and indefinite that it violated both the Texas and United States Constitutions. He claimed that art. 781d narrowed a judge's discretion in revocation of parole and that the legislature did not clearly provide that the review would be limited to whether an abuse of discretion was shown. In overruling the contention that art. 781d was unconstitutional, the court found that its provisions were substantially the same as a superseded act. The enactment of art. 781d in effect adopted the construction placed on the prior statute. In construing the prior statute, the court had held that whether the statute's benefits were to be accorded to an accused rested within the discretion of the trial court. The court had previously held that probation could be revoked upon a finding by the trial court as a fact that the terms of probation had been violated and that the review would be limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in revoking probation. Based on the construction of the previous statute, art. 781d was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the judgment was contrary to the law because he was improperly charged with more than one offense in the same complaint, in violation of Tex. Crim. Stat. art. 408a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his convictions on technical grounds, in that he was improperly charged with more than one offense in the same complaint, which situation was prohibited by Tex. Crim. Stat. art. 408a. The State contended that art. 408a was unconstitutional because it contained more than one subject, thus violating Tex. Const. art. &sect; 35 prohibiting such a bill. The court found the statute constitutional because the entire statute related to the State's pleading in criminal cases. Thus, it did not violate the one-subject rule. Further, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that because defendant pled guilty to the three misdemeanors charged and failed to attack the complaint or otherwise complain in the trial court of being tried for more than one misdemeanor under a single complaint and information, he waived his right to be separately charged and tried, and could not be heard to complain for the first time on appeal that art. 408a was not complied with.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two narcotic officers testified that, armed with the search warrant, they went to a certain lot on which there was a house. One officer went around the house and encountered defendant. He searched defendant's person and found a quantity of bulk substance, which was later shown to be marijuana, in his pants pocket. When the other officer joined them, defendant reached in his shirt pocket and handed him what was later shown to be a marijuana cigarette. On appeal, the court held that although nothing in Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 314 authorized the incorporation of an arrest warrant in a search warrant, this constituted a valid warrant of arrest, authorizing defendant's arrest and the incident search of his person. The court also found the warrant was supported by a sufficient affidavit. The affidavit stated that the officers had reason to believe that defendant had narcotics in his possession. It further stated that the officers had received reliable information from a credible person that heroin, marijuana, barbiturates, amphetamine, and other narcotics and narcotic paraphernalia were being kept at the premises for the purpose of sale and use contrary to the provisions of the law.</SPAN></P>

The court found that such an invasion of the constitutional rights of citizens was unwarranted. It held that a denial of due process of law resulted from any statute, whether state or federal, that took away any of the essential attributes of private property or imposed unreasonable restrictions on its use and enjoyment. It held that &sect; (3) clearly imposed an unreasonable restriction upon the use and enjoyment of a lawful commodity and was, therefore, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

At trial, defendant did not testify or offer any evidence in his own behalf except a judgment of a county court that found him to be a person of unsound mind and committed him to a state hospital, plus proof that the docket in the case reflected no further order by that court. The State introduced in evidence a certificate of the superintendent of the state hospital, discharging defendant as being without psychosis. The trial court refused defendant's request to charge the jury that an unvacated judgment of lunacy, when introduced in evidence, created a presumption that defendant was insane and shifted the burden upon the State to prove the contrary. The court found that this was the law prior to the enactment of the Mental Health Code, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 5547-5581, in 1957. The court reversed and concluded that because the statute deprived defendant of a presumption and altered the rules of evidence, it would be unconstitutional as ex post facto if applied to a discharge dated before the effective date of the act. Thus, the trial court erred in failing to give the requested charge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens brought an action against relators challenging the constitutionality of an ordinance that prohibited the keeping of chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and peafowl within 100 feet of a residence, hospital, church, or school. The trial judge issued a temporary injunction that prohibited relators from enforcing the ordinance against the citizens or others. Relators filed a petition for a writ of prohibition to preclude the judge from taking any further action on the injunction. The court denied the petition, holding that the trial court had jurisdiction to issue the writ. The court noted that a writ of prohibition was an appropriate vehicle to restrain acts that a trial court had no legal authority to exercise. The court found that the defendants who were restrained in this case filed an appeal from the injunction. The jurisdiction of the district court to entertain the action for an injunction was not questioned in the appellate court, the court wrote. Because the enjoined defendants invoked the appellate court's jurisdiction, that court, not the present court, had the authority to pass on whether the trial judge acted properly in granting the temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed error in not charging the jury on her right to defend against a milder attack than a deadly attack and in not allowing a statement of her defense after a witness testified to defendant's good reputation. The court affirmed. Defendant saw no weapon in the possession of the decedent and the most that could be said was that the decedent was preparing to make an attack. There was no necessity to give the charge of defendant's right to defend against a milder attack because it was not applicable when the decedent was about to make an attack but only when there was an actual attack. Tex. Crim. Stat. art. 642 granted to defendant a certain time and place to make a statement of her defense. To avail herself of such right, she had to either assert it in its proper order or show good reason for not doing so.

The officer testified that the vehicle's description, license plate number, and route of travel matched information that the officer had received from an informer. He testified that he found a bag on the vehicle's front seat that contained cash and policy plays. On appeal, defendant argued that the information was defective for failing to cite the policy plays verbatim. The court affirmed the conviction. Defendant's argument that Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 642c, &sect; 2 was unconstitutional failed based on a holding from an earlier case that art. 642c, &sect; 2 was constitutional. The money found in the bag was admissible because the money could have shown that the slips of paper in the bag were policy plays as the State contended. Defendant's warrantless arrest and the warrantless seizure of the bag were proper given the probable cause supplied by the informer's information and the traffic violations that defendant committed in the officer's presence. The officer had a duty to pursue defendant even after defendant drove out of the city limits. The informer's identity did not have to be revealed.</SPAN></P>

The State produced the affidavit and warrant and the trial court found it sufficient. The ruling of a trial judge was presumed correct and the burden rested upon defendant to establish the contrary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's testimony showed that defendant was arrested in a store after she and her companion were seen taking radios. A search revealed a paper bag underneath her clothing that contained an eye dropper, a hypodermic needle, a bottle cap, and a piece of cotton. The eye dropper, cotton, and bottle cap contained diacetylmorphine. Defendant's uncle testified that as far as he knew, defendant was not a doctor, dentist, veterinarian, nurse, pharmacist, dealer in surgical instruments, or an attendant or intern of a hospital, sanatorium, or institution where persons were treated for disability or disease. In affirming the decision, the court found the evidence sufficient to support the conviction. The court overruled defendant's contention that the State failed to prove that she was not a person exempt from the provisions of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 725b, &sect; 2(c). Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 725b, &sect; 21 provided that it was not necessary to negate any exception and that the burden of proof of any exception was upon a defendant. Tex.

On appeal, however, the court upheld the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of driving while under the influence of drugs. Specifically, the court held that if part of the statute was rejected as surplusage, it still denounced the offense of driving while under the influence of a drug. Similarly, the court rejected defendant's argument that since the evidence did not show that defendant was under the influence of a narcotic drug, it was error for the trial court to mention that in the charge. Instead, the court held that the trial court could have properly stated the general principles of law defining the offense charged and then made a direct and pertinent application of the law to the case. Next, the court held that the trial court did not err when it failed to submit defendant's defense of &quot;sickness.&quot; Lastly, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court did not define some terms from the statute. Rather, the court noted that the trial court did not need to define non-technical terms having an ordinary or commonly understood meaning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from the County Criminal Court of Tarrant County (Texas), which convicted defendant of unlawful practice of dentistry. A jury imposed a fine and a jail term. Defendant was convicted under plural counts of an information with two separate offenses of practicing dentistry without a license with a prior conviction of an offense of like character alleged to enhance punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's witness testified that he went to defendant's dental laboratory and received a set of false teeth after paying a fee to defendant. The witness further testified that he was sent to defendant by a licensed a dentist to have the teeth made for the purpose of testifying in court. The State presented proof that defendant had not been licensed to practice dentistry in the State. Defendant did not testify. The State presented no proof to identify defendant as the person named in the information and judgment of conviction for a prior alleged offense. On appeal, defendant's sole contention was that the conviction could not be sustained because it was based upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. The court held that: (1) in the absence of proof that defendant was the same person who had been previously convicted, as alleged, the jury's verdict under the second count of the information could not be sustained; and (2) the legislature had the power to enact Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 754b, which provided that the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice was sufficient to sustain a conviction for violation of any of the statutes pertaining to dentistry.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reformed the judgment so as to fix defendant's punishment at a fine and confinement in jail under the first count of the indictment only, with the State to recover of defendant the fine and costs. As reformed, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction under the first count of the information. The court reversed the judgment of conviction under the second count and, as to the second count, remanded the cause to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

After testing, the State's chemist declared the tablets to contain a derivative of barbituric acid. Defendant was charged with and convicted of possession of a barbiturate. Defendant appealed, contending that the jury was improperly charged and that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional. The court disagreed, holding that the complaint regarding the charge could not be considered because defendant made no objection at trial and did not file a requested charge in writing, as required by Tex. Crim. Stat. arts. 658, 659. The statute that made delivery of a barbiturate illegal had previously been sustained against attacks as to its constitutionality, and the same rule was applicable to the statute making possession of a barbiturate illegal. Both statutes placed on defendant the burden of showing facts by which the delivery or possession of the barbiturates was excepted, excused, or exempted under the statute, which defendant failed to do. His claim that he received the pills from the VA Hospital was not corroborated.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that a statute prohibiting under penalty the driving of a vehicle on the highway at a speed greater than was reasonable and prudent, having regard to the traffic and use of the way, and specifying what speed shall be prima facie unlawful under designated circumstances, was not void for uncertainty. The court concluded that the provisions of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 827a, &sect; 8(1)(b) fixing a 60 mile speed limit and providing that any speed in excess thereof shall be prima facie evidence that the speed was not reasonable or prudent and that it was unlawful, rendered the 1951 amendment and re-enactment of Tex.

This was sufficient to charge a violation of the statute under the 1941 amendment and prior to its amendments in 1951 and 1954. The court found that the 1941 law was never repealed. The act of 1951 did not expressly repeal the 1941 act but provided that &sect; 8 of the act be re-enacted and amended. The 1941 statute, Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating a city loitering ordinance and brought an action contesting the constitutionality of the ordinance. The city sought a rehearing from the court on its determination that, although the ordinance was not in conflict with the vagrancy statute in Tex. Penal Code art. 607, it was unconstitutional as an unreasonable restraint upon personal liberty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city sought a rehearing on the constitutionality of its ordinance attempting to punish defendant for being idle within 250 feet of a school or public building. The court denied the city's motion for a rehearing. The court noted that the ordinance was different from Tex. Penal Code art. 607, which punished persons with the characteristics of a vagrant as defined as all able-bodied persons who habitually loafed, loitered, and idled in a public place for a large portion of their time without any regular employment or visible means of support. The court found that the wording of the ordinance could punish any good and deserving person for vagrancy for a single act of idleness near a school or public building and that the ordinance in that way infringed on the personal liberty of such persons to be at those places. The court concluded that a violation under the ordinance could not be left to the particular facts of the situation because it would then be void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

Defendant protested his warrantless arrest. The court reversed the conviction and remanded the case. The court found that the warrantless arrest did not fall under the descriptions listed in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 212 or 215. In addition, Tex. Penal Code art. 725b, &sect;&sect; 14, 15, provided no support. In order to hold those sections constitutional, the belief mentioned in the statutes had to be such as would constitute probable cause authorizing the arrest and search. To hold otherwise would be to allow arrests based on mere suspicion. The statutes had to be interpreted to require that the officers have some information that defendant was violating the law plus some act on defendant's part that would bolster and support such belief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to the killing. He raised the issue of self-defense, contrary to his confession, which he denied having made. His conviction was reversed on appeal, and the State filed a motion for rehearing. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting defendant's confession over his objection on the ground that the warning was not given by the person to whom the confession was made. The confession recited that the person to whom the statement was made gave the required warning. The record showed that the interrogator was present at all times while the confession was being made and that he warned defendant that he did not need to make a statement. In its charge, the trial court instructed the jury not to consider the confession if they believed or had a reasonable doubt that it was not made to the interrogator as stated. Thus, under the facts, the charge of the trial court fully protected defendant's rights. The court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 2094, which provided for the drawing of jurors from a jury wheel, was applicable in the county, which had a population of less than 58,000. The trial court had the inherent power to provide for a special venire.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's petition for habeas corpus relief was based upon the allegation that there was no valid statute under which he could be prosecuted for such conduct and personal condition.

Appellant alleged that the amended statute was an attempt by the legislature to revise a former law that had been declared wholly void. Appellant essentially contended that because the former law had been declared void, it occupied the same status as that of a repealed statute. The court affirmed the district court's judgment and denied habeas corpus relief, holding that Article 725c, as amended, was valid, and that appellant's confinement was not unlawful. The court stated that a statute that had been held unconstitutional by the courts did not lose its existence, at least for the purpose of amendment.</SPAN></P>

(Tex. 1955) was void and that the jury wheel system applied in Guadalupe County, Texas. The court held that ch. 2, 54th Leg. (Tex. 1955) was void. Under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. arts. 2094 and 2095, the jury wheel system for drawing and selecting petit juries was applicable and controlling in each county having two or more district courts holding session therein and having a population in excess of 20,000 inhabitants according the last preceding federal census. Chapter 2, 54th Leg. (Tex. 1955) provided that the judicial district in which Guadalupe County, Texas, was located was removed the jury wheel system and placed under the jury commission system. Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 56 prohibited the Texas Legislature from passing any local or special law authorizing, summoning, or empanelling petit juries. The jury wheel law, Tex. Rev. Civ.

Therefore, under the Act, a jury trial was to be had to a jury of six rather than 12, in accordance with Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 29. The inmate was convicted of the same offense under both Tex. Penal Code Ann. arts. 534 and 534a. Therefore, even though art. 534a was subsequently held void, art. 534a did not repeal Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 534, which was valid and constitutional. A charge to the jury was beneficial to the inmate, so he could not be heard to complain about it on a collateral attack.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also cited 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3182, which was the exclusive extradition act between States prior to the adoption of the Act, required an affidavit made before a magistrate. The court ruled that art. 1008a was not unconstitutional because it had not sought to abridge or lessen the duty placed upon the chief executive of the asylum State. The court ruled that the extradition demand made fell under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 1008a, &sect; 2, which only mandated an information supported by affidavit. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the extradition affidavit was insufficient to support the information because it was made several days after the information was filed but prior to the issuance of the demand because the date of supporting affidavits had no bearing upon their sufficiency.</SPAN></P>

The indictment against defendant was returned by the regularly impaneled grand jury in a district court and not by a hold-over grand jury in a second district court. In overruling the motion, the court held that it was not impressed with defendant's contention that, because Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 13 provides that a grand jury was to be composed of 12 men, Tex. Crim. Stat. art. 338a was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the existence of two grand juries in the same county at the same time. The trial court erred against the State when it sustained an objection to the district attorney's argument that an officer had gone to the scene in order to arrest defendant for a breach of the peace. The court declined to approve the practice of allowing photographers to take pictures in the courtroom during the course of a trial, but a photographer had asked permission of the trial court to take a picture of the entire courtroom scene, and defendant did not object.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the present case was distinguished from these cases in that Arkansas allowed prosecution by information alone, that the information filed here was itself an affidavit, and that affidavits were before the Governor of Arkansas when he issued the requisition certifying that appellant stood charged by &quot;affidavit, information and warrant.&quot; Next, the court rejected appellant's argument that the extradition papers on their face showed that the prosecution was an attempt to enforce a private claim and to imprison appellant for not paying a money debt. The requisition from the Governor certified that the offense charged against appellant was a crime in Arkansas.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State contended that Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 534(a) was void because it contained a provision for suspension of sentence in the nature of probation and thus violated Tex. Const. art.

The court noted that, in addition to its provision for suspended sentence or probation, Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 534(a) also reduced the jail term for the offense to not exceed six months and conferred the exclusive jurisdiction of the offense upon juvenile courts. The court held that art. 534(a) was void and did not repeal art. 534. Thus, art. 534, as amended by 1949 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 500, remained the statute applicable to the offense of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and jurisdiction of the offense was in a county court. Although defendant contended that he was entitled to a reversal of the conviction because he was not present when members of the jury panel were questioned and selected, he failed to raise the issue by bill of exception and thus it was not before the court for review.</SPAN></P>

Relator contended that the act under which he was convicted was void and created no offense because the Adult Probation and Parole Act, Tex. Crim. Stat. art. 781b, (the Parole Act) was applied to convictions under the act. The court found that because the Parole Act was inapplicable to misdemeanors, the legislature was without lawful authority to apply the Parole Act to relator. The court determined that the inclusion of the void probation and parole feature of the act destroyed the whole of the act. When the probation feature went out of the act, not only an integral part of the act went out but also a part of the punishment affixed to a violation of the act went out with it. The court stated that because the legislature would not have passed the act without the void provision, the section applying the probation and parole law permeated the entire act and rendered it void.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the intent of the legislature could be determined from the act, which was that the compulsory jail term portion was the prime purpose, and the provision as to commutation or probation was only incidental; therefore, the legislature would not have failed to enact the amendment providing for a compulsory jail term though they had known that the provision for commutation was invalid. The court declined to overrule that legislative intent. In any event, the court noted that the appeal was not controlled by the soundness or unsoundness of the other case's opinion because, even if the entire amendment of art. 802 was void, the trial court did not err in accepting defendant's plea of guilty and assessing his punishment; probation, suspension of sentence, or commutation was applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was defendant's motion for rehearing. The court, had on the original submission, declined to consider an attack made upon the constitutionality of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 802, as amended, upon the theory that if the amendment was void the conviction, in respect to defendant's sentence, could be sustained under the prior article. The court was in error, and thus the issue was the constitutionality of the amended article.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was in error in respect to the original submission because under former art. 802 there was no authority for the imposition of a jail term of less than 10 days. Thus, because defendant's punishment was three days in jail and a certain fine, his judgment of conviction could not have been upheld unless art. 802, as amended, was valid. Art. 802, as amended, provided for a mandatory jail term of not less than three days nor more than two years in addition to a fine. The article contained a proviso stating that the presiding judge had discretion to commute a jail sentence to a probation period of not less than six months. The court stated that, if to commute punishment meant to change it from that assessed against a convicted defendant into a less severe one, the proviso was in violation of Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11, which vested such power in the Governor. The court found, however, that art. 802 could be upheld because the unconstitutional proviso could be stricken and the remainder of the statute was complete in itself. The court thus overruled defendant's motion for a rehearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a violation of an ordinance that prohibited the sale of beer on Sunday during the time mentioned in Tex. Penal Code art. 667-10 and, in addition, the remainder of the day. A trial court convicted defendant and assessed a fine. The case was appealed to county court where defendant was again convicted and a greater fine was assessed. On appeal from that conviction, defendant contended that the ordinance was void because it was in conflict with the state law, in that it prescribed a different and lesser punishment than that fixed by the state law for the same unlawful act. The court found that there was no question that certain provisions of the ordinance were void for the reason stated, because it did fix a different punishment than that prescribed by state law for the same acts. The court held that it was constrained to agree that the ordinance, in so far as it prohibited the sale of beer at five p.m. on Sunday, was authorized by Tex. Penal Code art. 667-10-1/2. The court held that defendant was convicted under a valid ordinance and that there was no reversible error.</SPAN></P>

While defendant argued that the legislation was discriminatory in favor of those who owned minnow hatcheries in named counties, the court held that such distinctions were not unconstitutional as the purpose of the legislation was to preserve minnows raised in public waters rather than private hatcheries. The court found that the enactment of the legislation was not void under Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 57, based on existing precedent. Although defendant alleged that H.B. 89, art. 978j, violated Tex. Const. art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion for rehearing of the court's decision that declined to find that the ordinance that defendant was convicted of violating was void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that he had not met the ordinance's requirements. The court's review of the question, therefore, had to be limited to the city's constitutional power to enact an ordinance prohibiting the keeping of more than 12 chickens within 100 feet of the residence of another. Defendant had to overcome the finding of the city council, stated in the preamble to the ordinance, that it was necessary to the interest of public health and welfare to prohibit the keeping of certain animals and to regulate the keeping of certain other animals and poultry within the city limits. Those findings and the enactment of the ordinance made a prima facie showing that the ordinance was reasonable and placed the burden upon defendant to disapprove it. In overruling the motion for rehearing, the court held that an examination of the record not only reflected that defendant was unable to meet that burden, but also showed that the trial court had before it sufficient evidence to authorize a finding that a business, as operated by defendant, reasonably endangered and threatened the health of the public.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed, reversing and remanding his conviction. The court held that Tex.

However, the court held that the county court was in session during an additional term validly established by order of the commissioners' court. In addition to the four terms required by the constitution, the commissioners' court had established four additional terms. Defendant's arraignment had occurred during one of these additional terms. The court declared unconstitutional the statute limiting the number of county court terms to six during the year. Defendant's arraignment took place two days after his arrest and in the presence of the arresting state agents. In the interim he was held in the county jail and not permitted by the sheriff to call his father. He testified that he did not ask for an attorney because he was scared. However, because the trial court advised him of his right to an attorney, the court found no error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State's theory was that defendant, while intoxicated, drove his car into the car of the deceased causing injuries to the deceased from which he died. Defendant claimed that the deceased caused the collision. Defendant alleged that reference to a confession in the State attorney's closing argument, which had not been admitted in evidence, and that the confession was different from that which defendant testified to, was prejudicial. The court reversed. The evidence as to who was the cause of the collision was based on circumstantial evidence but was sufficient to raise an issue of fact for the jury to determine. The State attorney's argument violated the provisions of Tex. Crim. Stat. arts. 727, 727a, which prohibited the use of a confession if it was made while defendant was in jail or while in custody unless it was made voluntarily. Because the purported confession was not admitted in evidence, it was highly improper to tell the jury that defendant had sworn differently in the confession than he did while testifying.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the District Court of Hill County (Texas), which convicted defendant of drunken driving, on the ground that 1947 Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 271, the legislative act that transferred jurisdiction of civil and criminal cases from the county court to the district court, was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the district court that conducted his trial did not have the jurisdiction to do so. He claimed that the 1947 legislative act that transferred jurisdiction of such cases from the county court to the district court was unconstitutional. Defendant argued that in specifically directing the transfer from one court to the other in Hill County, the act was a local law and no notice of the intention to pass the act was published, as required by Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 57. The court distinguished local or special laws from general laws, and concluded that the act was a general law. Therefore, no such notice was ever needed. It was a general law because the public at large had an interest in the matter, even if it applied to a specific locality. In addition, the act was not void for vagueness. Defendant claimed that it failed to completely describe the district court by its full title and thus identified a court not recognized by the state. The court held that a 1905 legislative act created one and only one district court in Hill County, and that the 66th Judicial District of Hill County consisted of only one county. Hence, the district court was adequately identified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act made the reckless driving of an automobile upon a public highway a misdemeanor. The Act defined &quot;reckless driving&quot; as driving any vehicle in wilful or wanton disregard of the rights or safety of others or without due caution or circumspection, and at a speed or in a manner so as to endanger or be likely to endanger a person or property. Relator stood convicted in the county court of driving an automobile upon a public highway without due caution or circumspection. Relator contended that the words &quot;without due caution or circumspection&quot; were so vague and indefinite and of such doubtful construction as to render the statute wholly inoperative under Tex. Penal Code art. 6 and violative of Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 and the Due Process Clauses of both the state and federal constitutions. The court determined that the words &quot;without due caution or circumspection,&quot; standing alone, imported nothing more or less than ordinary negligence, or a failure to exercise that degree of care that a person of ordinary prudence would exercise under the same or similar circumstances. The provision was vague and indefinite as criminal prosecutions for mere negligent acts were not authorized.</SPAN></P>

The plumber filed a writ of habeas corpus seeking to release from custody, claiming that art. 6243-101 was unconstitutional and void where the state's police power did not extend to regulation of the plumbing business and violated the equal protection clauses of the Texas Constitution and the United States Constitution because it was discriminatory and arbitrary class legislation. The trial court denied the plumber's writ and remanded him back to custody. The plumber appealed. The court ruled that art. 6243-101 was a valid exercise of the state's police power because the plumbing business concerned the installation and maintenance of water, gas, and sewer lines, which were directly related to the health, safety and welfare of the public. Furthermore, art. 6243-101 was not violative of equal protection where a reasonable basis existed for exempting those engaged in the plumbing business in smaller cites because the danger to the public health and safety sought to be guarded against was not equal and uniform in all of the cities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance that required the ambulance driver to have permission before he answered an &quot;emergency call.&quot; The corporation court convicted the ambulance driver of violation of the ordinance and fined him $ 25.

The court determined that the use of police power had to be &quot;reasonable&quot; in order to be valid under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 3, 19. The ordinance was unreasonable, arbitrary, and discriminatory, and the purpose of the ordinance, to prevent racing on the streets by ambulances, was partially controlled by the speed laws.

Stat. art. 5153, which made it lawful for union members to induce by peaceful means any person to accept any particular employment or refuse to do so, and that the ordinance unconstitutionally abridged the freedom of speech. The court ruled that the ordinance was not in conflict with art. 5153, but that relator was entitled to the relief he sought because the ordinance was void as being in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that it was an unreasonable restraint on the freedom of speech.

The court did not decide whether defendant association's conduct was state action, but determined there was no evidence supporting the trial court's conclusion that the rule was unreasonable, capricious, or arbitrary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a county bail bond board, revoked a license to execute bail bonds. The trial court held that the appeal from appellant's action was subject to a de novo standard of review, as opposed to a substantial evidence standard of review. Appellant failed to adduce any proof, following the trial court's ruling as to the standard of review, and the trial court entered a take-nothing judgment against appellant. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court explained that the statutes governing licensure of bail bond issuers do not contemplate a discretionary venture by appellant, nor the exercise by it of a legislative rule-making power. The court concluded that the purpose of the statutes and the procedures set forth therein were adjudicatory in nature. Accordingly, the court concluded that since appellant's decision to revoke a bail bond license was judicial in nature, its review was subject to the de novo standard of review.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held five sections of the Act void for vagueness, ordered partial access to the records requested, and denied access to others. Both sides appealed. Appellant argued that the Act was valid and required full access to all requested records, and appellees sought denial of access. The court reversed and rendered judgment. The court ruled that the Act was not constitutionally defective, and held that the police blotter, show-up sheet, and arrest sheet were public records available to the press and public under the Act, but that the offense report, personal history, and arrest record were excluded by Tex.

On appeal from the district court's order upholding appellee's findings, the court affirmed and held that practicing dentistry encompassed and included the practice of medicine under color of the practice of dentistry, which was unprofessional conduct.

The court held that venue was sustainable because the proof was sufficient to establish a cause of action against either appellant, there was proof to support findings that appellants maintained an agent in the county at the time the suit was filed, and there was sufficient pleading alleging that either appellant was a foreign corporation. Appellants' other contentions that appellee lacked an insurable interest in the building and that one of the venue statutes was unconstitutional were deemed meritless.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that that portion of the Texas Unemployment Compensation Act (Act), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The court held that there was substantial evidence to support the trial court's judgment and defendant's decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officers brought an action against appellees, the city of Houston, the mayor, the chief of police, and certain officers of the Civil Service Commission to review an order of temporary suspension and promotional by-pass entered by the commission under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1269(m). The trial held that the suspension order could not stand because it was based upon an unconstitutional order requiring appellants to submit to a polygraph examination. The trial court concluded that it was without jurisdiction to rule on the promotional by-pass and that appellants were not entitled to attorney's fees. The court affirmed, holding that from the record it did not appear that the decision on the promotional by-pass was based solely upon the refusal to submit to a polygraph examination and because the commission was the final arbiter of the chief's action, there was no constitutional issue to warrant judicial review. The court also held that because appellants sought and obtained relief under art. 1269(m) and not under the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, they were not entitled to attorney's fees, which were not authorized by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On two separate occasions appellee claimant was injured while at work. The first injury appellant provided workmen's compensation benefits and the second injury the trial court awarded appellee full compensation after a jury concluded the prior compensable general injury contributed 65 percent to appellee's incapacity. Appellant challenged the trial court's award contending that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8306 &sect; 12c as amended in 1971 did not make it liable for all compensation provided for the combined incapacity produced by multiple compensable general injuries. The court found that the plain language of the statute should have been considered and that such language demonstrated the intent of the legislature was for appellant to have been liable for appellee's full compensable injury regardless of prior injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court finding that appellant insurance association was liable to appellee claimant for the full compensable injury because the 1971 statute did not change the legislative intent that appellant should be liable for appellee's full compensable injury regardless of prior injury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tenant withheld rent after a dispute with appellee landlord. Appellee landlord, prior to obtaining an adjudication of the dispute, obtained a distress warrant pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5239 (1962), and seized appellants' business property. Appellant filed a counterclaim for injunctive relief and damages against appellees, contending that the distress warrant statute was unconstitutional. The trial court denied appellant's application for injunctive relief. In reversing the order and remanding the case, the court held that art. 5239 was unconstitutional because it failed to meet the standards of minimal due process as required by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court applied a three-prong test to determine the statute's constitutionality. The court found that the first variable was satisfied because only a judge could issue the warrant. The second variable was deficient because the statute and Tex. R. Civ. P. 610 did not provide for an affidavit that went beyond mere conclusory allegations or which clearly set forth facts that entitled a creditor to his relief. The third variable also was deficient because there were no provisions for an immediate hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county commissioners court reformed the boundaries of the justice of the peace and constable precincts in the county.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In assessing a franchise tax, appellee state comptroller applied the allocation formula in Tex. Tax.-Gen. Code Ann. art. 12.01(a). Appellant company proposed an alternative formulae under Tex. Tax.-Gen. Code Ann. art. 12.02(2), which appellee refused. Appellant brought an action for a refund and the trial court rendered judgment for appellee. Appellant sought review and argued that the art. 12.01(a) formula over-assessed the extent of its business activity in Texas and that appellee improperly rejected appellant's proposed alternative formulae. The court affirmed and ruled that appellant had the burden of demonstrating the unfairness of the art. 12.01(a) formula, and that, if the burden was discharged, then appellee could have permitted other allocation methods if reasonable, but appellee was not required to grant relief just because the alternate formulae would have produced a lesser tax. The court found that appellant's business structure resulted in omission of its subsidiaries' gross receipts from foreign income, thereby increasing the proportion of income attributable to Texas, but the court ruled that this was due to business decisions, not the allocation formula.</SPAN></P>

Appellee alleged non-compliance with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5421c-12, grossly inadequate consideration, and an unconstitutional donation of public property. At the close of all the evidence, the trial court withdrew the case from the jury and granted appellee's motion for instructed verdict based on the application of art. 5421c-12. The trial court voided the entire transaction by a judgment that all deeds in the exchange transaction were nullified, cancelled, set aside and declared wholly void. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the public notice requirement of art. 5421c-12 was applicable to the exchange of property; the exchange of property was a void act for failure to comply with the public notice requirements for sale of public property; the void act could not be cured by a ratifying city resolution; and the requirements to specifically plead estoppel and then prove the element of reliance by appellants had not been met.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant fireman took a promotional examination for assistant fire chief and tied with another applicant. Efficiency ratings were used to break the tie pursuant to a regulation of the Firemen's and Policemen's Civil Service Commission of San Antonio, which resulted in appellant being ranked after the other applicant. Appellant brought suit to declare the regulation invalid and enjoin the placement of the other applicant's name ahead of his. The trial court dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The court on appeal affirmed. No provision existed in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann art. 1269m for appeal with regard to decisions of the commission in this situation. An inherent right of appeal from an administrative body created by an act silent on the question of appeal should be recognized by the courts only when the administrative action complained of violates a constitutional provision. The commission was not guilty of fraud or bad faith, and nothing in the record to indicated that the commission acted arbitrarily or capriciously.

Appellant argued that the trial court erred in relying on the declaration in the Municipal Airports Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 46d-15(1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor challenged summary judgment in favor of appellee city in an action for personal injuries sustained when appellant, then 16 years of age, fell from a beacon tower in the course of his employment with a lessee of appellee's municipal airport. Appellant was disassembling the beacon from the tower when the tower toppled from its moorings. After receiving worker's compensation benefits from his employer's carrier, appellant brought suit against appellee, a Home Rule city, to recover damages. The trial court granted summary judgment based on appellee's plea of sovereign or governmental immunity. Appellant argued that the courts were not bound by the legislative declaration in the Municipal Airports Act (MAA), Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 46d-15(1969), that municipal activities in connection with airports were governmental functions. Appellant also argued that the MAA did not apply to leased airport premises. Holding it was bound by binding precedent as to the constitutionality of the statute, the appellate court disagreed and affirmed the judgment because nothing in the MAA implied that appellee lost its sovereign immunity by leasing the airport to another.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment order in favor of appellee city was affirmed because the acts and omissions that appellant charged appellee were all classified as &quot;governmental&quot; by the statute. The court held that binding precedent precluded any judicial order that thwarted the plain legislative intent by destroying appellee's immunity simply because it was a lessor and not an operator of the airport.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied recovery to appellant for delinquent rent and damages to the rental property. Appellant argued there were insufficient facts to support the court's findings.

Appellant took possession of appellee's personal property when temporary sublessee did not pay rent and left. The appellant used some of it in his business without permission, did not protect the property from damage or wear and tear, and when tendered the rent money by appellee, charged additional money simply because appellee had consulted an attorney. Appellant also demanded permanent possession of some of the property as a condition of returning the rest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees sued appellant for the proceeds from the sale of stock and for the recovery of money that was spent by appellees for the partial discharge of a promissory note. The trial court entered judgment for appellees and appellant sought review. Appellant contended that the trial court erred when it refused to admit a memorandum indicating the percentage of his fee on one of the bonds, and that the percentage of appellant's fee was factually and legally insufficient. Appellant also asserted that he did not receive payment for the stock because part of the consideration that he received was in the form of unpaid notes. Appellant further claimed that the trial court erred by not reducing the principal amount owed to appellees by the offsets, and by finding that appellee's garnishment was not wrongful. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that any error in excluding the memorandum supporting appellant's fees was harmless. Witness testimony interpreted the language of the memorandum and excluding the document itself was not reasonably calculated to cause, and probably did not cause an improper judgment. The court also overruled appellant's remaining points of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant sought a mixed beverage permit for premises that had been located in a &quot;dry&quot; justice precinct prior to the 1919 prohibition amendment to the Texas Constitution and its 1935 repeal. A county-wide election approved the sale of alcohol in the county. The area later was shifted to another precinct. Appellee, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, denied the application because local officials refused to certify that the premises were in a &quot;wet&quot; area. The trial court sustained the denial and the court affirmed and held that the officials were correct because nothing in either Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 20 (1935) or in the statutes enacted pursuant to that amendment, permitted the will of the voters in a precinct to be overridden by a vote of the county as a whole. An area remained dry, although detached from the dry precinct and added to a wet precinct, because Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 20(c) (1970) used &quot;area&quot; instead of &quot;political subdivision.&quot; The ruling did not deny equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the commissioners' court could protect all interested persons by drawing a new election line approximating the original boundaries of the precinct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Husband and wife were the original subdividers and developers of a land addition and sold 22 lots before appellant developer bought the remaining 63 lots.

Appellee civic club was granted a temporary injunction that enjoined appellants from selling lots smaller than those shown on the recorded plat of the subdivision and from building any improvements on the lots without prior approval of appellee's architectural committee. Appellant sought review, and the court reversed and rendered the trial court's order granting the temporary injunction as to the size of the lots, and affirmed the order as to the architectural committee's approval. The court found no facts in the record that demonstrated a general plan for developing the addition into lots of a minimum width. However, the court found that husband and wife had expressly reserved the privilege of approving plans and specifications, and appellees demonstrated probable injury justifying the injunction through testimony of appellant's president that he refused to submit plans to appellee's architectural committee for approval.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers filed a suit against appellee school district to enjoin appellee from collecting school district taxes based upon its approved tax rolls on the grounds that appellee adopted a defective plan of taxation and used a valuation system that was void under Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The lower court found in favor of appellees. On appeal, the court held that appellee used an arbitrary taxation plan because appellee valued all real estate at $ 50 per acre although the market value of the real estate in the area varied and after a thorough discussion of excluding all personal property from assessment, only that property which was rendered was included. However, the court also held that as a prerequisite to obtaining injunctive relief against appellee's plan, appellant did not prove that its taxes were excessive or substantially higher because of appellee's omission of taxable property or because of appellee's failure to assess taxable property at its market value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment denying appellant taxpayers' request for injunctive relief from appellee school district's tax plan was affirmed on the grounds that although appellee's plan was arbitrary in assessing all real estate at the same value and omitting personal property from assessment, appellant did not prove it suffered a substantial injury as the result of appellee's plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, Texas Savings and Loan Commissioner and related parties, adopted a regulation that prohibited savings associations from giving premiums or other items of value as attractions for opening, adding to, or maintaining minimum balances in, savings accounts. The court affirmed the denial of a temporary injunction against the adoption of the regulation as sought by appellants, various associations that benefited from gift giving programs. The court reviewed the testimony, which indicated that the gift giving had become competitive among institutions, and that the regulation was constitutional and a valid exercise of authority. Appellants had not established their probable right to recover under the injunction because the order promulgating the regulation was supported by substantial evidence. The court found that the regulation was within appellee commissioner's rule-making authority under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 342-114 and the court did not disturb the exercise of the police power, because it did not appear that the regulation was unnecessary and unreasonable.

The only evidence linking defendant to the armed robbery was that of the testimony of the accomplice witness, who was in fact found by the trial court to be an accomplice witness. The trial court also found as a fact that there was no evidence which corroborated the testimony of the accomplice witness, and the trial court found as a matter of law that corroboration of the accomplice's testimony was not required in order to adjudicate a child guilty of having engaged in delinquent conduct. Defendant argued that he could not be found guilty with uncorroborated accomplice testimony in view of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.14. The court affirmed the trial court because in incorporating essential and fundamental due process rights into the Texas juvenile law, the legislature did not include a provision such as art. 38.14.

Appellant was advised by appellee city's attorney of the results of a non-response. Other appellees filed claims for tax delinquencies against appellant. The trial court granted a default judgment for all appellees, governmental taxing authorities, and the court affirmed. The court found that because the citation was properly served, appellant knew the consequences of a non-response, and appellant failed to exercise diligence in the defense of the action, the denial of appellant's motion for new trial was proper. Also, appellant had no meritorious defense because collection of taxes on personal property temporarily removed from the taxing authority's location was proper. Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7153. Appellant's motion waived the citation's defects. Further, one citation was sufficient for all appellees to obtain a judgment under Tex. R. Civ. P. 2, 117a, and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, art.

Appellants charged appellees' drugstores with violating Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The trial court entered a temporary injunction, enjoining appellants from revoking or cancelling appellees' permits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant debtors sought review of the judgment of the 107th District Court, Cameron County (Texas), which rendered a verdict for appellee creditor in a suit to set aside a trustee's sale and to remove the trustee's deed as a cloud on appellants' title.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, creditor, foreclosed on and sold at a trustee's sale property on which appellants, debtors, stopped making payments. Appellants filed suit against appellee seeking to set aside the sale on the ground that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3810 (1966) was unconstitutional and that appellant had utilized unconstitutional procedures in affecting the sale. The trial court jury found for appellee, and the court affirmed holding that art. 3810 was not unconstitutional. The court held that the fact that the trustee acted with knowledge of art. 3810 and the deed of trust had terms complying with art. 3810 was not sufficient to establish significant state action or involvement. The court held that appellee simply relied upon the terms of the deed of trust agreement executed by the appellants pursuant to the private right of contract and did not seek to invoke any state machinery to his aid, and thus the procedure challenged involved only private actions arising out of the express written agreements between the parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant natural mother and the natural father, the son of appellee natural paternal grandparents, had two children; the two divorced, and appellees maintained a relationship with the children through their son's visitation rights.

The domestic relations court granted visitation rights to appellees and denied all other relief. The court reversed the judgment, holding that appellees were not &quot;paternal grandparents&quot; of the children within the meaning of &sect; 14.03(d), as appellees' rights terminated once the children were adopted, pursuant to Tex.

The ditch was not located on appellee's property, but rather emptied into a creek five miles upstream from the property.

Following a jury trial, the trial court rendered a judgment which permanently enjoined appellant from enlarging the ditch. The court reversed the judgment, dissolved the permanent injunction, and rendered judgment that appellee take nothing. The court held that appellant's proposed action was not a taking of appellee's land. Further, while appellant did not have the right to appropriate land outside of its boundaries, the court held that appellant did have the right to construct the proposed improvement, even though the construction might cause consequential damage to appellee's land. The court held that the trial court erred in granting the injunction because appellee had an adequate remedy at law in the event that the enlargement actually caused damage.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied injunctive relief and appellant sought review, arguing that his acts were not violations of the Pharmacy Act, and the charges did not afford proper notice of the offenses alleged. The court affirmed and ruled that appellant was given reasonable notice of the nature of the complaints against his conduct, and that, as a professional man engaged in a field of endeavor affecting the public health and well-being, he was charged in law with knowledge that the specific facts set out in the supporting affidavit constituted impermissible conduct authorizing the revocation of his licenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant permit seeker challenged an order of the District Court of Lamar County (Texas), which found that there was substantial evidence to support the ruling of appellee, the state Alcoholic Beverage Commission, denying appellant an application for a private club registration permit and a beverage cartage permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant permit seeker challenged an order of trial court, which affirmed the denial, by appellee, the state Alcoholic Beverage Commission, of permits that would allow appellant to sell alcoholic beverages. Appellee contended that the substantial evidence rule should not have been applied by the district court, that Tex. Penal Code art. 666-11(6) was unconstitutionally vague and over broad, and that there was no evidence justifying the district court's conclusion that appellant would violate the vague standards of Tex. Penal Code art. 666-11(6). The court affirmed, finding that the substantial evidence rule had been properly applied, because Tex. Penal Code art. 666-15e(7a) was unconstitutional in that it provided for conflicting methods of review of an administrative order. Because permits and licenses were privileges rather than property rights, constitutional due process safeguards did not extend to them, and the record contained substantial evidence in the form of testimony that the sale of alcoholic beverages at the proposed location near a junior college and student center would be a detriment to the community to support the reasonableness of appellee's denial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Through a series of resignations and appointments, two factions of individuals claimed control of the school board. Appellants, new school board members, were enjoined from acting in such capacity until further hearings could be held.

The court determined that the injunction case was not brought by an independent school district and that the necessary bond was not posted. The court dissolved the injunction. The court determined that adjudication of the position of office holders was not an appropriate forum and that the parties named in the suit had reassigned. The suit was therefore moot.

Appellant contended that the trial court erred in holding the statute unconstitutional, in declaring null and void the election that approved the expansion of the hospital district, and in entering a permanent injunction against it from assessing or collecting any taxes on the lands and properties of appellees. The court reversed and held that it was unable to point out a specific provision in the state constitution which prohibited the expansion or boundary change of a hospital district that was already created and subject to bonded indebtedness and that such limitation was not clearly implied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee school district ordered a maintenance tax and general obligation bond election.

The trial court upheld the election results authorizing the bonds. The actions were consolidated for disposition. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and denied a motion for rehearing.

Appellant filed a suit to enjoin appellee city and appellee's transportation system operating at an airport from denying appellant's alleged privilege under the railroad commission authority to operate limousine service to and from the airport; the trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did have jurisdiction to determine the authority of an order from the railroad commission, but did not have authority to adjudicate the applicability of regulations and penal ordinances as indispensable parties were not present. The court further decided that issues on appeal regarding the validity of penal ordinances were not to be considered and there was no reversible error by the trial court in granting appellee's motion for summary judgment. Upon appellant's subsequent motion for a rehearing, the court founds no errors warranting a rehearing and overruled the motion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a petition for injunction against appellant motel proprietor, who was providing adult films to room renters. Pursuant to Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4667, appellant was enjoined from commercially exhibiting the obscene films. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed. The court found the exhibition of films, without extra charge, constituted commercial exhibition pursuant to art. 4667 because the exhibition of the films furnished to renters in exchange for room rentals was valuable consideration. The court also found the films were not protected by U.S. Const. amend. I because the films were obscene under contemporary community standards and under the test of &quot;utterly redeeming social value&quot; set out in Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 43.21. Furthermore, the court found the injunction was not a prior restraint of expression because of the specific acts proven, the specificity of the order, and the stipulations and procedures contained in the order. Finally, the court found the injunction was not an invasion of appellant's privacy because the protected privacy of the renters had not given rise to a corollary right to furnish obscene films for the renters' viewing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizen brought suit against appellees, town and town officials, alleging that an order declaring appellee town incorporated was null and void. After appellees' plea in abatement was overruled, they answered with special exceptions, citing Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 974d-12, 974d-17. The trial court held that the statutes validated the incorporation and rendered a judgment that appellant take nothing. On appeal, the court held that the challenge maintained appellant was required to be brought by quo warranto proceedings in the name of the state. In quo warranto cases where the state was an indispensable party, as here, the absence of that indispensable party was a reversible error of which the court could take judicial notice. As a quo warranto proceeding was the sole and exclusive remedy for the alleged grievance, the validity of the incorporation could not be questioned in the collateral proceedings. Thus, the court reversed and dismissed the case.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act (Act), 28 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2201 and 2202, was not applicable because a federal constitutional right was not implicated and the Act could not be used to enlarge the authority of a state court acting under a state statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the request and appellants sought review, arguing that appellee had no authority to purchase the clinic with bond money. The court dispensed of this point by noting that no tax or bond money was used to purchase the clinic. Appellants also contended that the city lacked authority to purchase the clinic under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4494h. Although the court agreed that the clinic did not meet the definition of a hospital under article 4494h, it held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4478 clearly gave appellee the authority to establish any medical or other health facilities. Finally, appellants contended that the statutory authority to lease the medical facility was unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 52. The court held that the plenary power of the legislature to authorize the counties to provide for the care and treatment of the sick was not prohibited by &sect; 52.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Texas Optometry Board, challenged a judgment of a Dallas County, (Texas) trial court that set aside the appellant's orders suspending the advertising permits of appellee vision center and appellee realty corporation, and declared part of the Texas Optometry Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4552, &sect;&sect; 5.09 and 5.10 (Supp. 1969) unconstitutional as it allegedly discriminated against opticians.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Texas Optometry Board entered orders suspending advertising permits of the appellees, a vision center and a realty corporation, after finding the appellees had violated the Texas Optometry Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4552, &sect; 5.10(e),(f),(j), and (k) (Supp. 1969). Appellees challenged the orders in the trial court where the trial court set aside the appellant's orders suspending the advertising permits of the appellees because of their finding that &sect; 5.10 of the Texas Optometry Act was unconstitutional in that it discriminated against opticians in favor of optometrists. Appellant then sought review. The court noted that a law duly enacted was presumed to be valid and examined &sect; 5.09 and &sect; 5.10 to determine if there was an unreasonable classification or discrimination. The court held that advertising of optical appliances by dispensing opticians was related to public health and could be restricted or even abolished by the state under its police power. The court found that optometrists and dispensing opticians affected the well-being of Texas citizens, and were subject to the state police power. The trial court judgment was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant credit corporation challenged the imposition of civil penalties of $ 35,000 for the knowing violation of an injunction which enjoined appellant from carrying on deceptive practices, under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5069, &sect; 10,01 et seq. (1971), that consisted of the mailing and distribution to debtors of certain forms. The court reversed the judgment. The court rejected appellant's contention the injunction judgment was void for want of jurisdiction. The court held that appellant participated in the injunction proceeding as a real party and was bound by the injunction. The court found, however, that serious issues of fact were raised as to whether the injunction had been knowingly violated as all forms had been drastically changed so as to comply with the injunction and did not threaten debtors with any illegal penalty, as Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5069, &sect; 11.02(f) (1973) expressly recognized the right of a debt collector to threaten to institute civil proceedings to collect a debt. The court stated that appellant was entitled to have the issues resolved by a jury as the action was not a contempt hearing, but an action for civil penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, spouse of decedent firefighter and parent of minor children, challenged a ruling of the 162nd District Court of Dallas County (Texas) that ruled in favor of appellee state retirement system, alleging the trial court erred in finding that the enactment of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5923b operated to disqualify her children from receiving survivor's benefits after the age of 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6228f, the minor children of appellant were awarded survivor's benefits until the age of 21 upon the death of their father and appellant's spouse, a firefighter. The trial court then held that the children were no longer entitled to benefits beyond the age of 18 due to the subsequent enactment of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5923b, which changed the definition of a &quot;minor&quot; from one being under the age of 21 to one being under 18. Appellant then sought review, alleging the trial court erroneously applied art. 5923b to retroactively take away the children's benefits to which the children had a vested right, in violation of Tex. Const. art I, &sect; 10. Upon review, the court affirmed. It held that the children acquired no vested right in the financial assistance funds provided under art. 6228f, but only acquired the right to participate in the fund subject to the continuing control of the legislature. As such, the legislature effectively changed the age at which the benefits would terminate for those receiving financial assistance, and application of such change to appellant's children was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision holding that the children of appellant were not entitled to survivor's benefits after the age of 18 was affirmed because the children had no vested right to the benefits until the age of 21, and the legislature had the right to subsequently enact a statute that operated to terminate the benefits to the children when they reached the age of 18.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was a suit brought by the Texas Water Well Drillers Board in the name of the State of Texas under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7621e. Trial was by jury, and judgment was rendered for the state upon the verdict. Defendant had a point of error that the Water Well Drillers Act was unconstitutional because it was an invalid delegation of legislative authority in that it did not set forth guidelines or standards for the Board to follow in licensing and regulating water well drillers. The court held that the Water Well Drillers Act was sufficiently complete and comprehensive in itself and did no more than delegate to the administrative agency the authority to establish rules, regulations, and minimum standards to reasonably carry out the expressed purpose of the Act. That expressed purpose was to allow only those with the necessary knowledge of drilling, completion, and plugging methods and techniques and of ground formations to go into the business of drilling water in Texas. The avoidance of pollution of fresh water was sufficient purpose in itself. There was no suggestion by anyone that the rules adopted by the Board allowed the Board to arbitrarily grant or deny a permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling of the trial court which ruled in favor of the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state board of public accountancy sought review of judgment in favor of appellee accounting company under the Public Accountancy Act of 1945, Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 41a, based on the argument the lower court erroneously found the statute unconstitutional. The court agreed and reversed, concluding the statute did not impermissibly discriminate by requiring those holding themselves out as accountants to comply with the act's permit requirements. The court explained accounting was a highly skilled profession affecting the public that the state was entitled to regulate in the exercise of its police power. The court further concluded the statute was constitutional and did not amount to an unwarranted regulation of private business. The court noted no equal protection infringement occurred when the classification based on holding oneself out as an accountant was rationally related to the legitimate state objective of imposing licensing requirements upon the skilled profession to protect the public and prohibiting unlicensed practitioners from holding themselves out as accountants to the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, county and county officials, sought review of the order of the District Court of Culberson County (Texas), declaring that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1645a-13, which abolished the office of the county auditor of Culberson County, was unconstitutional because it was local or special legislation applying only to Culberson County in violation of the provisions of Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1645a-13 was enacted to abolish the office of the county auditor of Culberson County. Appellees, the present county auditor and interested taxpayers, filed suit against appellants, county and county officials, alleging that art. 1645a-13 was unconstitutional because it was local or special legislation. The trial court entered a judgment declaring that art. 1645a-13 was unconstitutional because it was a local law that was violative of Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 56. Appellants sought review. The court affirmed because Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 56 denied the legislature the right to pass any special, private, or local law, and art. 1645a-13 was such a local and special law. The law was a local law because, by its express terms, it affected only Culberson County, it could never extend to any other county or be applicable statewide because of the limiting language and only the voters of Culberson County could enact it. Moreover, the law designated a particular city or county by name, and its operation was limited to that county. Thus, the judgment of the trial court was proper, and it was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant alleged that inadmissible evidence was admitted before the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving a tip from an informant, police picked up appellant juvenile at a friend's house, advised him of his constitutional rights by administering a Miranda warning, and took him to the police station. Enroute to the station the officer interrogated appellant and he made an oral statement incriminating himself and revealing that the starter's pistol and bank bag used in the robbery were at his friend's house. Appellant also made a written statement. Appellant at no time requested or received the assistance or consent of an attorney. Appellant was found to have engaged in delinquent behaviour and placed on probation. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding appellant's written statement and oral waiver of his constitutional right to remain silent were inadmissible where Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 51.09(1), required concurrence of appellant's attorney in appellant's waiver of his constitutional right to remain silent. The court held the pistol and bank bag were inadmissible where they were illegally obtained without the sanction of a valid waiver. The court held, in the event there were further proceedings on remand, the juvenile proceedings were civil adjudications.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision finding appellant juvenile had engaged in delinquent conduct and placing appellant on probation.

The court held evidence obtained as a result of the invalid waiver was inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

A trial court committed appellant to the care, custody, and control of the Texas Youth Council. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, rejecting the contention that Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 54.04(b) deprived a child of a basic constitutional right. The court found that there was no complaint that appellant was not accorded due process in his adjudication hearing. The court determined that in a disposition hearing, there was good reason to give the judge the latitude afforded by &sect; 54.04(b) to consider all factors in deciding what disposition to make. Any possible danger to the child was removed by the requirement that the trial court provide the attorney for the child with all written matter to be considered by the trial court in disposition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Challenging the dismissal of their suit for lack of jurisdiction, appellants argued that it was not contesting election, but seeking to enjoin appellee water district's bond sale authorized by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7880, &sect; 34. The court agreed, finding that the relief sought was injunctive and the primary purpose of the action was to have appellee's bonds declared void and enjoin their sale. The court found that a party interested in questioning validity could file suit if the filing was prior to bond registration by the comptroller. However, appellants did not exercise reasonable diligence, but allowed 38 months to elapse, so the court held that they were precluded from taking a no election defense. Appellants also alleged that even though appellee had never owned any public works requiring maintenance, it had levied a maintenance and bond tax every year since 1960, and that it should be enjoined from collecting those taxes and render an accounting of all tax funds collected during its existence. The court held that the trial court had jurisdiction of that issue and erred in not severing the issues. The judgment was affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.</SPAN></P>

A no election defense was precluded, and the court erred in not severing the issues.</SPAN></P>

The court held that plaintiffs failed to show that the plan would have discriminated against them by deliberately assessing their property at a greater percentage of its true value than the percentage assessed for other properties subject to the tax. The court also held that the question of temporary injunctive relief was not rendered moot by the action of the defendants in putting the tax plan into effect and accepting payments from other taxpayers, and that the tax assessment in question was not void because of lack of authority of the taxing officials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff creditor acquired two notes signed by defendant debtors, a corporation and its owner. Plaintiff brought suit on the note, and the trial court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction over defendants, both California citizens. Plaintiff appealed the decision, and the court held that due process required only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he was not present within Texas, he must have had certain minimum contacts with Texas such that the maintenance of the suit did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. The court noted that both notes were payable in Texas, one of them was signed in Texas; and discussions leading up to their execution were held in Texas.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner sought to recover damages from appellee Texas Turnpike Authority for breach of covenant. In 1956 appellee condemned real property later acquired by appellant, and contractually agreed that no access road to the toll road or turnpike project would be constructed, maintained, operated or permitted from lands and streets adjoining the land condemned. In 1967, the need for an access road was determined, and appellee compensated appellant for acquisition of the necessary land. Appellant then demanded additional compensation based upon the 1956 covenant. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, and appellant challenged the order. The court held that the summary judgment was appropriate because the 1956 agreement was void and ineffective. The court noted that the legislative power vested in municipal bodies was something that could not be bartered away in such manner as to prevent them from performing their public functions. The court held that the agreement clearly constituted an attempt on the part of appellee in 1956 to contract away a governmental function and as such it went directly in the face of established law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, husband and wife, filed a writ of habeas corpus against appellee, the county welfare unit, seeking to recover custody of their children. Appellants sought to collaterally attack and to have declared void a prior judgment rendered by a domestic relations court that had decreed the children to be dependent and neglected children, had terminated appellants' parental rights, and had awarded custody of the children to appellee. The relief was denied and appellants challenged the decision. Appellants argued that the dependency decree was void because Tex. Const. art. 5, &sect; 8 vested exclusive jurisdiction in district courts, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2338-15a was unconstitutional, and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2338-1, &sect; 24-A provided that the district court only had original jurisdiction of dependent and neglected child cases. The court held that, by enactment of art. 2338-15a, part of art. 2338-1, &sect; 24-A that provided that only district courts would have jurisdiction to try dependent and neglected child cases was repealed so that the domestic relations court did have jurisdiction to try the case and its judgment was not invalid.

After consideration, this court affirmed the trial court's judgment holding that no state official had to be a party to the proceedings, appellant waived his right to complaint about the judgment of disbarment and the admission of certain evidence, and the excluded evidence complained of by appellant was inadmissible as hearsay.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statute was valid, and that the six months requirement was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary. Further, the state was not required to show a compelling state interest, but only that the residency distinction in the statute bore a reasonable relation to the interests the state sought to protect. The court determined that there were sound reasons for the requirement, including that a litigant should not be permitted shop for a favorable forum, that hardship could result to a spouse and children remaining in a former residence if compelled to travel to the new county residence for hearings and trial, and that evidence could become unavailable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a county, its district clerk, and the clerk's surety, sought relief from the trial court's summary judgment that appellee claimants were entitled to recover from appellant county all but $ 25 of the interest that had been earned on certain interpleader funds awarded in a separate case to appellees. The court reversed the summary judgment because appellees had not established in their summary judgment materials that all of the interpleader funds had been kept in an interest bearing account or that $ 25 was a sum reasonably related to the value of the county's services in safeguarding and investing the interpleader funds. The court noted, however, that in any trial on the merits, appellant county would have the burden of establishing the reasonable value of its services. Regarding the summary judgment entered in favor of appellant district clerk and against appellants for recovery of the disputed interest, the court affirmed because appellant district clerk had treated the interpleader funds appropriately and there was no basis for imposing personal liability upon the district clerk.</SPAN></P>

As for the second judgment, appellant clerk had no personal liability for the disputed interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant student sought a declaratory judgment that he was a resident of Texas and recovery of tuition paid as a non-resident. Appellees university and registrar entered a plea to the jurisdiction and in abatement, alleging that appellant was part of a federal class action on the same issues, and claiming sovereign immunity. Granting their plea, the trial court dismissed the case. On appeal, the court found that although the pending federal action did not abate the state court action, the applicable declaratory judgment law supported the trial court's discretion to refuse to entertain jurisdiction. While the court affirmed the dismissal of appellant's prayer for declaratory, it reversed and remanded appellant's cause for recovery of money paid. Finding that it was a cause severable from the declaratory relief action, the court rejected appellee's sovereign immunity defense because appellant alleged appellee registrar was acting beyond his legal authority and if the excessive tuition was illegally extracted, it would amount to a taking of private property.</SPAN></P>

He filed suit to enjoin the enforcement of a school regulation that prohibited married students from participating in extra-curricular activities including football.

The court held that if a school district provided an athletic program, it must do so in a manner not calculated to discriminate against a class of individuals who will be treated differently from the remainder of the students unless the school district shows that such a rule was a necessary restraint to promote a compelling state interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient and her husband brought a medical malpractice suit against defendant doctor for defendant's negligent failure to discharge his duty of administering proper medical treatment which would have enabled plaintiff to make a decision about abortive action. Provisions of Texas law prohibited abortion prior to plaintiff's pregnancy, Tex. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 1191- 1196 (invalidated 1973). The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant and plaintiffs appealed. Plaintiffs argued that the action, or omission to act by making the discovery and disclosure of the illness of plaintiff's unborn child, so that plaintiff could have had an opportunity to timely resort to curative measures of abortion, was not because of defendant's reliance upon the state of Texas law apparently in force at the time. The evidence supported plaintiff's contention that defendant negligently failed to make discovery and/or neglected or failed to make disclosure to the plaintiff, however, the court affirmed the judgment and held that defendant was entitled to base his defense on an invalid statute apparently in effect, although his conduct in conformity therewith was not in reliance on it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner attorney sought mandamus relief of a judgment from the 66th Judicial District Court of Hill County (Texas), which granted the state bar's motion to change venue under Tex. R. Civ. P. 257 in a disbarment action brought pursuant to Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 320a-1, &sect;&sect; 5, 6. Respondent judge granted the motion upon an allegation that the state bar would not obtain a fair trial in the county of petitioner's residence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the state bar brought an action for disbarment against petitioner attorney, the county became polarized on the issue of petitioner's disbarment. The state bar filed a motion to change venue, claiming a fair and impartial trial could not be had in the county, and respondent judge granted the motion. In response, petitioner sought a writ of mandamus, and the court granted mandamus relief. The court found the change of venue provision under Tex. R. Civ. P. 257 was controlled by Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 320a-1, &sect;&sect; 5, 6, which required petitioner's disbarment action to be instituted in the county of petitioner's residence. Furthermore, the court found the requirements of art. 320a-1, &sect; 6 were not unconstitutional as an unwarranted legislative encroachment upon the power of the courts to assure all litigants a fair and impartial trial because a fair trial, under the circumstances, had meant one which took place in the county of petitioner's residence. Finally, the court found that art. 320a-1, &sect;&sect; 5, 6 could not be invalidated based on the state bar's argument that the sections were unfair, unjust, and unwise because invalidation for these reasons was a legislative function.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted mandamus relief of a judgment granting the state bar's motion to change venue because the disbarment statutes, which provided for venue in petitioner attorney's county of residence, controlled over the change of venue statute, the disbarment statutes' venue provisions had not encroached on the judiciary's power to assure an impartial trial, and the disbarment statutes could not be invalidated for allegations of unfairness.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4477-5, &sect; 3.27(a) (1973). The court granted the injunction, and the court affirmed the order. Defendant, on appeal, argued that the construction of the proposed plant did not fall under the provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The court held that the testimony at the temporary injunction hearing supported plaintiffs' contentions that there was a practical possibility that the plant would emit odor-causing pollutants. The court further held that all that was required for the issuance of the permit was a practical possibility that the plant would emit odor causing pollutants and that to require more would have been inconsistent with the legislative intent in the enactment of art. 4477-5.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the temporary injunction.

The court found that appellees had the right to prevent the prohibited sales and that the trial court had broad discretion to make a finding of probable injury. Appellant also argued that the trial court erred in refusing to admit certain testimony and in admitting evidence of specific violations of the statute where the allegations of the complaint were general.

Appellants contended that they were improperly denied a mistrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee electric cooperative took an easement by condemnation across appellant landowners' property in order to erect transmission lines. Appellants filed a temporary injunction action against appellee but it was not acted upon. The trial court ruled in appellee's favor. The court affirmed. The jury was unable to decide a special issue of whether appellee had acted arbitrarily. The court held that appellants' objection to the trial judge's decision to decide that special issue was too vague to have preserved the issue for appeal. Refusal to admit aerial pictures into evidence was harmless error because appellants did not perfect a no evidence point, and the pictures would not clearly have led to another conclusion. Refusal to admit testimony on the effect of a statute that governs activities allowed in the area of the lines was not error because it related to damages issue, which was not plead as error. The court held that appellants did not verify their temporary injunction application or pursue it prior to the construction of the lines, thus they could not pursue error on that ground. Because the element of imminent injury was absent, injunctive relief could not be granted.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 7589a resulting from the diversion of water from defendant developer's land onto plaintiffs' land. The jury found for defendants, finding that they had caused permanent damage to plaintiffs' land but that the land was worth the same amount both before and after the diversion. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, finding that the failure to award damages was contrary to the great weight of the evidence. Testimony from both parties showed land values higher than that found by the trial court and damage values of at least a certain amount. The court further found that the jury instructions were ambiguous because the trial court referred to the &quot;property in question&quot; rather than specifying the entire tract, the acres to be developed by plaintiffs, or the acre where the water flowed. Finally, the court overturned the jury's finding that defendant city's actions were reasonable in allowing the diversion, holding that the verdict, while based on a valid legal defense to an intentional diversion action, was manifestly unjust under the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that even if the statute were unconstitutionally broad, appellant was not entitled to injunctive relief because he had an adequate remedy at law. The court held that where a state criminal proceeding, based on an allegedly unconstitutional state statute, was pending, the opportunity for appellant to present, and obtain an adjudication of, his asserted constitutional rights afforded him an adequate remedy, because it was as speedy, and as practical and efficient, as the proposed equitable remedy, at least in the absence of allegation and proof of bad faith enforcement of the challenged statute and harassment by appellees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee power company brought suit against appellant operators for failing to pay for electricity service provided to appellant's two apartment buildings. The trial court awarded damages to appellee against all appellants for one apartment building and against all appellants save one for the other. On review, appellant's raised the sole complaint that the trial court erred in awarding attorney's fees to appellees under the provisions of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2226. The court held that, as amended, article 2226 allowed the trial court to award attorney's fees to appellee in its suit to recover for service rendered to appellants. Appellants next contended that the amended version of article 2226 violated Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 for being misleading. The court responded that Article III, &sect; 35 merely required that each bill contain one subject, expressed in the bill's title. The court held that article 2226 satisfied those requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed the order from the District Court of Dallas County (Texas) granting defendant's motion for summary judgment after finding that Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's son was injured while riding as a guest in a vehicle driven by defendant. Plaintiff sued defendant to recover the medical expenses incurred for plaintiff's son's treatment. The parties stipulated that defendant was not guilty of gross negligence. Defendant contended that he was entitled to summary judgment because the guest statute,&nbsp;Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701b, precluded plaintiff's recovery. The lower court agreed and granted defendant's motion. Plaintiff appealed that ruling. Plaintiff contended that the cause of action for his son's medical expenses was his own, rather than his son's, and that it was not within the literal language of the statute because he was not defendant's guest. Thus, plaintiff argued his recovery was based on ordinary negligence, although the statute clearly denied recovery to his son. The court disagreed with plaintiff. The court held that the statute applied to plaintiff's claim. Further, the court concluded that plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the classification of automobile guests in the statute was either so arbitrarily under-inclusive or so arbitrarily over-inclusive as to constitute invidious discrimination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order granting defendant's motion for summary judgment because the state's guest statute barred plaintiff's claim, as well as plaintiff's son's claims, against defendant, and the guest statute did not deprive automobile guests equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a 16-year-old driver, was convicted of two moving traffic violations, for which he paid fines, and his driver's license was suspended for three months. On appeal, the court affirmed the order of suspension, and held that appellant was not denied due process because he was not represented by a lawyer when he was convicted for the two violations, and noted that the U.S. Supreme Court had not yet required a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel at a trial of an offense punishable by fine only. Secondly, the court held that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6687(b), &sect; 22(b)10, was not unconstitutional for denying to minors equal protection of the law. The statute provided that a provisional driver's license, issued according to art. 6687b, &sect; 11A, to drivers under 21, could be suspended if the holder were convicted of two or more moving violations of the traffic laws in a 12-month period. For other drivers, art. 6687(b), &sect; 22(b)4, required four or more convictions for suspension.

Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 46(e), and could be removed if declared a nuisance. The court found that there was never any attempt to declare the power line a nuisance. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment on the grounds that appellants actually knew and appreciated the specific danger of allowing their aircraft to come into contact with appellee's wires, appellee's wires were visible, open and obvious as a matter of law to appellants, and appellants assumed the specific risk of allowing their aircraft to come into contact with appellee's wires.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant butane company appealed from a judgment of the County Court at Law No. 2 of Nueces County (Texas) insofar as it granted summary judgment on plaintiff fuel company's claim for a reasonable attorney's fee under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2226, as well as on its claim for moneys owed on a sworn account plus. Defendant claimed that plaintiff did not satisfy the statutory requirements, and that the statute violated the antitrust laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff fuel company sued defendant butane company on a sworn account, and sought a reasonable attorney's fee under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2226. Plaintiff alleged that the 30 days presentment required by the statute was made, but did not prove that presentment had been made or that 30 days had elapsed since presentment. The court reversed summary judgment on plaintiff's claim for attorney's fees, and remanded. Since the statutory provision governing attorney's fees was penal, it had to be strictly construed. The evidence was insufficient to support the award of attorney's fees under the statute because there was no proof that plaintiff had presented the claim to defendant for payment, and there was no proof that the amount of the fee claimed was reasonable. However, the statutory presumption that an attorney's fee consistent with the bar association minimum fee schedule was reasonable did not violate the due process and equal protection clauses of the constitution, U.S. Const. amend. V and XIV or the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1. The minimum fee schedule, and its application to determine the reasonableness of the fee claimed, was not mandatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employers sought review of an order sustaining appellee employment commission's plea of privilege. They alleged that appellee erroneously ruled that certain persons were in their employment, making them liable for certain taxes under the Texas Unemployment Compensation Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art 5221b--4(i). They claimed that since the right of appeal was vital to constitutionality, and the only statutory jurisdiction for appeal was vested in courts of the county of appellants' residence, the plea of privilege should have been overruled, and that if the statute allowed an employee to appeal in the county of his residence an employer required to go to Travis County was denied equal protection. The court affirmed, concluding that the legislature intended to place the venue of any suits involving such taxes in Travis County. Likewise it found that the phrase &quot;party aggrieved&quot; in the statute referred to claimants for unemployment benefits, employers, or any other individual adversely affected by appellee's decision in determining whether or not a claimant was entitled to benefits. There was therefore no discrimination affecting the constitutionality of the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants brought a breach of contract and fraud suit against appellee foreign corporation and individual. Appellees filed a special appearance contesting the trial court's jurisdiction. The trial court found that it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the case. On review, appellants asserted that appellees submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the court by appearing before the court. The court reversed and remanded the case for a trial. According to the court, Tex. R. Civ. P. 120a prescribed how a special appearance might be made. The court held that a special appearance shall be made by sworn motion filed prior to plea of privilege or any other plea, pleading or motion. The court stated that pursuant to rule 120a every appearance, prior to judgment, not in compliance with the rule was a general appearance. The court held that defendant seeking to make a special appearance to challenge jurisdiction must strictly follow rule 120a to avoid making a general appearance. The court found that appellee foreign corporation and individual failed to comply with the mandates of the rule, thus, their appearance constituted a general appearance giving the court jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed. It held that the trial judge's preliminary and final injunctive orders were improper, inasmuch as plaintiffs had an adequate remedy at law via an application for a writ of quo warranto. Plaintiffs neither alleged nor proved that they could not have established the validity of their proxies in a quo warranto proceeding after completion of the election, or that they could not have obtained full relief in such a proceeding by judgment declaring the correct result of the election and ousting any persons unlawfully holding the office of directors of the corporation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee organization filed an application for a private club exemption certificate permit from appellant state requesting that it be exempt from property tax. Appellant denied the application on the grounds that appellee was not exempt from taxation under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 7150 on the basis that it was a fraternal or veterans organization. The trial court set aside the ruling of appellant. Appellant sought review arguing the evidence did not support a property tax exemption under art. 7150. The court reversed the trial court's judgment finding that appellant's decision denying tax exemption was reasonably supported by substantial evidence presented to the trial court and that appellant did not arbitrary or capriciously deny appellee's application for an exemption certificate permit. The court found that the use of appellee's buildings for social and fraternal purposes indicated that appellee was neither organized nor operated exclusively for purposes of public charity.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, appellant argued that it was an irrigation contractor, was a lump sum contractor and a consumer of tangible personal property under &sect; 20.01(T), and was in the business of selling a product that was exclusively used or employed on farms or ranches, and, therefore, exempt from taxation. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, concluding that the trial court correctly held that appellant was a lump sum contractor and a consumer of the tangible personal property, which it purchased and incorporated into the irrigation ditches. The court also found that appellant was the consumer of the tangible personal property which it purchased and used in the construction of the irrigation ditches, but did not incorporate therein. The court held that appellant owed sales taxes on both types of purchases under the code, because it purchased the tangible personal property for its own use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed because appellant irrigation company was not exempt from taxation under the farm machinery or equipment exemption as an irrigation ditch could not be placed on the market for retail sale and, therefore, could not qualify as farm machinery or equipment. Further, appellant was a lump sum contractor as well as a consumer of tangible personal property subject to taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission challenged a judgment of the trial court which declared Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 666-16 1/2(A)(9)(b) unconstitutional on the ground of vagueness and permanently enjoined appellant from enforcing the provision with respect to non-resident sellers with whom appellee business had business dealings or with respect to appellee's purchaser as holder of a Texas wholesaler's permit. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and held that a review of the evidence disclosed that appellee failed to establish the criteria necessary under the law to hold the statute unconstitutional because of vagueness. The statute was sufficiently definite for those affected by it to understand its meaning so as to know under what circumstances they would have transgressed its provision, and that was all that was required. The court also held that it was presumed that if a statute was susceptible of a construction which would render it valid and operative, it had to be so construed even though it might also have been possible to interpret the provisions in a manner which would have resulted in its invalidity.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review of the judgment claiming that venue was not proper in Brazoria County because it had no &quot;agency or representative&quot; there and that the venue statute for foreign corporations was unconstitutional. The court reformed the judgment to eliminate penalties and attorney fees and affirmed the judgment as reformed. The court explained that appellant had a licensed local recording agent in Brazoria County and such agent created an agency or representative under the statute for venue purposes. The court rejected appellant's constitutional argument based on precedent.

The trial court granted appellee's motion and decreed that appellant took nothing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers brought suit against defendant school district challenging the assessment of the evaluation of their properties for taxation purposes. The trial court set aside a prior temporary restraining order and denied temporary injunction, which plaintiffs appealed, and the court affirmed. The Board of Equalization had not attempted to set the fair market value of the property according to Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, civil statutes, or the Texas Education Code, which required that assessments be based on reasonable cash market value. The court held that the assessed values of the land were unconstitutional, contrary to the civil statutes, and grossly unfair, and that the form of taxation used by defendant to tax the cattle was grossly unconstitutional and unfair. However, the court held that no attack on valuation fixed by a board of equalization would be sustained in the absence of proof of fraud, want of jurisdiction, illegality, or the adoption of an arbitrary and fundamentally erroneous plan or scheme of valuation. The court concluded that plaintiffs did not show they had been damaged or discriminated against in any way by the taxation that had been placed upon them.</SPAN></P>

At trial evidence was presented that a private investigator employed by a retail merchants association purchased various allegedly proscribed items from various of retail outlets owned by appellant. The trial court deemed appellant's ownership of the stores admitted and issued a temporary injunction. The court reversed and dissolved the injunction, holding that even though the trial court properly exercised its broad discretion in issuing the injunction, the trial court improperly abridged appellant's privilege against self-incrimination with the judicially invoked admission because a criminal facet was linked to the civil statute.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the exception to that rule, that equity would intervene in criminal proceedings where the statute sought to be enforced was unconstitutional or otherwise void and enforcement thereunder involved an invasion of property rights which would result in irreparable injury thereto, did not apply because appellants failed to discharge their burden of establishing that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Further, notice provisions in the Act did not contravene the Equal Protection Clauses of the Texas and United States Constitutions, as suggested by appellant. Finally, appellee was not required to comply with notice provisions in art. 1573 (1962).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs entered a non-competition agreement with defendants in consideration of a dismissal of defendants' suit against plaintiffs. Plaintiffs, former employees of defendants, agreed not to employ any person employed by defendants, to engage in the manufacturer of boots or to disclose confidential information or trade secrets. Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief. The trial court granted declaratory relief and imposed an injunction against plaintiffs. Both parties sought review. The reviewing court reversed the declaratory relief and voided the temporary injunction, holding the contract between the parties was void where the promises unnecessarily restrained competition. Where the contract contained legal promises of plaintiff company and illegal promises of individual plaintiffs, the court found the contract was not severable and was void entirely. The reviewing court held the injunction was overly broad where it prohibited defendants' former employees to enter employment with plaintiffs for reasons unrelated to wrongful solicitation or inducement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action by appellee attorneys against appellant city for fees, the 189th District Court, Harris County (Texas) entered judgment for appellees. Appellant challenged the order, claiming that the parties' contract was illegal, unconstitutional, and improperly executed, that its enforcement was time-barred by Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 5526 (1965), that appellees had a conflict of interest, and that the contract did not cover their services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for appellee attorneys in their action against appellant city to recover legal fees under a contract. It held that appellant had waived its failure-to-execute defense under Tex. R. Civ. P. 93(h) by not making a sworn denial of the contract's execution or of the city council's authority to execute it. It held that appellant had also waived its arguments of illegality and unconstitutionality because it had failed to assert these as affirmative defenses under Tex. R. Civ. P. 94; although unconstitutionality was not specifically listed as an affirmative defense, the court found that it was asserted to avoid liability under the contract and therefore was such a defense. Thus, it found, the agreement was an enforceable contract in writing and therefore was not affected by the statute of limitations of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5526 (1965). It held that appellees' defending an ordinance against a challenge by the mayor were services to appellant as contemplated by the contract. Finally, it found that appellant's contention that appellees had a conflict of interest was also an affirmative defense that appellant had failed to raise.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that appellant city had waived its defenses that a contract to employ appellee attorneys was improperly executed, illegal, and unconstitutional, along with its defense that appellees had a conflict of interest, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment in appellees' favor, also finding that the contract was not affected by the statute of limitations and that appellees' services fell within those contemplated by the contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an annulment action brought by appellants, blood relatives of the deceased wife, against appellees, who were her husband, another individual, and a bank, the court affirmed the trial court's order instructing a jury verdict in favor of appellees. It rejected appellants' argument that the wife had not consented to the marriage because she had not audibly responded to questions during the ceremony, finding that her consent was evidenced by her performing the legal prerequisites to marriage and noting that the Texas Family Code did not prescribe a form for the ceremony. It found that the marriage could not be annulled for mental incompetency, fraud, or duress because Tex. Fam. Code Ann. &sect; 2.47 (1970) barred a suit on those grounds if it was initiated after a spouse's death. It rejected appellants' argument that &sect; 2.47 violated Tex. Const. art.

Appellant argued that the tax was unconstitutional, violating appellant's equal protection rights under Tex. Const. art. VIII and the U.S. Const. amend.

Appellant admitted taxing only merchandise, furniture, fixtures, and inventory of businesses, but taxing jewelry, boats, trailers, bank deposits, stocks, bonds, mortgages, and other personalty of individuals. The trial court entered summary judgment for appellee, and appellant sought review.

The court found that injunctive relief was not available to appellee voters. The court stated that the rule was well established in Texas that the equitable powers of the courts could not be invoked to interfere with public officials who were taking any of the steps involved in an election.

When the trial court overruled appellant's procedural objections and entered judgment sustaining the grant of the charter, appellant sought review. The court affirmed. Considering the record as a whole, the court was of the opinion that a commissioner's finding on the necessary savings available was reasonably supported by substantial evidence. The need for mortgage funds in appellee's area was immediate and likely to increase. The order was presumptively supported by substantial evidence. Appellant did not undertake to point out where the order lacked the required evidentiary support. Appellee's county was an importer of mortgage funds. Borrowers had to go outside the area to obtain funds because the area was growing so rapidly. The court overruled appellant's claim that the trial court erred in failing to hold commissioner's order invalid for failure to make a concise statement of facts to support findings of public need, volume of business for profitable operation, and that appellee's operation would not unduly harm any existing association.</SPAN></P>

Appellee city charged appellant with violations under Dallas, Tex., Ordinance No. 7469, &sect;&sect; 3 and 4. The ordinance restricted the manner in which projecting signs were changed and erected. A violation of the ordinance was a misdemeanor offense. Appellant contended that &sect; 3 was discriminatory against it as a member of a class, was unreasonable in its operation, was vague and indefinite and violative of due process and equal protection under the Federal and Texas Constitutions. Appellant brought an action against appellee, seeking a temporary injunction on grounds that &sect; 3 was unconstitutional. The lower court denied appellant's request for a temporary injunction. On appeal, the decision was affirmed.

Appellant mortgagee, which held a vendor's lien note secured by the property, received nothing as the trial court determined that its security interest had not been impaired. On appeal from the award to appellees, the court held that as only part of the land was taken, appellant was entitled to receive only so much of the award as would compensate it for the impairment of its security and as appellant did not question the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court's finding that its security interest had not been impaired, the judgment was appropriate. The court also held that Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16 did not apply as this section does not inhibit judicial action except when based on an invalid statute.&nbsp;Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 17 did not apply as no question of adequacy of compensation was raised. Finally, the court held that the deed conveying the land was an executed, not executory, contract despite appellant's vendor's lien and concomitant &quot;superior title&quot;.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the Texas Supreme Court, the trial court affirmed an order of appellee Texas State Board of Registration of Professional Engineers (board) revoking appellant engineer's license. The case was tried under the substantial evidence rule and the trial court issued six findings of fact and conclusions of law. Both parties appealed the decision. On appeal, the court held that the law of the case had been established as to all matters pertaining to procedural due process of law by the Texas Supreme Court in its opinion on appellant's application for writ of error and such conclusions were binding on the court and the trial court. Consequently, the trial court's procedural due process findings were contrary to the Supreme Court decision and must yield to the law of the case. Similarly, it was unnecessary to review appellant's complaints of denial of due process as the Supreme Court already held that there was no such denial. The court held that the prior appeal had already determined that the review was governed by the substantial evidence rule and the lack of any statutory provision providing for supersedeas or stay was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, finding that the Texas Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility Law, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

However, the court questioned the trial court's jurisdiction and determined that verified denials of good cause were not required by art. 6701h, and thus the trial court had jurisdiction where appellee did not object to appellant's claim of good cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant trucking company appealed the decision of the District Court of Harris County (Texas), which entered judgment for and awarded damages to plaintiff survivors of the deceased in plaintiffs' death action in which actual and exemplary damages were sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff survivors of the deceased filed a death action against defendant trucking company. After a jury trial, judgment was entered for plaintiffs, and damages were awarded, defendant appealed. The court concluded that Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 8306, &sect; 12g (Act) permitted plaintiffs to pursue a third party action against defendant without regard to compensation paid under the workmen's compensation law. Defendant's compensation insurance carrier paid plaintiffs workmen's compensation death benefits. Section 12g was enacted to penalize employers who passed on the cost of workmen's compensation insurance to their employees. In &sect; 12g, the legislature gave employees the right to secure full compensation for the injuries that they might sustain by reason of the negligence of their employer. An employer's immunity from suit, created by legislative act, was thus withdrawn by legislative act, and the employer's common law defenses were abolished. Defendant could not have been held liable for the compensatory damages except for its voluntary act of withholding premiums for compensation insurance in violation of a valid law, and then only after negligence on its part was established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment awarding damages to plaintiff survivors of the deceased was affirmed. The pertinent statute, as construed by the trial court, did not deprive defendant trucking company of its property without due process of law, nor deny to it the equal protection of the law. The statute was not capricious or arbitrary, nor did it unreasonably discriminate against a class of which defendant was a member.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that such ordinance was void and unenforceable. Appellant, the City of Houston, sought review. The court reversed. The court held that appellant's legislative body had the authority and responsibility to determine factually whether the practices followed in the operation of automotive wrecking and salvage yards so adversely affected the health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants of the city as to call for the exercise of the police power in regulating them.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Dallas County (Texas), which after a jury trial found that appellee claimant was partially disabled for two years. Appellant asserted that a wage rate was not proven, the retroactive application of a rule change was unconstitutional, an order in limine was improper, there was no evidence or insufficient evidence, and a motion for mistrial should have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee claimant did detailed assembly work that required the use of a microscope. She claimed a workers' compensation injury after she bent down to do something at work. There was conflicting evidence about the seriousness and duration of her injury. The jury found partial, temporary incapacity. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court had not erred in applying Tex. R. Civ. P. 93(n), as amended by new subsection (8), which required that the wage rate be presumed true unless controverted by a verified pleading because appellant had ample opportunity after the rule went in to effect and before the trial to obtain necessary information, and retroactive application of the procedural rule did not violate Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16, and had not been an abuse of the trial court's discretion. Further, an objection to an order in limine had not been preserved for review, there was some evidence of appellee's injury to support the jury's determination, and appellee was not required to prove her ability to earn wages in the future in a specific amount. Finally, appellant's motion for mistrial was based on non-prejudicial error at worst and was properly denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in a workers' compensation case awarding temporary, partial disability because appellant insurer was not constitutionally or otherwise prejudiced by the retroactive application of a procedural rule requiring a verified denial of the wage rate, procedural error was either harmless or not preserved, and there was some evidence to support the jury's determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant voters sought review of a decision of the 151st District Court of Harris County (Texas), which denied appellant's petition for a writ of mandamus to special election, and injunctive relief, in a case disputing a city counsel's appointment of a counsel member when the incumbent declined to serve. Appellants asserted that the appointment violated Tex. Const. art. 6, &sect; 3, U.S. Const. amend XIV, and several election statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Houston, Texas, city councilman was reelected for a two-year term. Before the new term began he resigned and declined to stand for the new term. The city council appointed another individual to serve as councilman for the new term. Appellant voters brought an action to compel a special election and to enjoin the appointee from exercising his office on the grounds that the appointment process under Houston, Tex., Charter art. VII, &sect; 2, violated Tex. Const. art. 6, &sect; 3, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and several election statutes. Trial was to the court, which denied the requested relief. On appeal, the court affirmed because the legislature's delegation of the power of appointment had been upheld by the Texas Supreme Court, so logically a city council could do the same thing, and there was no federal requirement that local officials be selected by a popular vote as long as the alternative was constitutionally sound. The court held it unnecessary to consider the alleged statutory violations since Houston was a home rule city with an appointive process and appellants had not presented evidence of compliance with appropriate procedural requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the trial court in an election case that denied injunctive relief to appellant voters who complained of the appointment of a city council member when the incumbent declined to serve because there was no constitutional impediment to such an appointive process and any statutory violations were either inappropriate for a home rule city or had not been presented in the proper procedural context.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee taxpayers received a certificate from the tax assessor certifying that there were no delinquent state or county taxes unpaid on the subject property and stating that the certificate was not to be construed as a receipt as to such taxes. Appellant state filed a suit against appellees to recover allegedly delinquent ad valorem state and county taxes for the property for the year covered in the certificate. The trial court granted appellees' summary judgment motion on the ground that the certificate barred appellant's recovery. Appellant challenged the judgment and the denial of appellant's summary judgment motion. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the certificate issued by the tax assessor as to taxes paid was in substantial compliance with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7258a (repealed 1969) and constituted conclusive proof of full payment and a bar to the recovery of taxes due on the subject property, and that the statement on the certificate to the effect that the certificate did not constitute a receipt was immaterial.

Appellee had accumulated 205 days of sick leave when he became permanently and totally disabled. Appellant attempted to retire appellee involuntarily and tendered appellee a check for 90 days of sick leave.

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that S. Res. 622, 1971 Legis.

Senate Bill 622, was not in conflict with The Firemen's and Policemen's Civil Service Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant trucking companies challenged an order from a trial court in Travis County (Texas), which sustained a senate bill as constitutional and denied appellant's application for a temporary injunction to enjoin appellees, Railroad Commission of Texas, its members and nine carriers, from certain trucking operations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant trucking companies sought to declare invalid orders obtained from appellee Railroad Commission of Texas regarding certain trucking operations, claiming that the orders lacked adequate findings. Appellant's original claim for injunctive relief was on remand when Senate Bill No. 961 was passed ratifying appellee's orders as to the trucking operations regardless of whether they contained full findings of fact. The lower court denied appellants relief. Appellants sought review on grounds that the bill was unconstitutional and contrary to Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 56. The court held that although the bill's enforcement was confined to a restricted area, it was constitutional because of the presumption that the legislature was considering the needs of the people of the entire state in the trucking operations in question. The court also held that the bill did not deny equal protection because its classification as to certain motor carriers was not arbitrary. Finally, the court held that the bill did not divest appellants of a private right established by judgment because appellants did not have a vested right in the use of the public highways.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment sustaining validity of a senate bill and denying appellant trucking companies' temporary injunction was affirmed on the grounds that the legislature presumably considered the interests of the people of the entire state in passing the locally enforced bill, had a reasonable basis for classifying the bill's application to certain motor carriers, and did not divest appellant of a private right established by judgment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that discontinuance of water service was a taking of appellee's property without due process of law and a violation of his constitutional guarantee under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, and enjoined appellant from enforcing &sect; 12. The court reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court because exclusive control of garbage disposal by appellant was an essential health matter and the right to regulate the same was within the police powers of appellant. The court held that garbage disposal fell within the same category as sewage disposal and since appellant had the right to require its inhabitants to accept garbage and sewer services, it could require them to bear the expense thereof by payment of reasonable fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant securities commissioner sought review of a decision of the District Court of Travis County, 167th Judicial District (Texas), which set aside appellant's order to revoke the secondary trading in securities that was issued by appellee securities trader under the Texas Securities Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 581, &sect; 5-O.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant securities commissioner extended his order to revoke the secondary trading in securities of appellee securities trader. Appellee sought review of the decision in the trial court, which set aside appellant's order. Appellant sought review of that decision and claimed that appellee was not entitled to judicial review. The court affirmed the decision and held that appellee had a right to judicial review by a trial de novo under the Texas Securities Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 581, &sect; 5- O. The court found that the right of judicial review applied to any aggrieved party, including appellee, even though that section was in a paragraph that dealt with recognition of a securities manual revocation. Additionally, art. 581, &sect; 27 allowed any aggrieved dealer to seek judicial review, which applied to appellant, although appellant only traded his own stock. Once appellee's trading examination was granted, it was protected by the due process clauses of the United States and Texas Constitutions. The court held that art. 581, &sect; 5-O was constitutional because it properly balanced appellant's police powers with appellee's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corporations filed an action against appellant state taxing authority to recover certain franchise taxes paid under protest. Appellant challenged the judgment in favor of appellees, and the court reversed. The court held that under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 12.01, 12.19, and 12.20, appellant correctly computed and assessed the tax in the manner prescribed. The court ruled that the statutory formula of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 12.20(2) provided that additional franchise tax be measured by 18.18 percent of the regular franchise tax paid by appellees as shown on their franchise tax report and did not allow any proration of the amount. The court held that appellant's method of computing the additional tax was not a retroactive tax, which would be unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. As appellant's tax computation was correct, the court found that the lower court's judgment in favor of appellees was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Texas State Board of Medical Examiners issued an order revoking appellant doctor's license to practice medicine. The trial court upheld the order, ruling that it was supported by substantial evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that appellant's acts with respect to his improper conduct with female patients, his prescription of amphetamine drugs, and his attempt to perform an abortion constituted grossly unprofessional conduct likely to deceive the public so as to violate Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4505, &sect; 4. The court held that &sect; 4 was not unconstitutionally vague because the broad jurisdiction vested in appellee was necessary in defining unprofessional conduct. The legislature had the power, under Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 31, to limit the review of appellee's action to a substantial evidence inquiry. The notice, hearing and review provided for in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4506, did not deprive appellant of due process. The admission of expert witness testimony as to whether appellant's conduct violated &sect; 4, did not amount to a denial of appellant's rights or cause the rendition of an improper judgment requiring reversal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, mother and her second husband, filed a petition to change the last name of appellee mother and appellant father's child to the last name of appellee second husband. The trial court granted the petition. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in entering judgment without notice to appellant because it amounted to a denial of procedural due process in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19. The court found that due process clearly required timely notice of the purpose and scope of the proceeding that affected the relationship of appellant and his child. The court found that the interest of the child was paramount and that, under some circumstances, it could have been in the child's best interest to retain appellant's, his natural father, last name. Appellant had an interest in the proceeding and should have been given notice because such notice was guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19.</SPAN></P>
