</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants sought review of their convictions entered on jury verdicts in a trial court of Roane County (Tennessee) of burglary and safecracking. Defendants claimed that because they had no intention of opening a safe while in the premises their convictions under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3-404(b)(1) should be reversed and that the trial court erred when it answered a question propounded by the jury during deliberations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants and others broke into a store. When they found the store safe could not be moved, they backed a truck up to the store intending to load the safe onto the truck. Defendants claimed that because the safe was not opened on the premises, there was no offense under &sect; 39-3-404(b)(1). Defendants also claimed that the trial court's answer to a jury question regarding an indeterminate sentence was in error because it informed the jury of the role of the parole board in determining whether defendants would serve a minimum or maximum sentence. The court affirmed. Attempts to open a safe were unlawful. The fact that the safe was moved to the truck for transportation elsewhere did not diminish from the fact that an opening was intended. The trial court did err in telling the jury that how long defendants stayed in jail was determined by the parole board. The matter of the future disposition of defendants was not a proper consideration by a jury when it was determining the length of defendants' sentence. However, the court found the error harmless because it was clear by the minimum sentence imposed that the jury was not prejudiced by the erroneous instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Criminal Court for Sullivan County (Tennessee), which convicted him of arson and found him to be an habitual criminal. The trial court fixed his punishment as confinement for not less than 4 nor more than 10 years for arson, enhanced to life imprisonment for being an habitual criminal. Defendant alleged that the habitual criminal punishment of life imprisonment was violative of the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's apartment was set on fire. Two witnesses testified that defendant offered to pay them to pour kerosene in the apartment and to set it on fire. The witnesses poured the kerosene on the premises, but did not set the fire. The witnesses drove defendant from a bar to the apartment. The apartment was ablaze when defendant returned to the witnesses' car. The court affirmed and held as follows: (1) there was sufficient corroboration evidence t support the testimony of the State's witnesses because it fairly and legitimately tended to connect defendant with the commission of the crime; (2) the trial court did not err in failing to grant a continuance to allow defendant to compel the attendance of two witnesses because their testimony would have been cumulative to the alibi established by a testifying witness; and (3) the trial court did not err in sentencing defendant as a habitual offender because defendant had a career of crime spanning some 31 years, during which he was convicted of forgery, forging and passing forged checks, felony escape, burglary, and bail jumping.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of burglarizing the victim's dwelling home. The court found that burglary was offense against the possession, rather than the legal title, and that the victim was a tenant in possession of the home as that term was used in the statutory definition of burglary in the second degree. Although the trial court erroneously charged the jury on the lesser-included offense of attempt to commit an assault, the court determined that the error was harmless because defendant was not convicted of the offense erroneously charged. The court ruled that there was no merit to defendant's contention that the trial court erred by telling the prosecution it would allow the indictment to be amended to fix the dates of prior convictions because defendant was on notice concerning the correct dates and because there were sufficient prior convictions without the amendment from which the jury could have found that defendant was an habitual criminal. Affirming, the court held that the trial court's comments concerning the correction of an obvious error in its charge did not affect the merits or prejudice defendant by inducing agreement upon a verdict.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's conviction and sentence were sustained on appeal, but the execution was stayed pending disposition of a proper petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in ruling that a post-conviction proceeding not be employed to question the sufficiency of the evidence in the original trial. Defendant also asserted that the trial court erred in admitting four prior convictions in the sentencing portion of the bifurcated trial, which were for crimes committed subsequent to the murder, and in instructing the jury on mitigating circumstances. Finally, defendant argued that the imposition of the death penalty violated his constitutional rights. The court held that a post-conviction petition was not to be used to question the sufficiency of the convicting evidence. Although the court determined that defendant waived certain issues by failing to object, the court examined those issues by reason of defendant's allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. The court also concluded that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-203(i)(2) included subsequent crimes as aggravated circumstances, and that the instruction for mitigating circumstances was adequate. The court found that the imposition of the death penalty did not violate defendant's constitutional rights and was not arbitrary of capricious.</SPAN></P>

In answer, the State listed the inmate's prior convictions, which included possession of burglary tools, store housebreaking, dwelling housebreaking, and statutory burglary. There were five convictions spanning the years from 1958 to 1968.

The trial court dismissed the motion as untimely. Defendant filed a notice of appeal and a petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court dismissed the petition without an evidentiary hearing. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and the denial of the petition for post-conviction relief. The court held that defendant's second motion for a new trial was untimely under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-401 and Tenn. R. Crim. P. 33(b). Moreover, because that motion was a nullity, the only issues that were reviewable by the court were those that were not required to be listed in a motion for a new trial, consistent with Tenn. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgments of a trial court for Madison County (Tennessee) that convicted him of aggravated assault, two counts of armed robbery, and temporarily taking an automobile. He was sentenced to serve four years for aggravated assault, thirty years for each of the armed robbery convictions, and one year for taking the automobile. All of defendant's sentences were ordered to run concurrently.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant grabbed a woman on her way to her car from a grocery store, held a knife to her throat, and ordered her, a clerk, and another woman to put the groceries in the car. He then entered the vehicle and drove away. Defendant asserted that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict, that the indictment charging aggravated assault was fatally defective because it had an erroneous statute citation therein, that the armed robbery statute was unconstitutional, and that the trial judge erroneously allowed the State to show defendant had previously been convicted of burglary. The court affirmed the judgments, finding there was sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The indictment at issue contained sufficient and appropriate charging words to allege the offense. The court also held that an erroneous recitation of a statute was mere surplusage and not fatal to the charging instrument. Defendant had failed to raise any objection to the indictment, and the issue was waived. The constitutional attack was without merit. Because burglary involved dishonesty, defendant's prior conviction could be used for impeachment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were convicted for participating in a burglary of a department store. The court held that there was sufficient evidence to convict them. The jury verdict, approved by the trial judge, accredited the testimony of the witnesses for the State and resolved all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the State. The participants gave jewelry to their girlfriends taken from the store in a motel room. One of the girlfriends testified for the State. The court held that she was not an accomplice because she took stolen jewelry and that her testimony did not have to be corroborated. One defendant's attorney did not have to be subpoenaed from out-of-state because his testimony would not make him a material witness. Defendants were not entitled to a change of venue. One defendant voluntarily made a confession that did not have to be suppressed. One defendant's live-in girlfriend had the authority to consent to a search of their residence. The mandatory life sentences under the habitual criminal statutes were not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was not notified until the morning of trial that the State intended to seek enhanced punishment under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-202(a). On appeal, defendant argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it allegedly did not require sufficient notice that the State intended to seek an enhanced punishment, thus interfering with the plea bargaining process. In affirming the conviction and sentence, the court first found that the range of punishment for petit larceny was clearly set out in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 34-3-1104(a) and that the trial court was required to consider the enhancement and mitigating factors set forth in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-35-106 through 40-35 111. And, noting that defendant's sentencing occurred five weeks after the trial and that no continuance was sought, the court concluded that defendant was not prejudiced by having received notice on the day of trial. Next, the court found that defendant suffered no prejudice from the State's introduction of testimony from witnesses who were not listed on the indictment, especially since defendant, who was invited to a pretrial interview of the witnesses, did not object to the testimony or move for a continuance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in allowing the State to elicit evidence of his prior incarceration, in instructing the jury on the element of malice and on felony murder, and in ruling that if defendant testified, he could have been questioned about a prior conviction. The court held that the complained-of questions addressed to a witness concerned defendant's incarceration pending trial on the instant charge and thus were properly allowed. The court found that the trial court did not instruct the jury that malice would be presumed or otherwise unlawfully shift the burden of persuasion to defendant and did not charge the jury concerning the elements of felony murder. The court determined, however, that the charge did contain the full statutory definition of murder in the first degree, which could not have misled or confused the jury. The court concluded that because the issue at trial was defendant's intent, his prior conviction for premeditated murder was probative of his truthfulness or untruthfulness concerning his intent in the instant case, and thus, the probative value of the prior conviction outweighed any prejudicial effect resulting from its admission.</SPAN></P>

The record showed that he apparently did not waive his right to counsel, but there was no affirmative showing that he had counsel. His case was remanded for resentencing. The court affirmed his conviction on the first indictment count and found that the failure to allow him a telephone call before his incarceration did not violate his constitutional rights. He did not show that the police violated Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-7-106(b) or that he was prejudiced by the lack of a timely telephone call. His counsel's failure to advise him of his right to have an additional blood sample extracted for independent analysis under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-410(e) did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of aggravated rape under &sect; 39-2-603. The trial court denied his post conviction petition alleging that the statute was unconstitutional because it required a sexual penetration and constituted gender discrimination, and defendant sought review. Section 39-2-603 defined aggravated rape as the &quot;unlawful sexual penetration of another&quot; accompanied by any one of several specified circumstances. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-602(11) defined sexual penetration as sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, or any other intrusion, however slight, of any part of a person's body or of any object into the genital or anal openings of another person's body. The court found that nowhere did the statute require that the victim be a woman. The court also determined that a female could have committed the offense against a male in spite of the biological differences in the two sexes. The court held that sexual offenses were constitutional even when offenses could have been only committed against women. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court fined defendant $ 300 for his convictions and sentenced him to 11 months and 29 days in jail for the driving while intoxicated charge. Defendant sought review and contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the convictions. The court found that, under Tenn. R. App. P. 13(e), the evidence was sufficient to justify a rational trier of fact in finding defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that subjecting defendant's blood to testing by the hospital laboratory had not amounted to an unconstitutional search and seizure under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-406 because the statutory provision only applied to tests conducted by medical professionals at the request of law enforcement officers. Because the blood was drawn for medical purposes, the court held that defendant's rights under the statute had not been violated. The court also found that defendant's rights under the Fourth Amendment and Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 had not been violated because such rights were inapplicable to intrusions made by private parties. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the statute, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-612 was unconstitutional as applied to consenting heterosexual adults for various reasons. The court rejected defendant's arguments concerning the constitutionality of the statute. The court first noted that, as a factual matter, the evidence demonstrated that the victim had not consented to the sexual act committed on her by defendant. The court pointed out that consent was not an element of the crime. The court found that, even if consent was a significant issue, the statute was broad enough to be constitutionally applied to consenting heterosexual adults unmarried to each other. The court found that the State had a valid interest in proscribing conduct, which was debasing, dehumanizing, demoralizing, degrading and which constituted a threat to the general welfare of its citizenry. Finally, defendant failed to preserve his claim as to the trial court's interpretation of the law by failing to submit any instructions as to his theory that the law excluded consensual adult heterosexual activity.</SPAN></P>

The evidence was more than sufficient to show defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt of armed robbery and aggravated rape. It was clear that the allegations in the indictment, and the proof presented were sufficient to protect defendant from a future prosecution for the same offense. There was no fatal variance between the indictment and the proof. The officers had probable cause to stop the vehicle and arrest the suspects, and the subsequent search and seizure of the evidence were lawful. The death penalty was no longer available as one of the penalties for robbery, accomplished by the use of a deadly weapon; therefore, such offense was no longer a capital offense in Tennessee. Defendant's punishment for the offense was properly imposed by the court, rather than by the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district attorney general and the groups agreed that the machines would be sold to out-of-state buyers and that the money in the machines would be prorated among the groups. The Attorney General opposed the plan. The groups argued that the Attorney General had no right to intervene because he had no interest in the subject matter of the litigation, because the interest of the state was adequately protected by the district attorney general, and because Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 5 gave the district attorney general the exclusive authority to file criminal actions. The court held that: (1) because the proceeding to forfeit the machines was civil in nature, not criminal, the Attorney General had an unconditional right to intervene; (2) the groups were not exempted from the gambling statute by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-6-609 because slot machines and electronic gambling devices did not meet the definition of those games that were exempt; (3) the forfeiture statute, Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The child was brought to a hospital and the x-rays revealed a fracture to the left thigh bone and two or three broken ribs.

A specialist in pediatric orthopedics testified that he examined the child after he was taken to the hospital, and it was his opinion that the type of fracture could not have resulted from any cause other than child abuse. Defendants offered no proof. On appeal they argued that the State failed to prove that either or both of them assaulted the child or that the child's injuries resulted from a criminal act. The court agreed with the State and held that the evidence supported the finding that the child's injuries were inflicted by criminal agency and that circumstantial evidence placed the child in the custody of defendants during the time period in which the assaults occurred. The court held that these factors alone, however, did not support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that either or both of defendants inflicted the injuries.

Defendants claimed they were not permitted to inspect certain physical evidence introduced at trial. The court found defendants had failed to ask for tangible objects. The State's duty to disclose under Tenn. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(C) arose only upon a request. The court found that the State had inaccurately supplied the results of only one of two scientific tests showing spermatozoa from the victim. Defendants showed no prejudice, and the error was de minimus. Defendants objected to evidence found in their car because the chain of custody was not sufficiently established. However, the car was secured when defendants were arrested, it was stored at the local police station, and the next day towed to the crime lab for examination. Finally, the aggravated rape statute, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-603, was not unconstitutionally vague and did not impermissibly overlap Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-604.</SPAN></P>

Two officers subdued the highly intoxicated defendant, who denied drinking alcohol at a night club where he spent a number of hours prior to his arrest.

Defendant was convicted and sentenced for DUI as a second offender. On appeal, the court reversed and dismissed defendant's conviction and remanded the cause for the criminal court to sentence defendant for DUI as a first offender. As the record of defendant's first conviction was silent as to whether defendant was represented and the waiver of counsel could not be presumed from a silent record, the criminal court erred in refusing defendant's motion for acquittal under the enhancement count.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on a charge of being an habitual criminal by the Criminal Court of Williamson County (Tennessee) after the State appealed a dismissal of the charge, filed along with a forgery charge on which defendant was convicted, and retrial was ordered. Defendant appealed after his motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds under the federal and state constitutions was denied, and he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Though defendant, who had a total of 22 felony convictions, was convicted of forgery, a habitual criminal charge was dismissed. On the State's appeal, the court reversed and remanded for trial. When the trial court denied a defense motion to dismiss and defendant was then convicted thereon, defendant appealed. He claimed that retrial constituted double jeopardy in violation of state and federal constitutions, but the court disagreed. Noting that the prior direction that defendant was to be retried was the law of the case, it stated that the doctrine of res judicata applied to the judgment of an appeals court acting within its jurisdiction. Such a decision on a matter within its jurisdiction not only precluded further action on the same matter between the parties, but if the same matter later came in question between the same parties before an appeals court, the court was bound by its own former decision. Because the court had jurisdiction over the appeal, the determination that remand and retrial were proper was res judicata on the double jeopardy issue. Nor was the resulting punishment constitutionally improper for violating the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's conviction on a charge of being a habitual criminal and the ensuing life sentence imposed on him were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of aggravated rape. Appellant sought review of a judgment of a trial court of Shelby County (Tennessee), which denied his petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, appellant alleged that the aggravated rape statute under which he was convicted, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-603 (formerly Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3703), was unconstitutional and that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to challenge the constitutionality of that statute. Appellant contended the statute was overbroad and allowed a conviction for consensual sexual activity. The court found that the allegation that the statute was unconstitutional should have been raised on direct appeal and was thus not cognizable in a post-conviction proceeding. As to appellant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim, under the charge as given by the trial court, &quot;force or coercion&quot; was an indispensable element of aggravated rape. Proof of consensual penetration would have negated any criminal aspects of the activity. Appellant's trial counsel therefore had no basis upon which to challenge the statute's constitutionality. The court concluded that appellant's trial counsel did not violate the Baxter v. Rose guidelines by failing to attack the constitutionality of the aggravated rape statute.</SPAN></P>

Defendant therein claimed that the trial court erred in overruling a motion for a preliminary hearing and in joining charges of armed robbery and aggravated assault for trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged after he showed a gun to a store clerk in an effort to obtain free beer. When police apprehended him, he pointed the gun at an officer. When convicted on the assault charge, defendant appealed, but the court affirmed. It rejected a defense claim that his preliminary hearing motion was improperly denied; though Tenn. R. Crim. P. 5 required the motion to be filed within 30 days of an indictment, defendant's motion was not filed until almost five months later, and it was properly denied as untimely. Nor did the trial court err in denying a defense motion for severance of offenses because evidence of each offense was admissible in separate trials to show the intent and motive of defendant in the other. Finally, the provision in Tenn. R. Crim. P. 32(b) that required persons who were on parole at the time they committed subsequent offenses to receive consecutive sentencing was not unconstitutional. The legislature was entitled to create reasonable classifications of persons for the purpose of imposing criminal penalties limited only by prohibitions of cruel and unusual punishment, due process, and equal protection, none of which was violated by Rule 32(b).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that because simple rape under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-604(a)(1) required proof of the element of force or coercion, while aggravated rape under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2-603(a)(2) did not require proof of force or coercion, &sect; 39-2-603(a)(2) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Defendant also claimed that because aggravated assault was a lesser-included offense of aggravated rape, he could not be convicted of both. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The term rape was commonly understood and proscribed as sexual penetration accomplished by force and without the consent or against the will of the victim. Section 39-2-603(a)(2) proscribed aggravated rape and necessarily incorporated the definition of rape being but an aggravated form of the same offense; therefore, it was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Because the allegations in the indictment that charged aggravated rape included the elements of aggravated assault, defendant was correct that the aggravated assault offense was a lesser-included offense of the aggravated rape offense and he should not have been convicted for the crime of aggravated assault.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of burglary. After deliberating for three hours, the jury informed the trial judge that they were unable to reach a verdict as to the habitual criminal count of the indictment, and continued deliberation would not help. The trial judge entered a mistrial and retried defendant on the habitual criminal count. Defendant contended that the mistrial order was error and his subsequent retrial was a violation of the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. The court stated that since &quot;manifest necessity&quot; warranted the discharge of the jury and the ordering of a mistrial, the prohibition against double jeopardy was not violated by the second trial. Defendant also asserted that the Tennessee Habitual Criminal Statute was unconstitutional, as violative of the Eighth Amendment. The court found that the Tennessee statute was not unconstitutional. The court noted that habitual criminals were not confined to life without possibility of parole, but that they were eligible for parole after serving 30 years.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, two individuals and an organization, sought review of their convictions in the trial court in Shelby County (Tennessee) on charges brought against them by the state for attempting to procure a female to become a prostitute, engaging in prostitution, exhibition of obscene materials, and possession of obscene materials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two defendants were arrested during a raid of a swingers club, which was the third defendant. They all claimed that the statute under which they were prosecuted was too vague to pass constitutional muster. Additionally, one individual contended that the trial judge erred by refusing to grant a severance as to the defendants and as to the offenses. On review, the court found that all of the activities of defendants were parts of a common scheme or plan to operate the swingers club, and to have granted a severance of offenses or defendants would have been a terrible waste of scarce judicial resources. By contrast, the court determined that the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress the three pornographic films. At the time of the raid, one of the pornographic films was being exhibited. The pornographic nature of the film was obvious, and the film was in &quot;plain view&quot; of the officers who were lawfully on the premises. Hence, it was properly seized. However, the closed, unmarked film containers were not subject to seizure under the same rationale, and they were not identified in the search warrant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that two of the films were improperly seized, but in all other regards affirmed the convictions of the trial court. The court modified the judgments against defendants by reducing the sentence of an individual and reducing the fine imposed on the organization. The conviction of the other defendant was affirmed without modification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction and sentence by a trial court (Tennessee) for a second offense of driving while under the influence of an intoxicant (DUI). He was fined and sentenced to 11 months, 29 days in jail. The trial judge ordered that after the completion of 45 days of continuous confinement, the remainder of defendant's jail sentence would be suspended. Defendant was not eligible for work release during the 45- day sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the legal validity of the trial court's denial of work release during the service of the 45-day jail sentence. He argued that the DUI penalty law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403, did not preclude him from immediate work release eligibility. Affirming, the court held that work release was a form of probation, and under the language of &sect; 55-10-403, defendant was not eligible for work release until the completion of the mandatory 45-day sentence. Further, the court held that the legislature intended &sect; 55-10-403 as an exception to the more general provisions of the Criminal Sentencing Reform Act, whose misdemeanor sentencing provision, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-302(d), allowed for the possibility of immediate work release. Thus, the court held that in DUI cases, sentencing was controlled by the DUI penalty statute,&nbsp;Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 55-10-403. Finally, the minimum mandatory sentencing provision of &sect; 55-10-403 was not unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers doctrine set forth in Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

The court, however, affirmed the judgments. The court first found that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants performed nude dances in such a manner as to make the conduct an obscene display within the meaning of the obscenity statute. The State of Tennessee was not required to present affirmative evidence of contemporary community standards or expert testimony that the acts complained of were &quot;obscene&quot; as defined in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-6-1101(5). Although corporations could be fined under the statute while individuals could be incarcerated, the court found that there existed a rational basis for the different treatment of corporations and individuals; corporations could not be incarcerated, but individuals could. The statute was not unconstitutional for its different punishment for different classes of &quot;people.&quot; Finally, there was no reversible error in the admission of the diagram of the club in which the acts were performed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was no competent evidence tending to prove that defendant was so intoxicated that he was unable to form the specific intent necessary to commit the crimes, noting that expert testimony concerning defendant's medical history was not probative on the issue in the absence of corroboration. The court rejected defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 33-709, which required the trial court to instruct the jury on the issue of judicial hospitalization. The court rejected defendant's contention that he was denied his right to a fair trial because the jury considered defendant's possible parole during its deliberations, noting that the trial court had promptly instructed the jury to disregard the issue and that defendant failed to rebut the presumption that the jury followed the trial court's instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were charged with the obscenity offenses. At trial they offered the testimony of a clinical psychologist, who testified that he would classify nothing as obscene that was found in an adult bookstore and that the material had scientific value for the treatment of sexual disorders and in teaching courses in human sexuality. At the close of trial, the trial court instructed the jury on &sect; 39-6-1117, which exempted certain entities and persons from the obscenity statute. After defendants' conviction, they argued that the instruction was erroneous. The court affirmed, holding that the psychologist's testimony warranted the charge. The use made of similar materials for education and scientific purposes was authorized under the exemption statute. Therefore, it was relevant for the jury to be apprised that the scientific uses postulated by the psychologist were given specific protection from prosecution. The instruction provided an appropriate guideline for the jury in examining whether the material had protected uses or whether their sale was unprotected commercial exploitation of obscene material.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that the jury had the papers for that charge as well and sent the jury back for further deliberations. Affirming, the court concluded that defendant was properly convicted on all the charges. The trial court correctly refused to permit a juror to testify that the jury might have returned different verdicts if they had known about the lesser offenses because a juror could not impeach the verdict based on the jury's internal deliberative process. Additionally, the jury had been instructed on the lesser offenses of simple rape and simple kidnapping. The aggravating circumstance of the aggravated kidnapping charge was explained to the jury.

Reversing, the court held that the amendment of the act in question did not change the penalty provision of the act. The court noted that the punishment for the offense of being an habitual drug offender was the same in the previous and in the amended act. The court found that all persons who fell within the group of persons who had committed offenses that occurred prior to the amendment of the act would be subject to the same provisions as defendant in this case.

While modifying the fine imposed on the corporate defendant, it affirmed the remaining rulings below. After holding that it was bound by precedent to reject a blanket challenge to the constitutionality of &sect; 39-6-1101, et seq. under state law, the court ruled that statutory exemptions for certain individuals and organizations did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Due Process clauses because the exemption classifications were not arbitrary nor was the statute's scope unconstitutionally overbroad. The court held that the classification of Class A and Class B violators was constitutional and rejected a vagueness claim because the legislature was entitled to distinguish among violators. No merit was found in claims that the statute wrongly distinguished between movies and printed materials, that the application of the law to &quot;entities&quot; was too vague, or that the materials were not obscene.

The court stated that the Constitution placed no restrictions on the District Attorneys General in the prosecution of their duties, leaving it to the Legislature to enact laws designating those duties. The court found that because of the overwhelming increase in the duties of the Attorneys General as the result of the expanding crime rate and criminal activity, it was the purpose and intent of the Legislature in providing him with assistants that they serve in whatever capacity was necessary to the function of the office.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgments of a trial court (Tennessee) that found him guilty, in a bench trial, of distributing obscene materials in violation of Tenn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that he was convicted under an unconstitutional obscenity statute. Defendant further alleged that the definitions of &quot;obscene,&quot; &quot;patently offensive,&quot; and other descriptive words in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;39-6-1101 were unconstitutionally vague, and that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-6-1104(e)(1) improperly assessed him with the burden of proof because in order to avoid a mandatory jail term, it required him to show that he did not receive 25 percent of his inventory of sales during a given 24-hour period from the sale of obscene materials. Defendant further maintained that the State did not prove that the materials he sold were obscene, and that he was entrapped. The court affirmed, holding that there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant of distributing obscene materials and of selling a gambling device. The court stated that defendant was not entrapped because he voluntarily revealed the films in his possession and sold them to the undercover government agent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of a trial court (Tennessee) convicting him, following a jury trial, of burglary in the second degree and of being an habitual criminal. The punishment set on the burglary conviction was not less than three nor more than three years in the State penitentiary. After the bifurcated hearing on the habitual criminal count, the punishment was enhanced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. The victim testified that on the morning of the burglary she left the family residence and locked the doors because no one was at home. She returned later that afternoon and observed a pane of glass missing from the front door. She entered the house and found it in disarray with several items missing. The police recovered part of the property. A detective testified that he had talked with defendant two weeks after the burglary. Defendant admitted that he went to the victim's residence and removed a pane of glass from the front door. He admitted that he took property from the house which he placed in a bag and hid in the woods. The court held that evidence of defendant's guilt was plain and uncontradicted. It was more than sufficient upon which a rational trier of fact could be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of defendant's guilt. Defendant also argued that the habitual criminal statute, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2801, was unconstitutional. The court rejected the argument, ruling that the statute did not punish one for his status as a habitual criminal, but provided for enhanced punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged both the application and constitutionality of the Tennessee Rape Shield Statute, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2445 (Supp. 1981). Defendant contended that because he raised the issue of consent in a jury-out hearing, the trial judge erred in denying him a hearing pursuant to &sect; 40-2445 so that he could question the victim about any prior consensual sexual activity on her part. He further argued that by limiting the scope of cross-examination, &sect; 40-2445 operated so as to deprive him of his confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment. The court held that defendant's claims were without merit. As a matter of law, consent was required to be an issue before a jury-out hearing was required on the question of a victim's prior consensual sexual activity. As consent was not an issue, the trial court properly denied the defendant's requests for a &sect; 40-2445 hearing. As any evidence about the victim's previous consensual sexual history would have been totally immaterial, defendant was not denied any right of confrontation by the denial of his request. Defendant was also not entitled to an advance ruling on the use of any prior convictions for impeachment purposes.</SPAN></P>

The court noted on review that several other states had held that a trial judge should declare a mistrial in the event the jury was unable to reach a verdict in the habitual offender phase of a case brought under statutes similar to Tennessee's and should retry only the habitual offender charge before another jury. The court agreed with that course and held that the trial judge appropriately followed the procedure. Defendant conceded that the habitual offender act was previously held to be constitutional. Defendant argued that the law should be changed. The court explained that the courts were not the proper bodies to change valid legislative enactments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions of being habitual drug offenders, and the court agreed. However, the court concluded that because of the restrictive language contained in the habitual drug offender statute, the jury's failure to report a verdict on the fourth and fifth counts did not operate as a verdict of acquittal on those charges, and a remand for trial on those counts was in order. Of the six drug law violations alleged as overt acts, the proof established defendants' guilt only as to three of those violations. Since Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 52-1432(d)(1) (Supp.1981) required proof of five violations before one could be guilty of being an habitual drug offender, the court reversed defendants' convictions and dismissed the count charging the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of a trial court (Tennessee) that was entered upon his convictions for first-degree burglary with a firearm and assault with intent to commit sexual battery. For the convictions, he was sentenced respectively to 10 to 15 years and 1 to 3 years in the state penitentiary, with no designation that the sentences were to run consecutively. Thus, the sentences were to be concurrently served.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a home invasion, defendant robbed and attempted to sexually assault the victim. Because he was a neighbor, both the victim and the neighbor's house to which she ran for assistance recognized defendant. On appeal, he raised challenges to the evidence, the constitutionality of the statute proscribing assault with intent to commit sexual battery, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3707(b), and the trial court's submission to the jury of the crime of first-degree burglary with the commission of a firearm when the indictment charged first-degree burglary. In affirming the assault conviction, the court held that the evidence more than met the minimum standard required by Tenn. R. App. P. 13(e) to support a verdict and that &sect; 39-3707(b) met the constitutional requirement of specificity as it required no guessing or speculation as to its meaning. However, Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 required that an indictment state the nature and cause of the accusation. The failure of the instant indictment to notify defendant that he would have to defend against a charge of possessing a firearm during the burglary required reducing his conviction to first-degree burglary, with a concomitant sentence reduction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the assault to commit sexual battery conviction, reduced the first-degree burglary with possession of a firearm conviction to first-degree burglary, and modified the relevant sentence to 5 years' imprisonment, with the State's consent. As an alternative to the State's consent, the court ordered a retrial for the purpose of fixing the punishment for first-degree burglary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant provided marijuana and Quaaludes to his friend, who then sold the drugs to an undercover officer. Defendant admitted providing the drugs to his friend, but asserted that he had not made a profit on the sales and that he was not involved in a conspiracy with his friend to sell the drugs. He was charged with violating &sect; 52-1432(d), which defined a habitual drug offender as one who engaged in the protracted and repeated violations of the drugs laws either personally or through another with whom he had conspired on three or more occasions. Under &sect; 52-1432(d), a conspiracy was not required for a violation. Defendant's indictment alleged that he had conspired with his friend and listed the three sales to the undercover agent. The evidence against him consisted of the testimony of his friend, which was corroborated by the undercover agent. The court found no merit in the constitutional challenge because the Supreme Court of Tennessee had upheld the statute as constitutional. It also found the evidence sufficient to support defendant's conviction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was separated from his wife. He entered the wife's residence and shot her in the back, her cheek, and the top of her head. As a result of the shooting, the wife was permanently blinded in one eye.

Whether or not there was sufficient provocation to reduce the crime from assault with the intent to commit first-degree murder to assault with the intent to commit voluntary manslaughter was for the jury to determine. The enhancement of defendant's sentence was proper pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-4914. Section 39-4914 enhanced a sentence by five years if a firearm was used during the commission of a felony. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-604(b) provided harsher penalties for assault when there was bodily injury to the victim. The imposition of the enhancement pursuant to Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of the crimes based on evidence, particularly the testimony of the victims, that he committed various sexual acts on them. The court reversed the convictions for fellatio and anal intercourse on double jeopardy grounds because it was unclear upon what act of penetration the jury found defendant guilty of first-degree sexual conduct. However, the incest convictions could stand with the convictions for first-degree sexual conduct without violating the double jeopardy provisions. Moreover, both convictions of first-degree sexual conduct, and the two incest convictions, could stand as they were separate crimes against different victims. Furthermore, the criminal sexual conduct statute was not unconstitutionally vague. Moreover, because defendant's prosecution was commenced by presentments and not by an arrest warrant, he was not entitled to a preliminary hearing. Furthermore, defendant's speedy trial rights were not violated because he did not ask for a speedy trial until five days before the commencement of his trial, and, on the morning of trial, he moved for a continuance. Defendant sought delay, and there was no showing of prejudice from the delay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed and dismissed the convictions for fellatio and anal intercourse and affirmed the convictions for criminal sexual conduct in the first degree and incest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was found guilty of first-degree murder. On appeal, the court found that the evidence supported the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. The court noted that defendant made a statement he &quot;would take care of it himself,&quot; that he sat in a vehicle for some time near the scene of the shooting, and that the bullet entered the body from an angle indicating that defendant fired the shot from the side, which belied his argument of self-defense. Defendant argued that he was denied discovery. The court disagreed, finding that all the elements complained of were either produced or discussed at the preliminary hearing. Defendant also argued that the State of Tennessee erroneously referred to his statement as a confession. The court found that such error occurred but held that it was harmless because, when defendant objected, the prosecutor stated that it was up to the jury to determine whether it was or was not a confession. Defendant contended that the application of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-4914 was unconstitutional. The court held that there was no error because the offense of using a firearm to commit a felony was not a lesser-included offense of murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decisions of the Criminal Court of Shelby County, Division VIII (Tennessee), which entered jury verdicts convicting him of aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery and imposed an enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of forcing the victims, a credit union manager and her daughter, to drive at gunpoint to a credit union and open a safe. Thereafter, a jury found defendant guilty of aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery. On appeal, the court held that there was abundant evidence upon which a rational jury could be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of defendant's guilt. Further, a proper foundation was not laid for a question propounded to a police officer because the victim's attention was not directed to a particular conversation with police officers, nor were any contradictory words quoted, nor was her memory refreshed. Thus, the objection to defense counsel's question was properly sustained. Moreover, defendant's sentences were within the range of punishment fixed by law and were in no way indicative of passion or prejudice. Finally, the Class X Felonies Act of 1979, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-5401 to 39-5404, did not deny equal protection of the law because the distinction between Class X crimes and other crimes was rational and reasonable. The fact that pretrial diversions were not authorized for Class X crimes did not render the Act violative of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and the victim were involved in an altercation, and defendant shot and killed the victim. Upon his conviction, defendant claimed that the trial judge improperly commented on the evidence. The court held that the comments were not prejudicial. Next, there was no merit to defendant's claim that the trial court erred in allowing the State to retrieve a statement provided to defense counsel. The original document was never submitted to defense counsel, and the administration of the procedural rule, Tenn. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(E), was within the discretion of the trial court. As to defendant's attack on Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-4914, regarding penalties for the use of firearms or explosives in committing or escaping from a felony, the court held that the jury was properly instructed under the statute and that the verdict was within its bounds. The court then ruled that a 10-year-old witness was competent to testify because she demonstrated an excellent ability to recall and articulate the events. Finally, defendant's convictions were proper, as it was not necessary to prove that he was carrying a pistol in violation of the law in order to make out the charge of homicide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed her conviction by a trial court of Sevier County (Tennessee) for possession of unstamped alcohol, possession of stamped alcoholic beverages for resale and possession of alcoholic beverages for resale without a proper permit or license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Much of the evidence that was the basis of defendant's conviction was a quantity of alcoholic beverages seized by officers pursuant to a search warrant issued by an individual who was purportedly appointed a Judicial Commissioner by the quarterly county court pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-120. Defendant insisted that &sect; 40-120 was unconstitutional in that it created an &quot;inferior court&quot; under Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1 and therefore violated Tenn. Const. art. VI, &sect; 4. The State argued that &sect; 40-120 created a &quot;corporation court.&quot; The court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding that &sect; 40-120 created a &quot;magistrate.&quot; Commissioners were expressly designated a magistrates in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 38-301, 40-114, and 40-603. Further, magistrates were authorized by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; to issue search warrants. Moreover, the minutes of the county court's actions, although inartfully worded, clearly showed an intent to appoint the individual as a Commissioner and had to be so construed. In addition, the affidavit in support of the warrant, based on information of a reliable informant, was sufficient to enable the Commissioner to make a neutral and detached finding of probable cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of selling over 200 grams of methaqualone and of selling phencyclidine. He appealed his conviction for selling methaqualone, but the court affirmed. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to justify a rational trier of fact in finding defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Section 52-1432(c) was constitutional because it did not violate defendant's due process rights when it did not provide a bifurcated trial or set out standards for a jury to use in considering the length of punishment to impose. Section 52-1432(c) did not violate equal protection principles because a compelling state interest was served by its distinction between major and minor drug traffickers. The possible imposition of a life sentence for a large-scale narcotics violation was not cruel and unusual punishment. The Class X Felonies Act of 1979, 1979 Tenn. Pub. Acts 318, was not unconstitutional. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 52-1410 did not constitute an improper delegation of power by the legislature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants' marijuana field was found while officers were flying over land looking for stripped cars, moonshine stills, and patches of marijuana. Seven or eight tons of marijuana was found. The court found that helicopter searches did not violate the U.S. Const. amend. IV or Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 7 because the law enforcement officers were in a place they had a right to be and as a result thereof observed criminal activity. Thus, the open view exception applied and the observation of the officers did not constitute a search. There was no conflict in the same attorney representing all three defendants because the issue was not raised at trial. The court concluded that defendants were not indigent and chose to retain the same attorney. The court affirmed the convictions for manufacturing marijuana, but reversed the possession conviction because the possession with intent to sell count was necessarily included in the manufacturing count.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant entered guilty pleas to five indictments charging violations of Tenn.

Subsequently, defendant moved to withdraw his guilty pleas and prayed in the alternative for post-conviction relief on the ground that &sect; 48-1644(B) was unconstitutional. The trial judge found the statute to be unconstitutional and entered judgments vacating the previously-entered judgments of conviction. The State appealed, and the court reversed. Although the state supreme court found, in an intervening decision, that the last paragraph of &sect; 48-1644(B)(ii) was unconstitutional, defendant also had entered a guilty plea to the second count of the indictment, which charged a violation of &sect; 48-1644(B)(i) and to indictments charging violation of the section of the statute that was not harnessed by an unconstitutional infirmity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants appealed the decision from a trial court (Tennessee), which convicted both defendants for armed robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two suspects robbed a restaurant and tried to get away on a motorcycle. Defendant one alleged that he was beaten by police to obtain a written confession and denied an attorney. Concern that the confession was made while injured following a motorcycle accident and after the use of ammonia to revive defendant one, the court granted a motion to suppress. However, defendant made an oral statement to police after the written statement in which defendant admitted the facts of the first statement. On appeal, the court favored defendant one but not defendant two. While an inadmissible first statement did not always taint a second, in the case at bar, the oral statement made five days after the illegal confession tainted the second statement under the &quot;cat out of the bag&quot; theory. Because of the illegal confession, the interlocking confession of defendant two could not be used against defendant one. As for defendant two, there was sufficient evidence that he was one of the men on the motorcycle. A life sentence was not cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence of defendant two. The court reversed and remanded the conviction of defendant one for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Later, defendant, during a visitation, took the child out of state and was found a month later by a private investigator. The trial court convicted defendant of kidnapping. On defendant's appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that &sect; 39-2602 applied to defendant as a parent, that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, that the words of common usage were interpreted by the trial court by their natural and ordinary meaning to apply to parents, and that defendant had lied to the father about her plans and location. Moreover, the trial court had jurisdiction pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-109. The court properly exercised its discretion over the cross-examination of witnesses and properly admitted evidence of a prior conviction for shoplifting as relevant to show dishonest conduct pursuant to Tenn.

The court affirmed, holding that any reasonable trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further held that defendant waived issues regarding the indictment, the failure to charge a lesser included offense, an alleged violation of the right to remain silent, and evidence of prior convictions because there were no contemporaneous objections, and they were not presented in the motion for new trial. The court noted that defendant conceded that the habitual criminal statute was not unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Lewis County Court (Tennessee), which convicted him of incest-related charges. Defendant, who was the member of a large commune, argued that the failure of the grand jury that indicted him and the jury panel from his trial jury was selected to contain the names of members of his commune violated his Equal Protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on two incest-related charges. Defendant appealed, arguing that the jury selection procedures in the county resulted in the systematic exclusion of members of his commune, an identifiable group in the community, from grand jury and jury lists in violation of his rights under the Due Process Clause. The court held that the systematic exclusion of members of defendant's commune from jury lists violated defendant's rights under the Due Process Clause and U.S. Const. amend. VI to be indicted and tried by a jury reflecting a fair cross-section of the community. Under U.S. Const. VI and the Due Process Clause, juries must have been drawn from a source fairly representative of the community. Defendant showed that the members of the commune were distinctive, representation of the commune members in venires was not fair and reasonable in relation to the numbers of such persons in the community, and this underrepresentation was due to the systematic exclusion of the commune members in the jury selection process. The State then failed in its burden of rebutting defendant's presumption of unconstitutional action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court held that the district attorney could deny defendant the opportunity to participate in the diversion program because to have permitted diversion and possible expungement upon completion of the program would have created a recording problem that would have frustrated the recidivist provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 55-10-601 et seq. if defendant were to have been arrested for a subsequent D.U.I. offense. The trial court also concluded that &quot;some punishment&quot; was necessary in D.U.I. cases because of their &quot;potential for violence&quot; and the need for deterrence. On appeal, however, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. Specifically, the court held that it had been for the legislature to determine which charges should have barred the participation of an accused in a pretrial diversion program, and which should not have barred such participation. As a result, the court held that the trial court infringed upon the legislative prerogative by ruling that pretrial diversion could never have been ordered in a D.U.I. case. Lastly, the court noted that the record failed to show any indication of violence connected with the offense for which defendant was indicted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The convictions grew out of the armed kidnapping and subsequent robbery of a routeman for a vendor as he returned to his van while servicing a cigarette machine. The trial court did not err by failing to dismiss the indictments for the State's alleged failure to strictly comply with the Interstate Compact on Detainers, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-3901 et seq., because the request form that defendant signed was legally effective even though all of the blanks were not filled in. A minimal delay of 17 days chargeable to the prosecution did not amount to the denial of a speedy trial under the Compact. There was no constitutional right to counsel at the early state of a Compact case. While the temporary custody request did not list the habitual criminal counts from defendant's indictment, this did not void the transfer because habitual criminality was not an offense but a &quot;status.&quot; It would not have been unduly burdensome for defendant to travel to the crime laboratory to examine the fingerprint evidence and interview a prospective expert witness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot and killed the victim after she found him in the bedroom of his new girlfriend's house. Defendant testified that she feared for her life when she went to the house and that the victim was in the habit of carrying a pistol. She thought he was reaching for his gun. Police testified that no weapons were found anywhere in the girlfriend's house or in the victim's car. The evidence showed that defendant went armed to the house and shot the victim as he stood naked. The jury obviously endorsed the State's theory. The evidence was sufficient to convict her. The use of the weapon provided the element of malice necessary for a conviction for second degree murder. The court rejected defendant's bald assertion in her second issue that the punishment was excessive. The sentences were within the statutory limits. The court found no conflict between Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-4914, which prohibited suspension of a penalty when a firearm was used in the commission of a felony, and Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2901, which permitted suspension of a sentence.

Defendant's constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him overcame the statutory protection of the juveniles. Cross-examination of the sister should have been permitted. A police lieutenant should not have been permitted to testify about his handwritten memoranda because the requirements of the past recollection recorded exception to the hearsay rule were not met.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant owned three horses found positive for swamp fever.

Defendant did not dispute that he refused to comply with the regulation. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. There was abundant evidence that the regulation was responsive to the evil sought to be controlled or eliminated by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 44-407 and that the control measures established by the regulation were reasonable. Quarantine of infected horses was effective in preventing spread of the disease, and the use of a brand was necessary to prevent violation of the quarantine and the introduction of infected animals into commerce. Also, freeze branding the neck of his horses did not deprive defendant of his property and the use thereof without compensation or due process of law. The prevention of introducing the diseased animals into commerce carried out the legislative mandate for the Commissioner to promulgate regulations against the spread and for the suppression of any communicable disease.

The trial court ordered defendant returned to custody after it determined that it did not have authority to grant probation to defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment upon finding that defendant was not eligible for probation. The record showed that defendant pled guilty to three violations of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 52-1432(a)(1)(B), each of which was committed at different times and on separate occasions and each of which constituted a separate conviction. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2901 specifically prohibited the trial court from granting defendant probation because he had been found guilty of a second or subsequent violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 52-1432(a)(1)(B). Because the trial court had no statutory authority to grant probation in the first instance, its order purporting to grant it was void. Therefore, the trial court was fully authorized to order defendant returned to custody.</SPAN></P>

Three days before defendant's trial, the other man appeared in court on a motion as to his sentence, and the State served him with a subpoena to testify at defendant's trial. On the morning of trial, defendant moved for a continuance for his lack of notice that this accomplice's testimony would be offered against him. The court held that: (1) defendant had notice long before the trial court proceedings that the accomplice's testimony was available, and thus, he was not prejudiced by the trial court's refusal of his motion for a continuance; (2) the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction of second degree burglary; and (3) it was not necessary for the State to charge that the offense occurred in a motel room because defendant had notice that the crime with which he was charged occurred in a motel room.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of a criminal court (Tennessee), which convicted him of operating a motor vehicle in violation of the Motor Vehicle Habitual Offenders Act, Tenn.

Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motions to dismiss and to suppress evidence of an order finding him to be a habitual offender, insufficiency of the evidence, and that the punishment prescribed was cruel and inhuman.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A petition was filed pursuant to the Motor Vehicle Habitual Offenders Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-2101, et seq., against defendant. Pursuant to a show cause hearing, he was found to be and was forbidden to operate a vehicle in the State. A few months later, he was arrested and charged on a warrant with driving while influenced: a fourth offense in six years and third in three years. Defendant waived a jury trial and his right to trial only on indictment or presentment. He was tried on the warrant. As a result, a county grand jury returned a presentment charging him with operating a motor vehicle while restrictions were in effect, violating Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-2116. The court affirmed, finding that Tenn. R. Crim. P. 8(a) required no mandatory joinder because it did not apply to charges brought on a warrant and never presented to a grand jury. Further, the habitual offender charge was never within the trial court's jurisdiction. The habitual offender proceedings, civil in nature, were not null and void for lack of counsel. Lastly, the punishment received under the Act was not so grossly out of proportion to the severity of the offense as to constitute cruel and inhuman punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed from a judgment of the Criminal Court of Greene County (Tennessee), which granted defendant a delayed appeal from the court's judgment affirming his conviction for armed robbery. His petition for post-conviction relief was granted with regard to his contention that his counsel unilaterally terminated the appellate process without his knowledge or consent after assuring him that the case would be taken to the Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's counsel was not present at the post-conviction hearing. Defendant testified that counsel had promised to apply to the Supreme Court for certiorari and that he did not learn that counsel had not done so until the time for filing had expired. The trial court allowed defendant 90 days in which to file a delayed appeal. On appeal, the court agreed with the State that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to vacate the judgment of the court in prior proceedings involving this defendant and to grant a delayed petition for writ of certiorari. Although Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-3820 authorized a trial judge to grant a delayed appeal in the nature of a writ of error from an original conviction when a prisoner could show that his right to appeal was denied in violation of his constitutional rights, that section did not address deprivation of a right to apply to the Supreme Court for certiorari. However, because the trial court found that defendant was deprived of a constitutional right, the court granted the relief that defendant sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed that part of the trial court's judgment that granted a delayed appeal. The court then exercised its power to grant the delayed appeal by vacating and immediately reinstating its prior judgment affirming defendant's conviction for armed robbery. It took that action for the sole purpose of starting anew the time for which defendant could petition the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the trial judge was in error not to allow defendant's counsel to complete the record on this point, but that counsel did not except to the trial judge's ruling. Also, the court found that defendant did not demonstrate the loss of any trial tactic or fundamental right as a result of this miscarriage of negotiations.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the search and seizure of items from defendant's residence was not illegal because (1) the warrant contained a careful and detailed description of the premises to be searched and the kinds of items to be seized; and (2) there was no prohibition against the seizure of other property not specifically mentioned in a valid warrant if it was relevant to the crime suggested by the warrant. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to continue based on the absence of a defense witness because the motion was not accompanied by an affidavit specifying the substance of the witness's proposed testimony, nor was there any representation concerning it. The trial court did not err in ordering some of the sentences to be served consecutively because the record amply demonstrated a four- or five-year course of dealing by defendant that made him a persistent and repeated offender, who derived most of his livelihood from the sexual exploitation of these children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, defendant argued that the evidence did not show that the 13-year-old girl was raped, that there was no proof of penetration, and that the offense of crime against nature also required penetration and none was shown. He also argued that he should not have been convicted of the three charges because they were all part of the same transaction. The court rejected his arguments, concluding that the victim's testimony as well as her examining doctor's testimony supported the conclusion that defendant penetrated her. Also, the court found that her testimony was ample on the elements of rape. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the trial court erred in dismissing his motion to suppress evidence. The court found that defendant was properly warned of his rights and had waived them, that he had accompanied the officers willingly to the police station, that he signed a statement denying any connection with the crimes, and that he was not in custody and was free to leave at any time.</SPAN></P>

They challenged the composition of the grand jury that indicted them and alleged that a search and seizure was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendants' convictions. It found that a new system was used to select a grand jury that indicted defendants in which the 10th person on the voter registration list was selected, his name was placed in a box, and cards for jurors were drawn from the box. The court found that the system was a racially neutral procedure and the racial composition of the grand jury that indicted defendants was not disproportionate. Further, any discrimination in the system used in prior years was immaterial. The court also found that the search warrant was not invalid because the agent testified at trial that the substances he observed appeared to be marijuana and LSD while his affidavit in support of the warrant stated that he observed marijuana and LSD in the residence, as the magistrate was aware that the affidavit was based on the officers identification by observation and did not assume that a chemical examination had been made of the material the officer saw in the residence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of assault with the intent to commit robbery with a deadly weapon. His conviction was affirmed. On grant of certiorari by the Tennessee Supreme Court, the case was consolidated with two others to resolve the validity of Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 163, &sect; 2 (1973), which was the last paragraph of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2707. The provision required that the trial court provide certain jury instructions in felony prosecutions. The Supreme Court declared the provision unconstitutional, but affirmed defendant's conviction. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief. The court rejected the inmate's argument that his conviction was void because it was an abridgement of a constitutional right. The inmate argued that the ruling only applied to his conviction, not his sentence. Further, the inmate argued that the Supreme Court had abrogated its prior decision. The court found that the Supreme Court had held that the jury instructions were error only as they pertained to the question of punishment. The court held that the Supreme Court had not abrogated its decision as it applied to the inmate's case.</SPAN></P>

He aided in the apprehension and arrest of a perpetrator on a burglary case. The perpetrator testified that defendant offered to fix the case for him in exchange for a van.

The bribery statute under which defendant was indicted, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-804, was not vague and not constitutionally infirm. Defendant was not denied the right to a speedy trial. There was no indication in the record that he ever asserted his right to a speedy trial. The trial court did not in admitting the tape recordings and transcripts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Criminal Court of Hamblen County (Tennessee) that convicted him of burglary and larceny and then, utilizing those offenses as triggering offenses, found that he was an habitual criminal, and sentenced him accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that it was error to deny his motion to dismiss the indictment because, in one of the five counts it contained, his middle initial was misstated. He also argued that the application of Tennessee's habitual criminal statutes constituted cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, opining that if a defendant was otherwise adequately identified, a mistake in or omission of his middle name or initial did not render an indictment or information insufficient. The court reasoned that the indictment gave defendant adequate notice that he should come to court prepared to defend himself on the habitual criminal charge. The court noted that under the Eighth Amendment, a sentence was not excessive and did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment when it did not involve the unnecessary wanton infliction of pain, and when it was not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime. The court found that defendant sentence was the enhanced punishment permitted for the crimes of which he was convicted and, as such, was not grossly out of proportion to those crimes.</SPAN></P>

The evidence showed that defendant offered the prosecutrix a ride when he saw her waiting for a bus. She accepted but defendant drove her to an apartment where the attack took place, then defendant drove the prosecutrix to her destination. An examination of the prosecutrix did not reveal evidence of an attack. The prosecutrix identified defendant and he surrendered to the police. Though the evidence at trial was conflicting, the court found that the jury verdict should not be disturbed. Defendant challenged a jury instruction but that challenge was waived by defendant's failure to raise it in a motion for a new trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction, but reduced his penalty to 10 years' imprisonment based on a jury instruction error, with the proviso that in the absence of the prosecution's consent, the case was to be retried solely on the issue of punishment. The prosecution declined to accept the sentence reduction. Accordingly, the case was retried before a new jury on the issue of punishment. Defendant's sentence was set at 21 years' imprisonment. Defendant claimed on appeal that the retrial violated his rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause of U.S. Const. amend. V. The court rejected defendant's double jeopardy claim, concluding that the resentencing did not constitute double punishment and, therefore, that there was no violation of defendant's rights under either the Fifth Amendment or Tenn. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10. The court noted that defendant was entitled to credit for the time he served on the original sentence.

Defendant took the card and left the store when the clerk informed him that the card was reported stolen. Defendant was later convicted of fraudulent use of a credit card. On appeal, he challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 39-1954 and certain jury instructions. The court affirmed, finding that the penalty provision of &sect; 39-1954 was not unconstitutionally vague and that any defects in the caption of 1968 Tenn. Pub. Acts 583, which amended the act that created the offense of fraudulent use of a credit card, were cured by the codification of the offense in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1954. Further, the court found that the criminal court did not err in refusing to charge the jury on the offense of an attempt to commit a felony because an attempt to fraudulently obtain goods was a violation of &sect; 39-1954 and the punishment was the same for an attempt as for the actual obtaining of property.

Code Ann. &sect; 40-2801. Defendant argued that the two-count indictment should have been quashed because the first count charging him with burglary was not signed by the grand jury foreman, and it showed that it was returned in the March 1976 term while the second count charging him as a habitual criminal was returned in the April 1976 term. Defendant also argued that the jury should have been instructed that they did not have to apply the statutory punishment under &sect; 40-2801 if they found the punishment to be harsh. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court found that the incorrect term of court at the top of the indictment was immaterial and did not invalidate the indictment where the caption shoed the term at which the indictment was preferred. Defendant's requested jury instruction was erroneous and contrary to the punishment provisions of the Habitual Criminal Act, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2801. The trial court properly rejected defendant's request.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated appeal of two actions, defendant appealed the judgments of the Criminal Court of Shelby County, which, following jury trials, convicted him of third degree burglary in the first action and grand larceny in the second action. The trial court imposed a sentence of 6-10 years for burglary. The second jury found defendant to be a habitual criminal, and his sentence for grand larceny of 6-10 years was enhances to a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the habitual criminal statute, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2806, the validity of imposing a life sentence for recidivism at the second trial, and the correctness of the trial court's jury instructions. On appeal, the court found that &sect; 40-2806 did not violate the due process or equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions and that its imposition did not result in cruel and unusual punishment. Selective enforcement of the statute was not unconstitutional. Thus, the trial court committed no error in refusing to order pre-trial interrogatories to establish selective enforcement of the statute or in refusing to allow voir dire of prospective jurors about their predilections toward the imposition of the mandatory life sentence required by &sect; 40-2806. The action of the first jury, which found that he was not a habitual criminal, did not acquit defendant of the underlying prior convictions and did not bar the enumeration of those convictions in the second trial. There was no double jeopardy violation. Finally, the effect of a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity was not a proper consideration for the jury.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict and that the jury obviously determined that the prosecutrix's testimony was more credible than defendant's. However, the court found that the trial court did err in refusing to permit defendant to cross-examine the prosecutrix about the pregnancy because the evidence of pregnancy was relevant as proof of intercourse and as a basis for the State's theory of the motivation underlying the alleged attempt to suppress or destroy evidence by setting fire to the house and blocking the passage of the prosecutrix.

Moreover, the evidence established that the robbers assaulted both of the women, tied them up, and took various items of property from their apartment. Both victims identified defendant as one of the robbers. Moreover, other evidence connected defendant to the get-away vehicle. After defendant was convicted of the robberies and sentenced, he appealed. On appeal, defendant, a habitual offender, contended that trial court erred when it sentenced him to two consecutive life sentences. The court noted that in the habitual criminal phase of the trial, proof was introduced that established that defendant had been previously convicted of in excess of 15 felonies. Suffice it to say, the court held that the record fully supported defendant's guilt of the two present armed robbery offenses as well as the jury's finding of habitual criminality on his part. Moreover, the court held that the habitual offender statute did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment or a violation of defendant's rights against double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the trial court (Tennessee), which refused to hear her petition for probation. Appellant pled guilty to five offenses of selling heroin and received a penitentiary sentence of not less than five years nor more than 10 years for each offense and that the sentences were to be served concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's five convictions for selling heroin were predicated upon her violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 52-1432(a)(1)(A) (1977), which provided a minimum penitentiary punishment of not less than five years and a maximum punishment of not more than 15 years. Two of defendant's offenses occurred on one date, two on another, and one on another. The court found that Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2901 (Supp. 1976) listed certain categories of defendants who are not eligible for probation consideration and that one was regarding a defendant who had been convicted of two or more felonies for which the maximum sentence provided by law exceed 10 years confinement in the state penitentiary. The court rejected defendant's contention that her multiple convictions occurred on the same day and should have been treated as a single conviction thereby making her eligible to apply for probation under &sect; 40-2901. The court disagreed and held that the trial court correctly interpreted &sect; 40-2901 as depriving it of jurisdiction to entertain defendant's petition because defendant's convictions were on separate indictments for separate offenses, committed at different times, and on separate occasions.</SPAN></P>

He called the police and when they arrived at the pool hall, the husband entered the pool hall with the officers and identified defendant. The husband later identified defendant in the courtroom. Defendant argued that the in-court identification of him was based on an improper lineup and was therefore not admissible. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, opining that the victim's identification of defendant at the pool hall did not constitute an impermissible lineup so as to make the identification unduly suggestive or give rise to any substantial likelihood of irrepressible misidentification. The court reasoned that the victim's identification was based upon his observation of defendant at the time the crime was being committed, that there was no evidence that the identification by the victim at the pool hall was rigged or planned, and that the identification at the pool hall did not constitute a lineup.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that it was error to permit testimony concerning his confession because the police violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and his Sixth Amendment right to counsel in obtaining the confession.

The court found that the evidence showed conclusively that defendant was advised of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning and that, by his own admission, he asked only to be allowed to consult with his minister. The court noted that the police immediately carried out by his request and that, as a result, defendant's minister was present during the interrogation that resulted in defendant's confession. With respect to defendant's Sixth Amendment right, the court reasoned that while it was true that defendant's attorney had requested that no statement be taken from his client, there was no agreement that the police would forego questioning in the attorney's absence or that defendant would be unable to waive his right to have counsel present during questioning.</SPAN></P>

The testimony was corroborative of other evidence that placed defendant at a scene of a violent, wanton, and grossly executed homicide committed in the course of a robbery. It showed defendant's state of mind and intent immediately preceding, and, subsequent to, the actual occurrence of the crime. Holding as the court did that the testimony was admissible under exceptions other than the tacit admission exception to the hearsay rule, taking the witness's testimony in conjunction with other convincing evidence in the record, it affirmatively appearing that defendant heard and fully understood the remarks made by co-defendant which were made under circumstances affording him the opportunity to register denial, there having been no request for any precautionary jury instructions, the court rejected the suggestion that such an instruction was called for.</SPAN></P>

The court found that, in addition to defendant two's admission to the homicide and the means by which it was accomplished, there was a great mass of evidence pointing directly to both defendants. The court ruled that the elements of premeditation, deliberation, and malice could have properly been inferred from the circumstances surrounding the homicide and the fact that it was accomplished with a deadly weapon. The court noted that the capital punishment statute mandating death by electrocution had been declared unconstitutional.

An hour after leaving the gas station, defendant entered a truck stop, walked to a table where a sheriff's deputy was sitting, disarmed the deputy, and fired a fatal shot into the deputy's neck. A jury found defendant guilty of first-degree murder in violation of &sect; 39-2402(2)(c). On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, holding that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that defendant had committed a willful, deliberate, and malicious killing of a peace officer. While at the gas station, defendant experienced a desire to kill a police officer, he took the gun in the truck stop with him, and after seeing the deputy, purposely pointed his gun to the back of the deputy's neck and fired. The evidence also supported a finding that defendant knew that the victim was an on duty police officer acting during the course of his employment because the victim was dressed in full uniform, he was wearing a badge, and he was armed with a pistol.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the evidence preponderated against the finding of premeditation and deliberation, and therefore, the guilty verdict of murder in the first degree was not justified. On appeal, the court found abundant evidence in the record supporting the jury verdict finding defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, including the elements of deliberation and premeditation. The court also held that expert witnesses could compare authenticated specimens of handwriting with disputed writings to determine whether the disputed writing had been forged, and, if the expert concluded that the document was a forgery, the expert could compare it with authenticated writings to determine the identity of the person who forged it. The expert's testimony in both instances was admissible in evidence to prove not only that the document was a forgery but the identity of the forger. The court also held that defendant's feeling of animosity towards his son was relevant in view of defendant's statement to the police officers that he saw his son kill his mother. It was also relevant that defendant and the victim were in disagreement about the victim's Social Security checks.</SPAN></P>

Defendant testified in his own behalf and admitted selling the tablets to the undercover agent. However, he denied receiving $ 65.00 for them. Defendant was convicted of the charge. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court had not abused its discretion in allowing the State's toxicologist to testify as an expert because the witness had received a degree in chemistry and had been working for the toxicology laboratory at a university for two years. Further, the verdict was not contrary to the evidence and the law where defendant was guilty by his own testimony. Defendant's argument that he had not possessed the mens rea to commit the offense was overruled because the fact that the vendee of drugs was a &quot;friend&quot; of the vendor neither excused the sale nor lessened the degree of his offense.</SPAN></P>

The prosecution argued that the parole charge issue was not preserved for appeal. The court held that: (1) in light of Tenn.

Finally, the court held that &sect; 39-1916, declaring it to be a felony for any person to willfully and maliciously and falsely create the impression that said person has become deceased, was not unconstitutionally vague.

On appeal, the court affirmed as modified, holding that: (1) the evidence did not preponderate against the jury verdict and in favor of defendant's innocence; (2) the trial court's refusal to allow a continuance or delay in the trial for the purpose of securing other counsel did not constitute an abuse of discretion; (3) defendant's mental competency was never raised as an issue; (4) the trial court did not abuse its discretion regarding sequestration of the witnesses; (5) in light of recent caselaw, the trial court erred in instructing the jury with reference to parole statutes; and (6) the trial court erred in permitting trial counsel to withdraw from the case, but the error was harmless in light of appointed counsel's excellent representation on appeal. Because the jury was erroneously instructed regarding parole, the court reduced defendant's sentence to a maximum of three years in prison, with the State's consent.

The victim died from the gunshot wounds. Defendant was charged with first degree murder. A jury found him guilty of second degree murder. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the evidence adequately supported the verdict because there was no evidence of any provocation which legally could have reduced the degree of homicide to voluntary manslaughter. The jury weighed defendant's contention that the shooting was somehow accidental or unintentional and rejected his version of the facts, as was their prerogative. Further, defendant's argument that he had been denied his constitutional right to a fair trial was without merit because defendant failed to demonstrate that cognizable groups had been excluded from jury service, thereby making the jury panels unrepresentative for purposes of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a deputy sheriff who worked undercover. Another undercover officer informed the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations (TBI) that defendant had asked him if he was interested in making some money selling drugs. The TBI agents obtained several telephone calls and personal conversations between defendant and the officer wherein defendant discussed his plans to procure drugs to sell to the officer. The officer purchased drugs from defendant on two occasions. Defendant was arrested and convicted of selling schedule I drugs, delivering schedule I drugs, and possession for resale of a schedule II drug in violation of &sect; 52-1432. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant was not entitled to a directed verdict based on the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 52-1444(c), which provided law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties immunity from liability because the evidence showed that defendant sold the drugs for personal gain and not in connection with his official duties. Further, the trial court had properly determined that the evidence did not justify a jury charge concerning the &quot;casual exchange&quot; of a controlled substance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants one and two appealed the judgments of a trial court (Tennessee) that convicted them, in a jury trial, of possessing lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) with intent to sell, resulting in a sentence of imprisonment for not less than five nor more than 10 years, and possessing marihuana with intent to sell, resulting in imprisonment for not less than one year nor more than five years. The sentences were to be served concurrently.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants argued that the trial court erred in overruling their motion for a directed verdict of acquittal, reasoning that defendant one being present did not necessarily mean that he was in possession of the controlled substances. In affirming, the court noted that the facts showed that defendant one was in the apartment with an opportunity to be in control of the premises, LSD and marihuana were found in his possession and on the premises, and he had given the apartment as his address when placed in custody. Those facts were more than adequate to support the jury's inference of possession with the intent to sell. As to defendant two, the jury accredited the circumstances that he had been paying the bill for the use of the utilities at the apartment and had given the apartment as his address when arrested. Those facts and circumstances were sufficient to create a presumption that, as the owner of the premises, defendant two had control over or possession of the contraband with the intent to sell. The court held that the statutory elements of the two offenses were different, and neither offense was included within the other. Under that rationale, the two judgments could stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a joint trial with a co-defendant, defendant was convicted in the Criminal Court of Shelby County, Division VI (Tennessee) for second degree burglary. Sentence was set at not less than five nor more than 10 years in a penitentiary. Defendant appealed. The co-defendant was convicted of receiving stolen property, was given three years, and did not appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A home was burglarized. Shortly thereafter a police officer questioned defendant and discovered the stolen goods in the trunk of a car. The goods had not yet been reported stolen, so defendant was not arrested, but a description of the items and defendant's name was written down. The burglary was reported, and defendant was arrested. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient because defendant did not satisfactorily explain why, within a matter of hours after the burglary, defendant had a substantial amount of the stolen property in the trunk of his automobile. The co-defendant's confession, which implicated defendant, was admissible because defendant's counsel elicited that statement on cross-examination. Severance was not sought, so any error was harmless. Defendant's contention that trial court erred in charging the jury on certain statutes failed because it was not stated with the specificity required by Tenn. Sup. Ct. R. 14(5), Tenn. Ct. App. R. 14(5). The evidence of the information obtained in the initial search of the car's trunk was admissible because it was obtained during a lawful consent search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted based on evidence that he robbed a liquor store at gunpoint and then shot a police officer while he was being apprehended. In affirming defendant's convictions, the court on appeal held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in trying the charges together. The cases were so intertwined that most of the evidence would have been admissible in each separate trial. Defendant was not entitled to a jury charge that he could be convicted of the lesser offense of attempting to commit a felony even though the final act constituting the felony had been completed because it was an incorrect statement of the law. The jury could not properly be charged to violate their oath and find defendant guilty of an attempt when the crime of robbery had been consummated. The trial court did not err by failing to give a charge concerning the eligibility for parole of one given a life sentence because pertinent parts of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2707 had recently been declared unconstitutional. A sentence of life imprisonment on the armed robbery conviction was not excessive. The sentence was a permissible punishment and warranted by the nature of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant attacked the validity of two prior convictions used to support the third burglary conviction culminating in the finding of appellant's habitual criminal status. The only attack upon the two supporting convictions was that their affirmance by the court upon direct appeal was not made the subject of a petition for certiorari to the Tennessee Supreme Court. He maintained that the convictions were facially void simply because petitions for certiorari were not filed. The court held that the two convictions were not void, or even voidable, for lack of two-tier review. The court observed that at most, given a following of the proper procedures and the facts to justify it, the convictions might still be reviewable by the supreme court. The court on appeal previously determined the validity of the trial judge's order that a sentence for the burglary conviction run consecutively to that given for an assault to commit murder. Accordingly, the question was considered previously determined under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-3812. Finally, the court rejected appellant's contention that the habitual criminal statutes were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Following an argument with the jailer about his brother's incarceration, defendant pushed and shoved the jailer and a radio dispatcher. They arrested defendant for disturbing the peace and found a loaded pistol during a search of his person. Defendant was carrying the weapon off-duty as allowed under a directive from his chief. The court held that defendant's conduct in the county jail was calculated to provoke violence or a violation of the law. Accordingly, the trial judge's judgment finding defendant guilty of disturbing the peace was sustained. Applying a strict construction of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-4902 in favor of defendant, the court rejected the State's contention that this statute, which exempted police officers from the law prohibiting the carrying dangerous weapons, was applicable only where those officers were within their territorial jurisdictions. The court ruled that the plain meaning of &sect; 39-4902 meant that the officer's regular duties and assignments were not to be considered in determining whether or not an officer was entitled to the benefit of this statute.</SPAN></P>

They confirmed that the victim was shot and killed at the time and place, and under the same circumstances as was related by defendant in his confession. There was also independent proof that corroborated other aspects of the story. The fact that none of the eyewitnesses could identify defendant was inconsequential. The court stated that when the corpus delicti was proven by independent evidence, defendant's free and voluntary confession sustained the conviction. The confession was properly admitted.

The officers testified and stated that defendant's speech was slurred, he smelled of intoxicants, and he exhibited all the classic signs of being under an intoxicant. Defendant argued that because his trial was originally set in the City Court of Memphis, that trial court had gained jurisdiction over his charges, and any further proceedings could be had only in that trial court. The court held that the technical record before it contained no indication of what, if anything, transpired in the City Court of Memphis. Therefore, the court found that it was unable to find that the City Court of Memphis ever had jurisdiction to try defendant. Any error was found harmless because of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. With regard to the assignment asserting evidentiary insufficiency, a guilty verdict by the jury, approved by the judge accredited the testimony of the State's witnesses and resolved all conflicts in testimony in favor of the theory of the State. Defendant had the burden of showing that the evidence preponderated in favor of his innocence. A review of the evidence convinced the court that he failed to sustain his burden.</SPAN></P>

Nor was there merit to a claim that the jury's verdict was uncertain. Even though the language of the verdict was not specific, the indictment adequately stated the charge under &sect; 39-605 and the verdict was sufficient. The court also approved the sentence, ruling that no prejudice resulted from the jury fixing a minimum as well as a maximum sentence; rejected claims that the statute was unconstitutional for protecting only females because males were protected from sexual abuse under other laws; upheld the admissibility of defendant's poems over claims that they were privileged; found no merit to an attack on the appointment and selection of jury commissioners; and overruled defendant's other claims.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the arrest warrant was issued without complying with the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3014.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A district attorney general filed a petition alleging that defendant was exhibiting two obscene films. Upon determining after an adversary hearing that the films were obscene, the criminal court enjoined their further exhibition in a judgment that was affirmed on appeal. A police officer gave defendant a written notice that an application for a criminal warrant for his exhibiting of the obscene films would be made four days later. A grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with exhibiting and displaying obscene motion picture films. After viewing the films, the jury applied the applicable contemporary community standards and determined that defendant was exhibited obscene material. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction by finding that the films were obscene and that the indictment, which was regular on its face, was valid without regard to whether there was a technical non-compliance with the required statutory notice. The provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3014 did not preclude a grand jury from exercising its inquisitorial powers to investigate and return indictments for violations of obscenity laws. The jury was properly charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner appealed an order of Circuit Court of Shelby County, Division Four (Tennessee) dismissing his request for post-conviction relief. Petitioner had claimed therein that the rape statute under which he was convicted, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-3701, was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause to the U.S. Constitution, but the circuit court had ruled to the contrary and dismissed his petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner claimed that the criminal court erred in dismissing his request for post-conviction relief. The crux of his appeal was that the rape statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause because it treated males and females differently. In specific, he argued that because the statutory definition provided that only a male could commit the offense of rape, the Equal Protection Clause was violated. The court affirmed the circuit court ruling in its entirety. Noting that the test was whether the sexual classification was reasonable and not arbitrary, and whether it rested upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons in similar circumstances were treated alike, the court held that the statute was constitutional. Because it was intended to protect women from unlawful forced sexual intercourse and possible resulting forced pregnancy and venereal disease, such protection was not only a legitimate state purpose but a state duty, and that the statutory classification was both reasonable and bore a fair and substantial relationship to the object of the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court denying post-conviction relief to petitioner and upholding the constitutionality of the rape statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State sought review of a decision of the Criminal Court of Sullivan County (Tennessee), which dismissed its petition to destroy appellee owner's pinball machines and directed the return of the pinball machines to the owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner had leased five pinball machines to two lessees. When the lessee of three of the machines pleaded guilty to possession of gambling devices, a violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2006, the machines were ordered destroyed. The other two machines were confiscated from the other lessee who was never prosecuted for possessing the machines. The court ruled that the trial court properly dismissed the State's petition because the statutory exemption of pinball machines from the definitions of &quot;gambling&quot; and &quot;gambling device&quot; contained in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2033(2) and (3) exempted pinball machines from being subject to destruction. Because pinball machines were excluded from these definitions, the court reasoned that they should have been excluded from all penal sanctions encompassed by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 39-2001 and 39-2037. The court concluded that the machines were seized by the State contrary to Tennessee law and that the lessee's plea of guilty should not have prevented the owner, who was not a party to that prosecution, from asserting the illegality of the seizure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was incarcerated at the Knox County Work Release Center pending parole that had been approved with his release date.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmates were convicted of the manufacture of marijuana, and their convictions were affirmed on direct appeal by the Tennessee Supreme Court. The trial court then denied their request for post-conviction relief, and the inmates appealed, first alleging they were prejudiced by pre-trial publicity. Specifically, they contended a television film of their arrest prejudiced them and the radio people misrepresented their life style. In affirming, the court noted that at trial, the inmates did not want to challenge any jurors, although their attorney challenged a number peremptorily. Furthermore, the trial judge found that the evidence failed to show that the inmates had not received a fair trial as a result of the alleged publicity. Also, there was no motion for a change of venue, and the instant proceeding was the first time the issue was raised. Next, the court agreed with the trial judge that, contrary to the inmate's argument, it was proper for the legislature to make manufacture of marijuana a felony and mere possession a misdemeanor. Finally, there was no proof of any great disparity of punishment in the various circuits.</SPAN></P>

The inmate was convicted in 1971 of concealing stolen property and sentenced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate alleged that he agreed to withdraw his motion for a new trial because his attorney told him that it would increase the chances that his motion for the sentence to run concurrently with other sentences would be granted. The motion was denied and the inmate alleged that the sentence imposed was interfering with his release from prison. The trial court dismissed the inmate's application for review because it was for review of his conviction by writ of error and applications for such relief must be addressed to the appellate courts. In his motion for rehearing, the inmate stated that his application should have been considered under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act; the motion was denied and the court affirmed. The court held that the time to appeal the inmate's conviction by an appeal in the nature of a writ of error had long passed. The court found that neither the inmate's claim that he was illegally arrested and searched, nor his averment that he was &quot;coerced&quot; into withdrawing his appeal and motion for a new trial stated any grounds for relief under the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence indicated that the deceased was defendant's former wife and lived in a trailer home at the residence of her parents. On the night in question, defendant, armed with a club and a pistol, went to the trailer home and forced his way into the home. Defendant thereafter shot the deceased and her mother and father. At trial, defendant admitted shooting the deceased and her parents, but denied shooting at anyone else and stated that he was drunk at the time of the shootings. On appeal, defendant urged that there was no valid first-degree murder statute at the time of the offenses, that the trial court erred in admitting over his objection the allegations of his ex-wife's divorce bill, and that his drunkenness precluded him from having the requisite intent for first-degree murder. The court affirmed, holding that the statutes relating to first-degree murder were in full force and effect at the time of the offenses. The court further concluded that the evidence did not support defendant's claim of such drunkenness, and that defendant opened the door to the evidence contained in his prior divorce bill by inquiring about sworn allegations as to his separation date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State's proof showed that defendant forced two women into his car and began having nonconsensual sex with the victim when the other woman hit him on the head with a rock. Defendant terminated the rape, attacked the other woman, drove to another location, and raped the victim again. Defendant was convicted for two separate rapes committed upon the same victim upon the same night. Defendant assigned error to the sufficiency of the evidence and the harshness of the sentence. The court determined that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that justifiable fear of force and violence was present, rendering the rapes &quot;forcible&quot;. The court ruled that each act of intercourse was a separate offense and was severally punishable. The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's imposition of consecutive sentences because defendant was totally unresponsive to the pleas of his one-time victim, and victimized her again. Affirming, the court held that the punishment fixed was not excessive because it was well within the limits prescribed by law.</SPAN></P>

Defendants left the State. Co-defendant turned himself in and told police he had committed the robbery with defendant and that defendant had shot a man in the store.

On appeal, the court held that the material evidence presented at trial showed that the jury's verdict of guilt as to both defendants was justified. Thus, the court determined, there was no merit to defendants' assertion that the evidence was insufficient to sustain their convictions. The court further ruled that the trial court properly instructed the jury to reconsider the sentence of 20 years which it had imposed for co-defendant because the sentence was less than the statutory minimum and, if allowed to stand, would have been void.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 39-1213. He appealed, claiming in part that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the conviction, that the language that he had used was not embraced in the statute's definition of conduct, and that if conduct included language, the statute was void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted under the second clause of &sect; 39-1213 for calling out &quot;sooey&quot; to a police officer. In reversing, the court ruled that the second clause of &sect; 39-1213 was not void for vagueness. Under that clause, a disturbance of the peace included conduct that was calculated to provoke violence or a violation of the law, which, the court ruled, was the only conduct punishable under the statute. Further, the court ruled that the meaning of conduct included language that consisted of fighting words, those words that by their very utterance inflicted injury or tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace. The test was what men of common intelligence understood were words that were likely to cause an average addressee to fight. Derisive and annoying words were within the statute's purview only when they plainly tended to excite an addressee to a breach of the peace. The court concluded that the word &quot;sooey&quot; was not a fighting word because there was no direct confrontation or exigent circumstances and that it would not have been expected to cause a breach of the peace when addressed to an officer trained to exercise a higher degree of restraint than average citizens.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erroneously overruled his challenges to the legality of four search warrants and erred in admitting in evidence the seized gambling devices and equipment and component parts. The court held that the search warrants were all proper. They sufficiently described the property and premises, a &quot;John Doe&quot; informant did not render the affidavit invalid, and a partitioned basement did not constitute multiple premises. None of the search warrants were incorrectly endorsed by the issuing officer. All the search warrants sufficiently showed probable cause and the fruits of the searches conducted thereunder were admissible. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict. The jury was justified in finding that defendant owned and operated a large number of slot machines and placed them in various clubs and organizations under arrangements by which he shared the proceeds of money risked and lost by persons playing those gambling devices, and that he was thus engaged in professional gambling on a grand scale. Gambling condemned by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2001 was not a lesser-included offense of professional gambling.</SPAN></P>

His was sentence to five to eight years. Defendant appealed. Defendant had been previously convicted on his pleas of guilty to three indictments of third degree burglary. A new trial was ordered on those counts based on a sentencing error and the conviction under attack resulted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was previously sentenced to consecutive sentences of 3 to 10 years. He contended that the increased sentence of not less than five years for the same activity formerly punished by a minimum sentence of not less than three years was impermissible. The basis for the greater minimum punishment resulted from the law that fixed different minimum sentences for the offenses defendant pleaded guilty to in the prior proceeding, three years for burglary in the third degree, and the offense specified in the indictment for which the jury found guilt, five years for burglary in the first degree. Based on the criterion of punishment, the offense of first-degree burglary was a greater offense than third-degree burglary. However, the court held that conviction in the first case of third-degree burglary worked as an acquittal of the first-degree burglary. Therefore, defendant should not have been tried for burglary in the first degree. His prosecution should have been limited to the less serious crime for which he pleaded guilty and successfully invalidated on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">During the robbery defendant did not display his weapon but in attempting to escape, he used it to take an employee hostage before being captured in the store next door. On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for a directed verdict because of the unconstitutionality of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-901's provision for discretionary capital punishment, and that testimony regarding his purported theft of an automobile was erroneously admitted. Rejecting defendant's arguments, the court found the evidence was more than sufficient for conviction and that defendant failed to carry his burden of demonstrating that the evidence preponderated against the verdict. Further, he was not charged with a capital offense as 1973 Tenn. Acts ch. 192, &sect; 4 provided a penalty for armed robbery of 10 years to life imprisonment. The fact that the state supreme court later found ch. 192 unconstitutional and void was irrelevant as it was not imposed to defendant's prejudice.

Defendant and others commenced picketing in front of the store.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants burglarized a factory equipped with an alarm system. The officers who responded to the alarm found a window had been broken and defendants were inside the burglarized house. Defendants were found at or beside the coin operated food and drink vending machines with tools in their pockets and tools on the floor nearby. They were wearing socks on their hands, and the vending machines showed efforts had been made to break into them. An accomplice, a sister of one of the defendants, was found outside the factory sitting in a station wagon. She was jointly indicted but a severance was ordered in her case. Defendants challenged the legality, sufficiency, and preponderance of the evidence. The court affirmed the judgments of conviction because there was abundant evidence on which the jury was justified in finding that defendants broke and entered the factory with intent to commit larceny, and they were properly found guilty of burglary. The court upheld the sentences because defendants were complaining about something that the jury could have done, but had not done. The court held that the challenged statute, 1973 Tenn. Pub. Acts 163, did not violate Tenn. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's 13-year-old sister-in-law was brutally stabbed to death. When a witness placed defendant in his car near the murder scene, contrary to defendant's statements of his whereabouts, suspicion focused on defendant. After extensive questioning, defendant confessed. Defendant was indicted for first-degree murder. The confession was admitted into evidence at trial, and the trial court convicted defendant. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. Defendant's attack on the indictment was without merit. A motion to quash was inapplicable because the indictment used the common law form without any reference to any statute and was not subject to demurrer because it clearly stated the offense under the common law, under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2402, before the substitution of the new statute created by 1973 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 192, and under the new &sect; 39-2402. The judicial declaration that 1973 Tenn. Pub. Acts ch. 192 was invalid had not only invalidated the new &sect; 39-2402 but had also invalidated the repeal of the old &sect; 39-2402. But even if it had not, the common-law offense of first-degree murder was clearly set out in the indictment. The other assignment of error were without merit.</SPAN></P>

The sheriff arrested defendant and his codefendant and confiscated the half-full bottle, the needles, and the syringes. The bottle was labeled dolophine hydrochloride, which was methadone. A chemical analysis showed the substance to be methadone as alleged in the indictment. Neither the defendant nor his codefendant testified or offered any evidence. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the State was not required to prove a negative, that the defendant had no prescription nor received the substance from a practitioner. Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 52-1444(a) provided that the State was not required to negate this exemption or exception and the burden of proof on this was upon the person claiming it. The court found that the statute was unconstitutional as an illegal delegation of authority by the Legislature to the Commissioner of Mental Health concerning the addition or deletion or rescheduling of controlled substances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant filed a writ of error with the court contesting his conviction of a crime against nature for which he was convicted in a trial court (Tennessee) and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion to quash the indictment, that a mistrial should have been declared, and that the trial court's charges to the jury were insufficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim, a four-year-old little boy, was attacked and sodomized in an alley. Defendant was charged with the crime but denied it. He was convicted and appealed. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to quash the indictment, which challenged Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-707, a sodomy statute, as being void for vagueness. The court disagreed and held that no defect or invalidity appeared on the face of the indictment and that the statute was constitutional. The court stated that crimes against nature, proscribed by &sect; 39-707, included sodomy. Next, the court found no merit to defendant's claim that the trial court should have declared a mistrial when the victim was brought in front of the jury. There was no basis for his claim that he was prejudiced by the identification of the child victim. As to defendant's claim that the trial court erred when it failed to define sodomy in its charge to the jury, the court held that the trial court's explanation to the jury was sufficient and that all persons of ordinary intelligence knew what act defendant was charged with. Finally, the court ruled that the jury was not required to return a special verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's vehicle was stopped by police. Upon his exit from the vehicle, defendant called to the passengers to &quot;clean up,&quot; and the police observed a small green bag being thrown from a window. The police recovered the bag off the ground, which contained 88 capsules of heroin. Defendant consented to a search of his vehicle and more drugs and money were discovered. Upon his conviction, he argued that &sect; 52-1432(a)(2) was void because it was unconstitutionally vague and uncertain in that it did not state what quantity was sufficient to raise an inference of intent to sell and that there was no sufficient rational connection between the possession of a quantity of drugs and the inference that it was possessed for the purpose of resale. The court disagreed and held that the statute properly left the inferences to the jury upon consideration of the amount of controlled substance possessed and other facts and circumstances shown in the proof. As to the admission of the heroin capsules into evidence, the court held that no search was involved in the recovery of the capsules because they were simply picked up out of the mud.

The court found that there was no evidence that the doctor had any awareness of defendant's mental condition on the dates in question. Next, the court held that there was no error in permitting the prosecution to call a witness who was not listed on the presentment because the presence of the witness, the arresting officer, was not a surprise nor did defendant suffer any prejudice as a result. The court found no merit to defendant's claims that the grand jury was improperly composed, that improper evidence was admitted, or that he was deprived the right of preliminary hearing. Further, there was no error in the trial court's exclusion of testimony regarding defendant's state of mind at the time of the sales, as the trial court held a hearing on the issue and properly determined that the testimony was incompetent.

On appeal, the court concluded that defendant did not tender any special request for a jury charge regarding voluntary confessions or waiver of his right to remain silent or to have counsel present. Nor did he incorporate them in his new trial motion. Absent a special request, the trial court did not error for failure to charge the jury as to the weight to be given a confession. There was nothing in the record to indicate that defendant 1's confession was not voluntary. Consequently, his counsel's failure to object to the admission of his confession into evidence did not demonstrate incompetency amounting to ineffective assistance. Co-defendant's counsel on cross-examination brought out defendant's confession which implicated co-defendant. Thus, co-defendant could not complain about incompetent evidence he elicited by cross-examination. Because there was no special requested charge regarding the death penalty in co-defendant's bill of exceptions, the trial court's failure to charge such a request was not properly before the court on appeal and was not considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants challenged judgments from the Criminal Court of Shelby County (Tennessee), which convicted them on three separate indictments charging them with violations of the Drug Control Act of 1971 for the possession of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin with intent to sell. They also challenged their sentences, which were ordered to run consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were tried, convicted, and sentenced on three separate indictments for the sale of drugs. They appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, the failure to declare a mistrial because of an unresponsive witness, the failure to reveal the identity of an informant, and the sentences imposed. The court found defendants were found in possession of large quantities of the drugs involved when officers searched their home under a valid warrant, so the evidence supported the convictions. A mistrial was not proper where the trial judge sustained defendants' objection to the unresponsive testimony and promptly instructed the jury to disregard the answer. Next, because the informant was not material to the case, his identity could remain confidential. However, the court agreed that the consecutive sentencing was improper. The court found that the fact that three different drugs were found, all of which carried different punishments, did not alter the fact that only one illegal transaction occurred. A conviction on one precluded conviction on the others. The court found the judgment carrying the greatest penalty was the only one to survive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court voided the convictions for selling cocaine and for selling marijuana. The court affirmed the conviction for possession of heroin with the intent to sell. The court affirmed the sentence imposed on that conviction, which was 10 years.</SPAN></P>

On direct appeal his conviction was affirmed. The prisoner filed a petition for post conviction relief, contending that his habitual criminal sentence was improper because the convictions used were void due to the failure of the trial court and the prisoner's counsel to inform the prisoner that his pleas of guilty could be used to enhance future conviction to habitual criminal status. The trial court dismissed the petition without an evidentiary hearing. The prisoner sought relief. On appeal, the court held that: (1) failure by the trial court hearing the prisoner's pleas of guilty and the prisoner's attorney to inform the prisoner that his pleas could in the future be used for enhancement purposes did not amount to error or ineffective assistance of council because there was no duty to warn of all possible collateral consequences of a plea of guilty; (2) three pleas of guilty could be used as three convictions for the purpose of enhancement even if the sentences ran concurrently; (3) the Habitual Criminal Act constituted neither double jeopardy nor cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner inmate challenged a judgment from a trial court (Tennessee), which sustained a demurrer by the State to the inmate's petition seeking post-conviction relief after the inmate was convicted of first-degree murder, and which dismissed the inmate's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate argued that the trial court erred when it failed to void the inmate's conviction and sentence since the grand jury which returned his indictment systematically excluded members of his race and since there was no indication in the record of a valid waiver of the inmate's constitutional guarantee of equal protection. On appeal, however, the court upheld the trial court's judgment dismissing the inmate's petition seeking post-conviction relief. Specifically, the court first held that it would not consider the matter regarding the systematic exclusion of members of the inmate's race in the grand jury since the inmate and his trial counsel made an election to by-pass an objection to the composition of the grand jury prior to trial as a deliberate, strategic choice. Therefore, the inmate was precluded from launching a successful collateral attack of the issue in his post-conviction petition. Secondly, the court rejected the inmate's argument that if the indictment was returned by a racially exclusive grand jury in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment there was no jurisdiction to try the inmate. Instead, the court held that the contention had been refuted by prior case law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An undercover officer purchased marihuana from defendant. Defendant denied both possession and sale, challenging the sufficiency of the indictment on the ground that it failed to inform him whether he was charged with a felony or a misdemeanor. He contended that since the indictment did not state the amount of marihuana possessed for sale, it did not charge a felony. The court said that possession of marihuana for the purpose of sale was a felony, regardless of the amount, and that the indictment was not defective in failing to set out the amount of marijuana involved. Nor was the name of the buyer essential. Although, under &sect; 52-1432(a)(2), a jury charge on inferences regarding the amount of marihuana possessed was mandatory where the intent of the possession was before the jury, defendant denied both possession and sale. Since neither side postulated mere illegal possession and the State's evidence reflected a consummated sale, defendant's requested charge was not required to be given. The court held that the Drug Control Act of 1971, as it applied to proscription of possession of marihuana for purposes of sale, was in all respects constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was a 19 year-old boy who was wandering around the country on a motorbike. While passing through the county, he was arrested. He was put in a part of the jail containing 10 others. The cells contained numerous razor blades and defendant had one in his hand prior to the sexual attack. At the direction of other inmates, the boy was forced into several acts of sodomy committed upon him per os and per anus. The act committed by defendant was per anus. The acts occurred in the evening of the boy's first day in jail, and he did not report the matter until he was taken to court for his hearing a few days later. The court found that it was reasonable for the victim to assume that a complaint would have been ignored and his personal safety further jeopardized thereby. Under those circumstances, the court held that it was clear that the victim did not consent to the crime and was not an accomplice; no corroboration of his testimony was necessary. The court further held that because the crime against nature meant the common law offense of sodomy and the crime was well defined and described at common law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-707 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Approximately two years later, defendant entered an appearance bond. The case was later continued at the request of the State. In response to defendant's motion to dismiss, the trial court allowed the State until a certain date to produce evidence. Two days before such date, a grand jury handed down a second presentment against defendant for the same offense. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss and to quash the presentment, claiming that his constitutional speedy trial rights were violated. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant was convicted on the last presentment. In affirming, the court stated that defendant's speedy trial rights were not violated because during the greater part of the approximately two year delay, defendant was not readily available to the State.

On appeal, defendants contended that the trial court erred in dismissing their motions to quash the indictment. Defendants' motions to quash provided that the indictments should have been drawn under the provisions of the Tennessee Motor Vehicle Title and Registration Law, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-101 et seq. The State argued that the language in the indictment, as defined under the Uniform Commercial Code, had no bearing upon the substantive criminal charge and the indictment apprised defendants for the charge against them under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-1957. In other words, the State argued that the law did not require perfection of the security interest in order for it to be a violation of law. The court held that the failure to have the security interest and note agreement recorded under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 59-101 did not cripple the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate sought review of a judgment of the Criminal Court of Shelby County (Tennessee), which denied his petition for postconviction relief. The inmate was convicted of first degree murder, and his punishment was fixed at death by electrocution. The inmate's conviction was previously affirmed in a direct appeal. The issue was whether the jury that set the death penalty was unconstitutionally chosen.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The question that the prosecution was &quot;primarily concerned with&quot; during voir dire was the attitude of the prospective jurors toward capital punishment. Jurors were repeatedly excused for cause when they said that they did not believe in capital punishment or were opposed to it. Most jurors were summarily excused because they said that they could not return the death penalty. There was no one left on the jury that did not expressly agree that he could have invoked the death penalty upon a finding of guilt without mitigating circumstances. A sentence of death could not be carried out where the jury was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or religious scruples against its infliction. However, the conviction was not void. There was no showing that the jury was biased with respect to the inmate's guilt. The State was not foreclosed from again seeking the death penalty, and the inmate had a right under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 39-2405 to have his punishment set by a jury. Thus, the court remanded the case for a new trial for a determination of punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the validity of the first degree murder conviction and judgment of guilt. The court vacated the punishment set and remanded the case for a new trial by a new jury on the issue of punishment.</SPAN></P>

He was remanded to the criminal court. The jury found him guilty and fixed his punishment at 30 years in prison. The prisoner then unsuccessfully moved for a new trial. Two months later after pronouncement of judgment, the prisoner executed a written petition signed by him and his privately retained counsel for a waiver of trial by jury and a request for acceptance of his guilty plea to robbery with a deadly weapon. In that petition, the prisoner agreed to accept a 10-year sentence. Simultaneously with the petition, the prisoner withdrew his appeal of his conviction and sentence for first degree murder in the perpetration of a robbery. He then unsuccessfully petitioned for postconviction relief. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that after his conviction the prisoner decided it was in his best interest to negotiate with the State about the 30-year prison term and other pending indictments. The court also found that there was no credibility to the prisoner's contention that he was subjected to police brutality and abuse or was forced to sign a confession.</SPAN></P>

He filed a petition for postconviction relief on several grounds, one of which was ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court dismissed the petition. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the inmate's contention that the robberies were not committed by use of a deadly weapon was untenable because it was common knowledge that a flare gun fired at point blank range could cause death or grievous bodily harm. With respect to the inmate's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the court noted that he did not make any charge that his guilty pleas were induced by any fraud or misrepresentation by his retained counsel.

In order to determine exactly what questions were previously raised and litigated, in the sense of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 40-3811, 40-3812, the court studied the transcript which the supreme court had before it upon the first appeal.

The court determined that petitioner's insistent contention was untenable. It represented a misconception. The court held that it was first necessary that a jury determined guilt of present crime before determining guilt or innocence of the habitual criminal count which finding, if guilty, enhanced the punishment of the present crime. If the jury found not guilty of the present crime then the habitual criminal count was not at issue.

Without an evidentiary hearing, the petition was dismissed. The court held that the inmate's allegation that there was no evidence to support the jury's verdict and that the evidence preponderated against his guilt formed no basis for a right to an evidentiary hearing. The weight or sufficiency of the evidence was not a proper subject of inquiry in a post-conviction proceeding. As for the alleged systematic exclusion of women from the grand and petit juries to the inmate's alleged prejudice, there was serious doubt that he, not being a member of the allegedly excluded class, could have been heard to complain. Moreover, the court held that the inmate's right to raise the question was waived when it was not raised upon the trial by motion or plea in abatement. The inmate's contention that his conviction was invalid because African Americans were systematically excluded from the Legislature that enacted the pertinent statutes was no ground for post-conviction relief. The question of proper answer content was never reached because the petition was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

They were tried together and found guilty of first-degree murder. The trial court of Davidson County (Tennessee) set punishment set at 99 years in the penitentiary. Each defendant perfected his appeal in the nature of a writ of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">All defendants alleged error in the admission into evidence of a tape recording of the police radio transmissions relative to the occurrence. The court felt that the tape recording was admissible as part of the res gestae, that such evidence was one of the accepted exceptions to the right of confrontation, and its that its nature and content was not so inflammatory and prejudicial as to require its exclusion. Witnesses who had previously given information important to the State's case that varied materially from what they wanted to testify to were properly treated as hostile witnesses. All witnesses used by the State were subpoenaed and there was ample time for defendants to ascertain their identities and talk with them, and the District Attorney General was not limited to the use of those witnesses whose names were listed on the indictment. The totality of the evidence led inevitably to the conclusion that the evidence had not preponderated against the guilty verdicts, and the court required no more. The only irregularity in the verdict was the recommendation of leniency for one defendant, but that was more surplusage and had not rendered the verdict uncertain or invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Subsequently, he entered pleas of guilty to two additional counts of rape, and he was again sentenced to 99 years imprisonment on each additional count. In his habeas corpus petition, the inmate attacked all three convictions. The trial court dismissed the petition. Affirming, the court held that the inmate's uncorroborated testimony that he had court appointed counsel for all three cases and that said counsel was ineffective did not sustain his burden of proof. The court held that the inmate's charge that members of the African American race were systematically excluded from the juries in his cases lacked merit. The court further held that there was no state or federal holding that in addition to a voluntary, knowledgeable confession of guilt by a plea of guilty, there must also have been proof of the guilt introduced before the jury. Clearly, the inmate weighed the possibility of receiving a death sentence if he went to trial upon a plea of not guilty in the latter cases, and he knowingly and freely elected to avoid that risk by entering a plea of guilty in each of those cases.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners contended that they were coerced to plead guilty at their trial and that they were deprived of various rights, including the right to introduce evidence prior to sentencing in violation of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-2310. One petitioner contended that he was deprived of counsel in an appearance before a juvenile judge prior to being tried as an adult. The court found no basis for reversal. The record left no doubt that petitioners voluntarily entered guilty pleas. Thereby, petitioners waived all non-jurisdictional and procedural defects and constitutional infirmities, if any, in any prior stage of the proceeding. Petitioners' rights under &sect; 40-2310 were similarly waived. The record did not support the claim of inadequate representation. At the time of the younger petitioner's arrest, transfer of jurisdiction to adult court was mandatory for certain offenses, including armed robbery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to burglary and grand larceny under a plea agreement in which the State agreed to dismiss a charge of robbery. The plea agreement was reduced to writing by his attorney, signed by defendant, approved and signed by both his parents, and entered into the record. After his incarceration, defendant filed the habeas corpus petition. The petition was not served on the prison warden. Defendant argued that he was not advised of his rights prior to questioning, he was denied access to an attorney while in jail, and that he did not have a fair and impartial trial. He also argued that his sentence was unconstitutional and illegal. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in treating the petition as a motion for postconviction relief. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment because the petition for habeas corpus was properly treated as a motion for postconviction relief under Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-3805 where the relief and procedure authorized by the statute appeared adequate and appropriate.

To support a verdict finding defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, there should be an evidentiary basis for a conclusion that the killing was willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated. Defendant and the deceased had an argument in a bar, during which he threatened to kill the deceased. They shook hands and defendant left the deceased seated at a table with the friends of the deceased. After a few minutes, defendant returned to the deceased's table and shot him. The court held that the jury was warranted in concluding that the killing came from deliberation and premeditation.

Code Ann. &sect; 40-3801 to 40-3824. Respondent was the State. After his first indictment was quashed and after a second indictment was returned, the inmate was convicted of grand larceny and of being a habitual criminal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate's instant petition was twice amended after it was filed. No answer was filed on behalf of the State, notwithstanding the clear mandate of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-3814. The order of the trial court dismissing the petition contained no finding of facts, contrary to the mandatory provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-3818. Without a detailed and clear finding of fact by the trial court, the inmate and his counsel and the court were at a complete loss to know the basis of the trial court's decision and judgment. Such official shortcomings alone would require reversal of the trial court's judgment and remand for a new trial upon the petition. However, inasmuch as the inmate had raised only a question of law under his single assignment of error, the court was constrained to consider it. The issue raised was whether the inmate was unconstitutionally deprived of due process and equal protection of the law. The court held that when a convicted defendant sought and obtained reversal of his conviction and a new trial, he was required to take the burden with the benefit. Further, the inmate at no time insisted that his conviction in his second trial was not supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court agreed, enjoining defendant from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.

The court found that this argument overlooked the decisions recognizing that unincorporated associations may have standing to sue on behalf of their members.

On appeal, the court noted that no proof was put on by defendant county before defendant commission. The method of assessment used by the county assessor was unsupported by substantial and material evidence. Any recognized method supported by substantial and material evidence of the assessed property's immediate intrinsic value would have been sufficient. The court reversed the portion of the trial court's order requiring residual valuation to be used to determine the value of plaintiff's property subjected to assessment.

Appellant's recurrent drug problem and criminal activity were significant evidence to show that appellant had wanton disregard for the welfare of his children prior to his incarceration. Absent a finding that appellant's failure to provide support had some element of intent, the court could not affirm the termination of his parental rights on this ground.

The court held that although the report was attorney work product, defendants had waived the privilege. By making the report a focal point at two public meetings, the city had, in effect, waived its right to claim the work product privilege. Thus, the records were subject to the Public Records Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city entered into an agreement to purchase land located within plaintiff county, to develop an industrial park. Defendant annexed the subject properties into its boundaries. Plaintiff county objected, and filed a declaratory judgment action against defendant, in an attempt to enjoin defendant from purchasing real property in the county without first obtaining its consent. The court found that the trial court did not err in finding Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 9-21-107(1) (1992) inapplicable to the case, since defendant was financing the project by using funds not generated by general obligation bonds or revenue bonds. Neither did the court err in considering an attorney's expert testimony, since the practice of the legal profession in working under an ambiguous statute was relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the statutory language. Additionally, the court found that, although plaintiff did have standing to challenge the validity of defendant's annexations, its challenges were meritless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, owners of strip club, challenged an injunction enjoining them from permitting lap dancing as a form of prostitution and from allowing lewd and obscene exhibition of genitals. Appellants argued that sexual penetration, oral sex, or homosexual sex was a prerequisite to a finding of prostitution. The court found since Tenn. Code Ann. &sect;39-13-512 did not explicitly require penetration for prostitution, the court could not disturb the lower court's reasoning that customers' touching of dancers' breasts and buttocks and dancers' grinding of genitals in customers' groin area constituted prostitution. Appellants argued an injunction against lewd and obscene exhibition of the genitals was a prior restraint in violation of U. S. Const. amend I. The court found the injunction attempted to prohibit a future undescribed activity and there was no determination that any act sought to be enjoined was obscene, so the injunction was a constitutionally impermissible prior restraint on speech.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Judgement affirmed in part and reversed in part; the definition of prostitution did not include sexual penetration, thus injunction that prevented appellants from allowing lap dancing as a form of prostitution was permissible; prohibition against lewd and obscene exhibition of genitals was an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff was injured while riding an all-terrain vehicle. Plaintiff filed suit against defendants on grounds of strict liability and negligence. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that plaintiff failed to bring her action within the 10-year statute of repose set by the Tennessee Products Liability Act (TPLA), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 29-28-103. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging that she was disabled and of unsound mind for 20 days following the accident, and that such disability tolled the statute of repose. Plaintiff appealed the court's grant of summary judgment to defendants. On appeal, the court noted that disability was not included in the three exceptions to the TPLA. The court was persuaded that the legislature did not intend for the 10-year statute of repose to be tolled for disability or any other exception not found within the statute itself. The grant of summary judgment was affirmed, because the stated purpose of the TPLA was to give manufacturers a definitive period of time in which they could insure against product liability suits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff contractor filed an interlocutory appeal from an order of the Chancery Court of Shelby County at Memphis, Tennessee, requiring the parties to submit a construction dispute to arbitration, rather than allow plaintiff to seek its remedies in court. Plaintiff asserted that the trial court erred in ordering the parties to arbitration because Tenn.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant hired plaintiff contractor to build a movie theatre. The contract between the parties contained an arbitration clause. Defendant terminated plaintiff before construction was completed.

The trial court stayed the proceedings and ordered the parties to arbitration. Plaintiff filed an interlocutory appeal. The court reversed the decision of the trial court in favor of plaintiff, and remanded the case for further proceedings, because the remedy set forth in Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 66-11-144 was the exclusive remedy in construction cases falling within the provisions of the statute, and it mandated that a contractor seek any remedy in a court of proper jurisdiction. The court held that the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 66-11-144 could not be waived by a contractual arbitration provision between parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, mother and daughter, brought paternity action against respondent alleged father when petitioner daughter was twenty years old. Petitioners' action was dismissed as untimely under the statute of limitations set forth in Tenn. Code Ann, &sect; 36-2-103(b) (repealed 1997). Petitioners argued that under &sect; 36-2-103(b), in effect when petitioner daughter turned 19 years old, no statute of limitations applicable to petitioners' cause of action existed. Section 36-2-103(b)(1) set forth the statute of limitations in paternity actions, which was one year past the age of majority. Section 32-2-103(b)(2) provided that an action could be brought if it could have been brought under &sect; 36-2-103(b), or if it had been brought and dismissed due to an earlier, more restrictive, and unconstitutional statute of limitations. Section 36-2-(b)(2) was intended to clarify that paternity actions could be brought on behalf of all children until their 19th birthdays, even if their actions would have been barred by the unconstitutional statute previously in effect. Petitioners' interpretation impermissibly created two disparate classes. Petitioners' action was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed a motion for relief from judgment. The court granted plaintiff's motion because the complaint was not lacking in clarity or specificity and clearly described the use of excessive physical force when plaintiff did not pose a threat of imminent danger.

Even though plaintiff filed a claim with the claims commission, defendant failed to raise the issue in the trial court that plaintiff waived his 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff inmate appealed an order of the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee, at Nashville, that granted defendant's Tenn. R. 12.02(6) motion, which dismissed plaintiff's action for its failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff inmate was adjudicated a habitual criminal in 1983, and he was sentenced to life in prison. While imprisoned, plaintiff assaulted two corrections officers on two different occasions. For the first, plaintiff's parole release eligibility date was extended from 2010 to 2040. For the second, his eligibility date was extended from 2040 to 2070. Both dates were extended in accord with Tenn. Dept. of Corrections Policy (Policy) 502.02, enacted in 1989. Plaintiff filed a declaratory action against defendant individual, asking the court to declare Policy 502.02 unconstitutional. Defendant filed a Tenn. R. 12 motion to dismiss. The trial court granted the motion, holding that the extension of the release date did not exceed the life sentence originally imposed and the extension was pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-[5]01(h), which was in effect on the date of plaintiff's crime and conviction. Plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed, as plaintiff failed to state a claim based on a lack of due process, and plaintiff failed to prove that the Policy inflicted a greater punishment upon him than was permissible at the time of his crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the order granting defendant's motion because plaintiff failed to show that the disciplinary policy inflicted a greater punishment on him than was permissible at the time of his offense. In addition, plaintiff inmate failed to present facts constituting a claim for a due process violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant had brought suit against appellee, claiming that the law under which appellee operated was unconstitutional. Specifically, appellant contended that the law violated the U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV and the Tenn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 and art.

On appeal, the court held that appellant failed to establish that it had standing to challenge the law. Since the allegations set forth in appellant's complaint failed to establish the interest harmed by the classification in the statute, there was no allegation that appellant's right to due process or equal protection were violated. The court went on to find that there was a rational basis for the statute and that it was not discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 48-103-101 et seq., by mounting an illegal takeover, but reversed that part of the judgment holding invalid defendant corporation's stock inscription limiting each stockholder to one vote regardless of the extent of stock ownership. Stockholder argued that TIPA was not applicable because he did not acquire plaintiffs' stock in defendant corporation pursuant to a &quot;tender offer or request or invitation for tenders&quot; within meaning of Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 48-103-102 (10)(A). The court disagreed, holding that the question of whether a solicitation constituted a tender offer turned on whether affected persons needed TIPA's protection. Thus, stockholder's solicitations constituted tender offers because there was no evidence that plaintiffs, the persons solicited by stockholder, were sophisticated, were insiders, or had access to reliable information concerning the financial condition of the company. Further, the equities resounded against allowing stockholder to disregard stock inscription regarding voting rights, which was honored for 50 years.</SPAN></P>

A decision that appellee met the notice requirement set for the amendment of an ordinance was affirmed. A decision that the buffer requirements established by the ordinance were constitutional were reversed and remanded. The court found no rational basis for the establishment of the buffers. No direct relationship existed between the goals of the ordinance and the sizable buffers mandated. The natural interpretation of &quot;expansion&quot; did not provide differentiation between expansion into formerly owned and newly ascertained property. Appellants' permit request was for the expansion of an existing landfill operation, thereby falling under the exception of the provision.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted appellee's injunction. The appellate court held that the circuit court's temporary injunction order violated the concurrent jurisdiction rule. The criminal court first acquired jurisdiction of the action to abate a public nuisance; therefore, the criminal court was the only trial court of this state with jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of the abatement proceedings against appellee.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff's daughter, without her mother's knowledge, requested and was referred to a public health clinic by school officials where she received medical treatment under Tenn.

Plaintiff brought an action against defendants, the involved public entities, contending violation of her federal and state constitutional rights to privacy as a parent to direct the education and upbringing of her daughter, her religious rights under the U.S. Const. amend. I free exercise and establishment clauses and the Tenn. Const., and federal and state due process clauses. Plaintiff sought money damages, and declaratory and injunctive relief. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted by the trial court. Plaintiff appealed. The court, finding no infringement on plaintiff's state and federal constitutional rights, affirmed the dismissal because she failed to rebut the presumption, under Tennessee common law, that her daughter, a 14-year old minor, had the capacity to consent to the medical treatment administered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A child's biological mother contracted with plaintiff adoption agency to surrender her parental rights to the child and to have child placed for adoption. Plaintiff sued defendant putative father, alleging abandonment, seeking termination of defendant's parental rights, and seeking custody for adoptive placement. The trial court terminated defendant's rights, concluding that defendant had abandoned his child as the result of (1) failing to visit and make payments to the mother prior to birth; (2) failure to pay a reasonable share of prenatal, natal, and postnatal expenses; (3) failing to pay child support; (4) failing to seek visitation with the child; (5) failing to show a willingness to assume legal and physical custody of the child; and (6) failing to file a petition to establish paternity within 30 days after notice of alleged paternity by the child's mother. Defendant appealed, and court affirmed, explaining that defendant's willful failure to visit or to make reasonable payments toward the support of the child's mother for four months immediately preceding birth constituted abandonment under Tenn.

Code Ann. &sect; 29-20-201. Plaintiff alleged that defendant sheriff violated his civil rights by delaying medical aid while he was a prisoner in jail. Plaintiff appealed the trial court's grant of summary judgment for defendants. Plaintiff suffered a compound fracture to his leg while attempting to escape from jail. Plaintiff alleged that medical personnel were present shortly after the fall but were not allowed to attend to his injuries as a result of defendant sheriff's direct orders. On appeal, the court noted that deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of prisoners constituted unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain, as proscribed by U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The trial court's grant of summary judgment on plaintiff's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim was reversed, because a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether defendant sheriff was deliberately indifferent to plaintiff's medical needs by delaying medical care to punish him for his escape attempt.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner appealed the dismissal of his petition. The appeals court affirmed the denial of declaratory relief because the facts did not support petitioner's contention that the department of correction acted unconstitutionally or illegally, or that it failed to substantially follow its own procedures. The court noted that it was not permitted to review the department's application of disciplinary policies to petitioner under the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, Tenn.

The court held that appellant county hospital had exceeded its authority by entering into unconstitutional business dealings with private entities, and issued an injunction permanently restraining appellant county hospital from engaging in such ventures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee private health care providers sought a declaratory judgment that appellants, a county-owned hospital and its business partners, had entered into business ventures that were ultra vires and in violation of the state constitution. The trial court held that appellant county hospital had exceeded its authority by entering into unconstitutional business dealings with private entities, and issued an injunction permanently restraining the hospital from such ventures. The reviewing court affirmed the judgment of the trial court as to the specific business ventures involving appellants, but modified the judgment by narrowing the permanent injunction. The court agreed with the trial court that appellant county hospital functioned as an agent and arm of the county. Applying the constitutional limitations set out in Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 29, the court found that the partnership ventures engaged in by appellant county hospital amounted to ultra vires acts under the Bradley County Private Acts and an unconstitutional application of the Private Act Hospital Act of 1996, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 7-57-601 et seq., under Tenn. Const. art. II, &sect; 29.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment that appellants had committed ultra vires, unconstitutional acts, was affirmed as modified. The terms of the permanent injunction were too broad and imprecise, therefore the court narrowed the injunction to provide that appellant county hospital was enjoined from entering into any business transactions with private businesses or individuals that obligated county funds unless authority was granted by vote of the county citizens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother of a 16-year-old boy challenged an order applying a downward deviation from child support guidelines. Appellee obligor, who was married and had three minor children born of the marriage, was the biological father of the 16-year-old boy. By a paternity order, the legal obligation of appellee to support the 16-year-old boy was recognized and his support obligation was set based on a net income. The trial court allowed a downward variation from the guidelines based on appellee's assertions that application of the child support guidelines would be inappropriate, considering the fact that one child of appellee's marriage was born before the paternity of the 16-year-old boy was established. Holding that the guidelines were a clear legislative mandate and that the courts had to follow them absent a legitimate basis for deviating therefrom, the appellate court reversed the judgment because, as required by Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 36-5-501(a)(1), child support was calculated by income assignment unless there was a specific finding that the child's interest would be best served by not having an income assignment or a written agreement approved by the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was reversed because state statutes provided for downward deviation of child support only in instances where the state had taken custody of the children pursuant to neglect, dependency, or abuse action, the children spent more visitation time with the obligor than was assumed by the guidelines, or where the obligor was subjected to an extreme economic hardship.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner pro se prisoner sought review of a decision from the Chancery Court of Davidson County at Nashville (Tennessee) dismissing his petition for writ of certiorari and for declaratory judgment, arguing that he was entitled to have his 75-year criminal sentence recalculated under the Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989, Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-101 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, a multiple felon incarcerated for a total of 75 years, challenged the trial court's dismissal of his petition for a writ of certiorari and for declaratory judgment. Petitioner argued that his sentences must be recalculated under the Criminal Sentencing Reform Act of 1989 (the Act), Tenn. Code Ann. &sect; 40-35-101 et seq., which would result in reduction of his imprisonment to only 25 years. On appeal, the court held that the Act was applicable only to active prosecutions and was not retroactive to sentences imposed before November 1, 1989, the effective date of the Act. To hold otherwise would be to open &quot;a pandora's box&quot; of old criminal cases and thwart the state's legitimate interest in preserving the finality of criminal litigation. Under either rational basis or strict scrutiny analysis, refusing to apply the Act retroactively did not violate petitioner's equal protection rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Tenn. Const. art. XI, &sect; 8. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision upholding petitioner's 75-year prison sentence because Tennessee's criminal sentencing reform act did not retroactively apply to sentences finalized before the effective date of the act and because equal protection principles did not require recalculation of petitioner's finalized sentence.</SPAN></P>
