</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer challenged defendant taxation director's assessment of a sales tax deficiency under the New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:32B-1 et seq., on sales of office furniture from its out-of-state headquarters to out-of-state dealers who sold and delivered the furniture from the taxpayer's in-state warehouses to in-state customers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Taxpayer, a Michigan corporation with warehouses in New Jersey, was assessed a sales tax deficiency under the New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:32B-1 et seq., on sales of office furniture purchased by out-of-state dealers who sold it to in-state customers. The court held that sales to dealers from taxpayer's New Jersey warehouse either for out-of-state or in-state delivery were not taxable if they were sales for resale and required director to consider proof of such. The court found that director's attempt to characterize the three-party &quot;dropshipment&quot; sale as a direct sale from taxpayer to New Jersey customers departed from the legislative intent to impose tax on the retail consumer at the point of final consumption and exposed the flow from manufacturer to market place to multiple taxation. Such a scheme was flawed because it was unclear whether tax would have been imposed on the wholesale price from taxpayer to its dealers or the retail sale from the dealers to their customers and because it violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3, where it imposed a greater burden on the taxpayer than on the manufacturers with no nexus with New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The challenge to the taxation director's assessment of a sales tax deficiency on the taxpayer's &quot;dropshipment&quot; sales of office furniture was upheld because the transactions were exempt sales for resale, and the attempt to characterize the three-party sale as a direct sale from taxpayer to New Jersey customers departed from the legislative intent to impose tax on the retail consumer at the point of final consumption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought a tax contest that challenged the tax director's assessment of a tax deficiency on its purchase and use of various secular books. The taxpayer contended that the sales and use tax could not be imposed on it during the period in which bibles were exempt from the sales and use tax where the exemption of bibles violated the first amendment. The tax director responded with a motion for summary judgment. The court held that even if the sales tax exemption for bibles violated the first amendment, the violation did not relieve the taxpayer of its duty to pay the sales tax on its secular books. Further, the court held that a first amendment violation did not give the taxpayer the right to retroactive relief for a tax refund where there was no economic disadvantage to be remedied. The court concluded that the taxpayer was not entitled to retroactive relief on the tax deficiency assessment. The court granted the tax director's motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant director of taxation made an assessment against plaintiff corporation for unpaid sales tax. The corporation filed a timely complaint, a settlement was reached, and the settlement was never entered. Subsequently, the director issued Certificates of Debt (COD) and the corporation sought review of a judgment from the Tax Court claiming the COD's gave them the right to have a redetermination of the debt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agreement, which reduced the assessment, was never filed and the COD's did not acknowledge the reduction. The corporation argued that the issuance of the COD's gave the court jurisdiction to reopen the prior default judgment against the corporation. The court held that the right to appeal a tax court decision had to be considered carefully as this was the only way to review of a decision of the tax court. The court held that the time limit for filing was 90 days and issuance of the COD's would not cut the time short, nor would it have extended the time to appeal. The court found that the corporation had failed to appeal the default judgment within 90 days and was, therefore, precluded from reopening that judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the corporation was a bona fide entity and that the corporation was the true purchaser of the yacht. Further, the court found that the individuals were officers of the corporation and did not individually purchase the yacht. In order for the corporation to claim the use tax exemption set forth in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:32B-11(2), the yacht had to have been used entirely in interstate commerce. The court held that the corporation was liable for the use tax because the yacht was used in New Jersey to entertain the individuals and their guests, the yacht was moored in New Jersey for part of the year, and the corporate address of the corporation was in New Jersey.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the use tax deficiency against the individuals, but the court sustained the director's assessment of the use tax against the corporation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This case involved the constitutional validity of the New Jersey boxing and wrestling media rights tax. Plaintiff contended that the tax as applied by defendants violated the First Amendment as well as the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The court concluded that the New Jersey media rights tax did not violate the First Amendment of the United States Constitution because the media rights tax was not a restriction on plaintiff's First Amendment rights and the imposition of the tax was no greater than essential to further New Jersey's substantial interest in regulating professional wrestling. The media rights tax did not violate the Commerce Clause because it was internally and externally consistent and therefore did not unconstitutionally burden interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, New Jersey Department of the Treasury, Division of Taxation, sought review of a judgment of the tax court (New Jersey), which determined that plaintiff taxpayer was entitled to a refund for property taxes paid by the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer initiated the action, seeking a refund of taxes erroneously paid on charges for installation of property, which were subsequently determined to be realty and not personalty. The tax court held that the taxpayer was entitled to an extension of time to file the refund claim under the Sales and Use Tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 54:32B-20(a), 27(b), and 27(c). The court found that the Division was not permitted to allow a refund of tax unless statutorily authorized to do so. Under the Act, a taxpayer was permitted to claim a refund within two years of the date of payment of the tax. Further, the court determined that a taxpayer was given additional time if it had consented in writing to the extension of the period for an assessment. The court held that, under the Act, the taxpayer was provided with an extended period of time within which to file a claim for refund that was equal to the period of the subject audit plus six months. Because the taxpayer signed a consent extension with the Division, the court held that it was entitled to additional time within which it was allowed to file the refund request. The court affirmed the judgment of the tax court.</SPAN></P>

The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The court granted the director's motion. The director did not exceed his authority by promulgating &sect;&sect; 7-8.5(b) and (c) because it was not inconsistent with N.J. Stat.

The court affirmed the tax deficiency assessment, holding that (1) even if the taxpayer was not paid by waste haulers, taxes were due on solid waste accepted by the taxpayer because &quot;accept&quot; did not mean when payment was collected, (2) that the statutory scheme under which the taxes were assessed did not violate equal protection or due process principles, (3) that the redirection orders and the joint order of the DEP and BPU could not have been attacked in the present proceeding, and (4) that all of the taxpayer's constitutional arguments were irrelevant to the director's assessment, but rather were aimed at the agency orders issued by DEP and BPU.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the tax did not violate equal protection. The classification of attorneys was rationally related to a legitimate government objective. The tax did not violate substantive due process. The class of attorneys recognized by the statute was reasonable and rationally related to the objective. The statute did not violate substantive due process rights because it was rationally related to the legislative object. The tax did not violate the separation of powers provision of N.J. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The promoter held sporting events in New Jersey and distributed the broadcasting throughout the world. The board imposed a media rights tax on those events, which the promoter reluctantly paid. The promoter argued that the media rights tax impinged on its First Amendment rights because the tax was content-based. The court denied both motions for summary judgment. The court found that the productions were a form of protected free speech, but they were symbolic speech or expressive conduct. The court also found that the statute at issue was a valid exercise of the state's police power and its interest in the safety of combative sports participants was a substantial one, which was completely unrelated to the suppression of free expression. The court determined that, as a narrowly-tailored license fee, the media rights tax would pass the test for constitutional validity, but there was not enough information to determine whether the statute was sufficiently narrowly tailored. The court also determined that there was an issue of fact as to whether the media rights tax was fairly apportioned. The court concluded, however, that the tax in issue did not violate the due process clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed an action against defendant New Jersey Department of the Treasury, Division of Taxation (division), to challenge a deficiency assessment of business personal property tax under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:11A-1 et seq., on property located at compressor stations and metering and regulating stations owned by the taxpayer, a gas transmission company.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer contested a deficiency assessment of business personal property taxes for property at various gas metering and regulating stations throughout the state. The property consisted of compressors, regulators, gauges, piping, tanks, and other items used for the purpose of compressing and moving gas through the taxpayer's gas pipeline. The division argued that these items were machinery, apparatus, and equipment not functionally essential to support the habitability of any structures, and thus, personal property. The court found that the division's definitions of habitability and structures, which made reference to human habitations, were appropriate for defining general purpose real property but too restrictive for special purpose real property like the pump stations at issue. Though the pipes, gauges, valves, and controls that were permanently affixed to the pipeline, which was real property, were not necessary for the habitability of the pipeline, they were functionally essential to the pipeline's operation and thus real property. The court ordered the parties to identify those items that were not affixed or ordinarily intended to be affixed to the gas pipeline.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled in favor of the taxpayer in its action against the division to contest a deficiency assessment of business personal property taxes and ordered the parties to identify all those pipes, gauges, valves, and other items classified by the division as personal property that were permanently attached to the taxpayer's pipeline and necessary for its operation for the preparation of a judgment consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff used large molds in connection with its operations, and these molds were periodically reconditioned by another company, then shipped to plaintiff's main offices for inspection, and once approved shipped on to plaintiff's various plants for use. The director assessed a use tax under the New Jersey Sales and Use tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:32B-1 et seq., against plaintiff for the labor charges associated with reconditioning its molds. Plaintiff appealed, asserting that the assessment was in violation of the commerce clause because the molds were in inter-state commerce and were not used within the forum state and therefore were not taxable. The court affirmed the director's assessment, holding that the molds were taxable because the interruption in their interstate journey gave rise to a taxable situs under N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club was involved in various charitable nonprofit activities and also leased out commercial office space in a building on the property in question. On appeal of the board's determination affirming the grant of the tax exemption, the court first determined that there was no question that the town could challenge the tax exemption and could argue that the subject property did not qualify for exemption under statutory and constitutional exemption requirements. Next, the court stated that when historic sites were used for commercial purposes, the fact that they were historic and were owned by nonprofit organizations was not sufficient to entitle them to exemption. Instead, the court held that the exemption was available when the use of the property was in furtherance of the preservation of the historic site by making the site available for public purposes, not for commercial purposes. Accordingly, the court held that because the use of the club's property was for commercial purposes, the property did not qualify for the exemption, pursuant to &sect; 54:4-3.52.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was in the business of acquiring, owning, and leasing gas stations to it parent company. One of the stations was in New Jersey and 13 were in other states. The taxpayer's corporate headquarters was in New York City. These premises were leased by the taxpayer's parent company. For the years in question, the taxpayer calculated its franchise taxes by using the three-factor apportionment formula set forth in N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 54:10A-6. The director rejected the taxpayer's claim that it was entitled to apportion its net income and net worth under the three-factor formula. The taxpayer sought review, and both parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The court granted the taxpayer's motion and denied the director's motion. The court held that, absent some evidence that the three-factor business allocation formula was deficient or did not do justice to the State, the formula should be used as a benchmark against which to judge the fairness of the director's &sect; 54:10A-8 adjustment. There was nothing in the language of &sect; 54:10A-8 that precluded use of the three-factor formula. The appropriate business allocation factor is the &sect; 54:10A-6 three-factor formula.</SPAN></P>

The municipality filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the taxpayers' action was time-barred, or if not, they had no legal right to recover the garbage taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1977, the municipality adopted an ordinance that created a garbage collection district. The taxpayers owned apartment properties. They had the apartment garbage collected by private companies, alleging that they were unaware of the ordinance and that their garbage would have been picked up if placed at the curb. They claimed that they first learned of the ordinance in 1986. The taxpayers sought to recover the garbage taxes that they paid. The court held that they had no right to a tax refund. The taxpayers had to pay the tax regardless of whether they received a specific governmental service, and no refund was authorized by statute. If the taxpayers did not avail themselves of the garbage service or if garbage service was denied to them, they were not entitled to a refund of that portion of the tax. The taxpayers also had no right to monetary relief for lack of garbage collection service for the period 1978 through 1986 because they did not request service for that period. The taxpayers were on notice that their property was in a garbage collection district. They could have an action for damages for the municipality's refusal to collect their garbage from 1986 through 1987.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the motion to allow further proceedings that would determine whether the taxpayers were entitled to other relief for the period August 1, 1986 through September 30, 1987.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Transfer Inheritance Tax Bureau of the Division of Taxation valued decedent wife's life estate in a marital trust using a mortality table for females. The value of the life estate and the resulting tax were significantly higher using the female mortality table than would have resulted from the use of a male table or a gender-neutral table. The taxpayer alleged that the gender-based mortality table resulted in invidious and invalid discrimination against women in violation of the United States Constitution and the New Jersey Constitution. The Director alleged that the gender-based tables were more accurate in valuing the right to receive income for life, but an actuary testified that only 19.4 percent of females live longer than males. The court concluded that the use of gender-based mortality tables was not substantially related to the achievement of governmental objectives. The Director failed to prove that the gender-based tables were more accurate. The court held that the Director appropriately used date-of-death tax rates to calculate the compromise tax on the contingent remainder interests. The state's right to an inheritance tax vested as of the date of death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three years after the taxpayer purchased a car it was impounded by the police as a stolen car. The taxpayer applied to the state for a refund of the sales tax paid on the car, and the application was denied on the ground that it was not filed within the two-year period of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:32B-20(a). The taxpayer then filed an action to recover the refund. The court dismissed the complaint, holding that because no refund was sought within the two-year period, no refund could be obtained. The court found that given the control of the legislative branch over taxation, judicial engrafting of a discovery rule on refund statutes of limitations was not proper because enforcing the collection of municipal taxes involved an area of special legislative concern and required judicial deference to the legislature's expression of public policy in the area. The court also found that in the absence of statutory authority, taxes voluntarily, although erroneously, paid could not be refunded. The court concluded that even if a timely application had been filed, the taxpayer would not be entitled to a refund because she obtained rights in the stolen vehicle that were tantamount to good title.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The director imposed a tax assessment on the taxpayer's purchase of an airplane. The taxpayer contended that the purchase and use of the aircraft were exempt under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:32B-835, and if not exempt under that statute, then the imposition of the use tax was violative of the Commerce Clause. The court affirmed the director's use tax assessment, holding that the predominant use was for private, not common, carriage. Therefore, the aircraft was not being utilized within the reasonable intention of the legislature. The court was satisfied that a predominant use test was a reasonable interpretation of &sect; 54:32B-835. Further, the court stated that there was no evidence that the aircraft, although based in New Jersey, was ever removed from the stream of interstate commerce. There was a sufficient nexus that existed to justify taxation by New Jersey, and the tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce because it was imposed uniformly on residents and nonresident, and on intrastate and interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The oil refining company claimed that 1986 N.J.

Const. art. 8, &sect; I, para. 1(a), and the improvements in the refinery were personal property and not real property for tax purposes. The city claimed the improvements were attached to the real property and taxable as real property. The court affirmed the determination by the city that the improvements were taxable as real property and held that, although the evidence showed that the improvements could be dismantled and moved, the intent of the oil refinery improvement construction showed that they were attached to the real property and it was not anticipated that they would be moved. The court further held that the state had the right to classify certain property as real property and the definition of the improvements as being part of the real property was not a denial of equal protection, a special law, or lacking in uniformity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a foreign corporation that made equipment and invested in real estate and securities.

The taxpayer reported as income the net losses from the sale of real property and excluded income from manufacturing and sales. It computed the allocation factor under N.J. Stat.

The taxpayer challenged the assessments on the basis that its business was non-unitary. The tax court and appellate court held that the business was not unitary, but the supreme court reversed and remanded.

The directories contained advertisements, for which the taxpayer received advertising fees. It was undisputed that other than those advertising fees, the taxpayer received virtually no income from the directories. The director assessed a sales tax against the taxpayer in connection with the taxpayer's purchases of printing materials and services. The taxpayer filed a complaint challenging the assessment. Thereafter, the director changed the theory to support his assessment, seeking to tax the transactions between the taxpayer and its advertisers. The court ruled in favor of the director, finding that the director could assert an alternative theory to support his assessment and while the transactions between the taxpayer and its printer constituted exempt sales for resale, the taxpayer's subsequent resales to the consuming public were taxable events. Because the resales occurred in the state, the assessment was within the state's taxing power.

The taxpayer began initiating a plan for forest management in 1981 but did not have a contract to sell wood products until April 1982.

The court found in favor of the taxpayer, holding that even though the property was used for nonagricultural purposes, those purposes were incidental, and the &quot;dominant&quot; use was for agricultural purposes within the meaning of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-23.2. Further, the taxpayer did not have to have been under contract to sell agricultural products before his land could have been deemed devoted to agricultural purposes.

The Board granted the farmland roll-back assessment. The court held that the taxpayer's special statutory tax treatment granted pursuant to the HMFA Law did not exempt it from the roll-back provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-23.8. In promulgating the HMFA Law, the legislature did not exempt from roll-back taxes previously qualified farmland that, pursuant to HMFA Law, was eventually granted tax abatement. When the resolution and abatement agreement were adopted &sect; 54:4-23.8 had been in effect for approximately 18 years, and the taxpayer was chargeable with its provisions.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff brought a claim for a tax refund, contending that the taxes were erroneously imposed because &sect; 40:55D-59 had been declared unconstitutional. The court denied plaintiff's request for a refund because plaintiff did not file a timely appeal as required by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:51A-9. The court held that plaintiff could not justify its failure to bring a timely appeal by asserting an estoppel claim based on plaintiff's misplaced reliance on the assessor's unauthorized statements. The court ruled that &sect; 40:55D-59 was presumptively valid at the time the county board made its decision and that the public policy requiring the expeditious pursuit of legal remedies militated against disregarding the county board's decision. The court held that any judgmental errors that were made by the county board were not reversible under the correction of errors statute.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer was a nonprofit corporation, under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1-1 et seq., and a dental service corporation, under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:48C-1 et seq.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer contended that it was entitled to a sales tax exemption because N.J. Stat.

The Director countered that the taxpayer was only entitled to a sales tax exemption after it applied for and satisfied the Director that it was qualified for an exemption, under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:32B-9(d). Under N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, &sect; 24-2.14(c), the exemption was effective as of the application date. The taxpayer was not exempt for sales tax on January 28, 1981. The statutes created categories for potentially tax-exempt organizations. Tax exemption under the New Jersey Sales and Use Tax Act was not automatic. Exemption for the Act was subject to application, verification, and certification. The taxpayer was not exempt from sales date prior to its date of application, even though it was a charitable organization under the Dental Service Corporation Act. It was not entitled to a refund.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the township's motion, finding that the language in &sect; 54:2-39 was clear and unambiguous. The court determined that &sect; 54:2-39 was constitutional. The court found that the principle was that taxes had to be paid as a condition to litigating liability was firmly embedded in New Jersey law, and cases that have considered the issue uniformly reject due process and equal protection challenges to the requirement of prior payment. The court determined that the appeal was from a judgment of the county board and at the time the appeal was filed all the taxes for the year under review had not been paid. Full payment after filing the complaint did not cure the defect. The property owners did not show that the failure to pay was due to indigence.

The state held that this income must be taxed on a gross basis in determining the taxpayer's individual liability under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act (Act). The taxpayer argued that the state regulations based on that reasoning were contrary to the Act. On review the court agreed, holding that the state's determination predicated on the disallowance of deductions for business expenses to the extent allocable to tax-exempt income was irreconcilable with the statute and would be set aside. In addition, N.J. Admin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ETT was levied on New Jersey income earned by out-of-state residents. The New Jersey Supreme Court held that the ETT was unconstitutional. It granted prospective relief only. The taxpayers argued that they were directly harmed, unlike an earlier case, by the continued collection of the tax and that prospective relief should not apply. The Director contended that the court was free to fashion a reasonable remedy and that the earlier decision did not turn on the lack of harm. The court agreed and affirmed. The United States Supreme Court repeatedly rejected the argument that a court must grant retrospective relief for past constitutional violations, looking to the purpose to be served by the new rule, the extent of reliance on the old rule, and the effect on the administration of justice of requiring retroactive application of the new rule. New constitutional rules could only be prospective if retroactivity hurt important societal interests. Here, the harm to the taxpayers was not a controlling consideration. Further, since New Jersey did not tax the income from outside of New Jersey, it did not need to allow non-residents to deduct losses from non-New Jersey sources.</SPAN></P>

The bank computed its tax liability and included its holding of federal obligations in its net worth and its included income from the same securities in its net income tax base. The bank paid the tax and filed a refund claim contending that the Federal Public Debt Statute,&nbsp;31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 742, proscribed any state taxation of federal obligations and the state's taxation of the bank's federal holdings was barred by the supremacy clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, para. 2. The court affirmed the director's decision, finding that the denial of the refund claim was correct because the corporation business tax liability of commercial banks was to be calculated based on the bank's ownership of and income from obligations of the federal government.

The court first determined the true valuation of the property. The leasing company contended that the statutory formula employed in the computation of the Director of the Division of Taxation's ratio accorded undue weight to large sales, and that Chapter 123 was constitutionally inadequate. The court determined that the Chapter 123 ratio for the town in 1981 was 47 percent and the upper limit of the common level range set by the director was 55 percent. With the adjustment of one lot that was not appealed the true value was 53.27 percent and within the director's range.

The court noted that the use of the cost approach in valuing the cooperative was not useful here because both the taxpayer and the city improperly conducted it. Likewise because the income approach was utilized only as a check against the improperly conducted cost approach the court gave it no weight. The court also concluded that the gross sell-out price based on outside prices was not indicative of the price that would be paid for the property as a whole on the assessment date.

The taxpayers alleged that the income was net profit from the husband's business as an independent contractor, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54A:5-1(b), making them eligible to set off expenses. The court held that the taxpayer husband's income was derived from the operation of a franchise business and not from commissions based upon the language of the agreement and the totality of the circumstances. The agreement was invalid as an employment contract in that it permitted diversion of a portion of wages for lost inventory, which was prohibited under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:11-4.4. Additionally, a prospective employee would not have been expected to meet the financial prerequisites. Therefore, the taxpayers were entitled to a refund.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the carrier was entitled to a refund for taxes paid under &sect; 48:4-20 except on taxes paid on charter bus mileage traversed in New Jersey. The court concluded that the bus excise tax was void because it discriminated against, and fell with disproportionate economic weight on interstate commerce. Thus, it offended the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution because there was no complementary tax on intrastate commerce after the repeal of the gross receipts tax formerly imposed on intrastate carriers under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:4-14. The court also determined that the N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent bequeathed various assets to her stepgrandchildren. She also devised a life estate in her residence to a friend. However, the friend advised the executors that she would not accept the life estate. For inheritance tax purposes, the bureau treated the decedent's stepgrandchildren as Class D beneficiaries and assessed a tax on the transfers at the 15 percent rate set forth in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:34-2(d). In addition, the bureau refused to recognize the friend's renunciation and imposed a tax on the devise. The executors sought review of the bureau's decisions, claiming that under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:34-2.1, the preferential Class A rates were applicable to the bequests to the stepgrandchildren and that the friend's renunciation was valid. The court found that the bureau properly taxed the bequests to the stepgrandchildren because N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:34-2.1 excluded bequests to stepgrandchildren from Class A treatment and the classification did not violate the stepgrandchildren's equal protection rights. The court also held that the bureau erred in its treatment of the life estate because the friend's renunciation was unequivocal and was made within a reasonable time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporate taxpayer contested the assessment of New Jersey corporation business tax for the year 1980. The taxpayer, a Maryland corporation engaged in the manufacture of asphalt roofing products, maintained that its contacts with the State of New Jersey were insufficient to subject it to taxation under the New Jersey Corporation Business Tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Jersey Corporation Business Tax imposed a franchise or privilege tax on every foreign and domestic corporation for the privilege of having or exercising its corporate franchise in New Jersey, or for the privilege of doing business, employing or owning capital or property, or maintaining an office, in New Jersey. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-2. The court found that the tax was fair and constitutionally permissible and dismissed the taxpayer's complaint. First, there was a sufficient nexus with the taxing state to justify the tax because 25 percent of the taxpayer's sales force, one of which was a New Jersey resident, regularly and systematically solicited orders from New Jersey customers, promoted products, and investigated and reported customer complaints. Second, the tax was fairly related to benefits provided by New Jersey to the taxpayer. Third, the tax did not discriminate against interstate commerce. Finally, the court held that the allocation formula represented a fair apportionment of the taxpayer's net work based on its business activities in New Jersey.</SPAN></P>

Neither the trustee nor the beneficiaries lived in New Jersey, and none of the trust assets were located there. The court found that Due Process, U.S. Const. amend.

Upon consideration, the court affirmed the board's assessment, holding that: (1) the cost and acreage approaches used by the taxpayers' expert was rejected because they included use of the sale of the entire campground before development and because they used the pre-sale tax assessment of the property as a part of the calculation of value; (2) the market approach was the proper approach for the valuation of the subject campsites; (3) uniformity of assessment required the assessment of each campsite to be based on its market value as reflected by comparable sales, without discounting; and (4) the taxpayers' discrimination claim failed.</SPAN></P>

The Board granted the widower a 100 percent exemption from local real estate taxes on his property for the tax year 1981 pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-3.30.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The widower and his deceased wife were both veterans of the U.S. armed forces. Following their retirement, they married and settled in Wrightstown, New Jersey. The decedent subsequently had a radical mastectomy as a result of breast cancer. The decedent died in 1979; the Board disallowed the widower's claim for a tax exemption under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-3.30(b) on the ground that the statute applied only to widows and not widowers. However, the Board later posthumously granted the decedent a disabled veteran's exemption from property taxes under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-3.30 in 1981. The exemption was extended to the widower. The Borough appealed the decision. The Borough contended that the statute referred only to widows and therefore did not apply to the widower. The widower alleged that granting the exemption to widows only was an unconstitutional violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution. The court determined that &sect; 54:4-3.30(b) could not be extended to encompass widowers as well as widows but that the statute as written did not violate the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The court lacked jurisdiction. The company had to exhaust its administrative remedies.

Although the corporation accepted payments at the New Jersey offices of its parent corporation, all of its own places of business were located in Pennsylvania. It had no New Jersey offices, employees, bank accounts, records, or billboards. In the corporation's challenge to the director's New Jersey income tax assessment against it, the court entered judgment granting the corporation's claims for refund. The director failed to make the required showing of a substantial nexus with New Jersey and a fair relationship to the services provided by the state. The presence of a parent corporation in the state did not provide a sufficient nexus for taxation. The facts did not warrant an inference of substantial, regular use of either New Jersey's courts or its recording offices, and the corporation's radio advertising did not constitute a nexus for tax purposes. The corporation's receipt in Pennsylvania of loan payments made by persons residing in New Jersey did not render the income taxable because the loans and the interest income they generated did not have an independent situs in New Jersey.</SPAN></P>

The Act imposed a franchise or privilege tax upon every domestic and foreign corporation with certain activities within the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was a foreign corporation engaged in a coal brokerage business in other states. Its offices were located in another state. In 1962, the corporation's senior vice-president moved to a home in New Jersey. The corporation did not require him to move there, but provided him with a home office. On review, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part the director's determination, granted the corporation's application for a refund of taxes for 1961, but denied the corporation's application for a refund for the tax years 1962 through 1976. The court concluded that the corporation was subject to taxation in New Jersey under the Act for the period 1962 to 1976, because its intrastate activities exceeded the mere solicitation of orders under 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 381 (1970) where (1) the vice-president encouraged customers to pay delinquent bills, handled customer complaints and adjustments, and supervised other corporate personnel from his home office; and (2) the corporation's business property was located in the home office.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers, corporations whose operations involved the use of hazardous substances, sued the state, alleging that the New Jersey Act establishing a fund to be used to clean up hazardous substance spills was preempted by CERCLA, a federal act establishing a similar fund, and sought to recover the money they had paid to the state fund. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The court denied the taxpayers' motion and granted the state's motion. The court determined that CERCLA did not preempt the New Jersey Act. Section 114(c) of CERCLA did not preempt the state from collecting a tax to be used pay hazardous waste cleanup costs that were not covered or actually compensated under CERCLA, therefore a taxpayer would not be taxed twice for the same activity. In enacting CERCLA, Congress acknowledged that direct state action was necessary to assure adequate response to hazardous spills and that its fund was insufficient to pay for all of the cleanup costs; to hold that CERCLA preempted the New Jersey Act would therefore go against legislative intent.

The lots were used for camping and recreational purposes, and were available only to residents of the owning township and their guests. The property was operated at a loss and was subsidized by the taxpayers of the owning township. Prior to 1978, the property was exempt from taxation. To support its decision to tax the property, the taxing township argued that the limitation on the use of the property to residents of the owning township removed the property from public purpose use, thus preventing exemption from taxation. The court held that property owned by a taxing district and used for public purposes was exempt from local property taxation under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:4-3.3. Campground facilities furnished by a governmental entity for recreational use were a well recognized public purpose. Moreover, the limitation on use to residents of the owning township did not affect the right to exemption. Thus, the subject property was exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue before the court was the taxability of a deferred compensation installment agreement received after the effective date of the Act, by the taxpayer husband who had retired prior to the effective date of the Act. The taxpayer filed a gross income tax return but did not include in that return the installment payment of deferred compensation. However, this amount was included in the taxpayer's federal income tax return. The director, following an audit, imposed a deficiency. The court denied the taxpayer's motion and granted the director's motion for summary judgment. The requirement that federal accounting methods be used for New Jersey gross income tax purposes leads to the conclusion, in the case of a cash basis taxpayer, that the word &quot;earned&quot; as used in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54A:9-27(a) meant &quot;received&quot; or &quot;constructively received.&quot; Deferred compensation payments, which are not assignable, discountable, or marketable prior to receipt, were subject to New Jersey gross income tax upon actual receipt after the effective date of the Act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers alleged that under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-27(a), only income earned on or after July 1, 1976 was taxable. The court determined that the taxpayers sold their property in 1973, at which time they received a note for the balance of their payment. Because the taxpayers were operating on a cash basis, ordinarily their income would have been recognized when it was received. In this instance, the gain was realized when the taxpayers received cash and a note for the balance due. However, in 1973 the taxpayers elected for federal income tax purposes to treat their income from the sale under the installment method, thereby requiring them to return as income in any taxable year that proportion of the installment payments actually received in that year, in accordance with the provisions of I.R.C. &sect; 453A. Having so elected, then by reason of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 54A:5-1(c), :8-3(c), any portion of the gain received by them during the tax year 1977 constituted gross income as determined in accordance with the method of accounting allowed for federal income tax purposes.

The court concluded that the supplemental provision of the rebate statute was unconstitutional special legislation because there was no conceivable rationale as to the classification inherent in the provision other than a capricious retroactive deprivation of the benefit of a rebate. Further, the court held that the rebate statute was special legislation and thus violative of the constitutional command found in N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, para. 9.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:32C-1 et. seq., and the Atlantic City luxury tax were unconstitutional. The association and seller filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act taxed alcohol wholesalers at a rate of 6.5 percent. Retailers in the City had to pay this tax plus an additional four percent luxury tax levied by the City. This resulted in a total tax of 10.5 percent, which was greater than the 6.5 percent tax paid by other retailers. The association and the seller proceeded by an order to show cause to restrain the collection of the taxes. The relief was denied and the association and the seller then brought an action against the State and the City claiming that the statutes were unconstitutional. Due to the unique nature of the alcoholic beverage industry and the broad power of the legislature to control the industry, the constitutional challenge failed. The court reasoned that if the Twenty First Amendment could terminate alcohol sales, the State had a broad power to tax for revenue. As to the improper classification of the taxes as applied, the court found that the classifications were valid because they were justified on a reasonable theory. Also, this was not a case of an invalid double taxation because the same type of taxes were not being levied by the same governmental body.</SPAN></P>

The survivor benefit was a funded, contingent annuity that was payable commencing upon the death of the covered employee. The court held that the New Jersey Transfer Inheritance Tax was a privilege levy on the right to succession to property transferred by a decedent, levied on the transferee in specified cases. N.J. Admin. Code &sect; 18:26-5.19 zeroed in on annuities purchased by or vested in a decedent and made payable by him or to another at or after his death. Such annuities were expressly made subject to the inheritance tax by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:26-5.19(a). The characterization of a benefit as an &quot;annuity&quot; did not depend upon its purchaser. Taxation of the same property in different forms, by means of taxes of differing character, was not impermissible.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Jersey Corporation Business Tax Act imposed a franchise tax on all nonexempt foreign and domestic corporations for the privilege of having or exercising its corporate franchise in the State of New Jersey, or for the privilege of doing business, employing or owning capital or property, or maintaining an office, in the State of New Jersey. The director used a New Jersey audience factor to determine the amount of broadcasting receipts that were reflected in the numerator of the receipts fraction of the three-factor allocation formula under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-6, for the purposes of apportioning the taxpayer's net worth and net income tax base under the Act. The taxpayer appealed the director's use of the audience factor. On review, the court set aside the director's action and vacated the assessment. The court held that the use of the audience factor was improper in the course of the director's adjudication of the taxpayer's liability because that constituted an administrative rule, which was invalid for the failure of the director to comply with the rule-making requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, N.J.

The parent company managed the offices and paid the salesmen and other employees. The parent company funded the offices by charging its subsidiaries commissions. The corporation provided some training for the salesmen to make them familiar with the corporation's products and had some input in hiring, firing and performance review of salesmen. The director denied the corporation the right to apportion a part of its income to the sales offices for the purposes of franchise taxes. The court affirmed the director's decision and found that the sales offices were not regularly maintained places of business of the corporation as defined in N.J. Admin. Code tit. 18, &sect; 7-7.2(a) because the corporation's involvement in the sales offices was indirect. The court also found that the corporation failed to present sufficient evidence that it was potentially liability for franchise taxes in California and Massachusetts such that the denial of the right to apportion in New Jersey constituted double taxation and a violation of the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were public utilities licensed by the State of New Jersey to collect and dispose of solid waste. The court held that it was clearly demonstrated at trial that the subject property, the taxpayers' waste containers that were attachable to the taxpayer's dumpster vehicles, were not registered under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39 and were merely used for determining the vehicle load. Thus the taxpayers invoked the administrative regulation, N.J. Admin. Code &sect; 18:9-3.8, as authority for the exemption. The regulation at least appeared to broaden the exemption accorded to Title 39 vehicles in the Act. However, the property was in fact designed to be easily severable and was not registered under Title 39. The taxpayers simply were unable to avoid the brute fact that the subject property was unequivocally designed to be a completely independent and totally unintegrated piece of equipment. The primary use of the property was as a trash receptacle that spent the majority of its useful life on customers' property and not attached to a Title 39 vehicle. The taxpayers thus failed to prove that the containers were integrated equipment under the Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:11A-2(b)(3).</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer sought to freeze the court's prior judgment, and the town contended that the exception to the operation of the freeze statute allowing changes in the assessment based on changes in the value of the property occurring after the assessment date was meant to refer to both changes in true value and changes in the assessment based on changes in the average ratio. The court granted the taxpayer's motion and held that the town's interpretation would have given the statute an unnecessarily narrow effect that could have resulted in yearly changes not related to changes in the market value.

In order to recoup those purported sales tax overpayments, the taxpayer took deductions from quarterly sales tax returns for ongoing sales. The Director filed the deficiency assessment to recover the deductions. The court held that any claim that the taxpayer might have had to recover his alleged overpayments was barred by the failure to utilize the provision for the overpayment of sales tax in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:32B-20(a). Thus the court granted the Director's dispositive motion for summary judgment. The court decided that even if the taxpayer's legal theories had merit, it only could prevail by establishing them as part of a refund application, which it did not do. The court found that the Director expressly prohibited the taxpayer's set-off practice in a regulation, N.J. Admin.

Five years later, the director announced that no such exemption existed. When a sales tax on such repair charges was imposed against the taxpayer, it filed an action challenging the assessment. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The court denied the director's motion as to the taxpayer's Commerce Clause argument because the Act might be found to violate the Commerce Clause if the taxpayer could show actual duplicative taxation. The director's motion was otherwise granted, and the taxpayer's motion was denied, because the director's power to make assessments did not depend upon prior adoption of a rule attended by notice and a public hearing. The director's failure to provide notice and a public hearing did not deprive the taxpayer of due process, nor did the taxpayer's detrimental reliance upon the prior exemption estop the director from assessing the tax.</SPAN></P>

Defendants contended that there was an absence of a genuine issue of any material fact and moved for summary judgment pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 4:46-2. Specifically, defendants contended that 1980 N.J.

The court agreed with plaintiff borough's argument that 1980 N.J.

The court held that while powers or jurisdiction could not be simply implied on behalf of an administrative official, the grant of an express power was always attended by the incidental authority fairly and reasonably necessary or appropriate to make it effective. The legislature intended that the director determine, in the context of the unearned income tax, what a net gain would actually be. A quasi-legislative regulation was presumptively valid, and the party attacking the regulation had the burden to demonstrate that it was arbitrary, capricious, unduly onerous, or otherwise unreasonable. Another basic tenet of judicial review was that a court could not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the wisdom of a particular quasi-legislative administrative action as long as the action was statutorily authorized and was not patently arbitrary or illegal. The retroactive effect of the tax upon the taxpayers was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant New Jersey Director of the Division of Taxation filed a motion to dismiss the complaint of plaintiff taxpayer. The court converted the motion to one for summary judgment. The taxpayer had sought a refund of an overpayment assessed for the year 1975 under the Capital Gains and Other Unearned Income Tax Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:8B-1 et seq. (repealed by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54A:9-24 effective July 8, 1976).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On October 8, 1974, the taxpayer and others entered into an agreement with a third party, granting the third party an option to purchase stock in a corporation that was jointly owned by the taxpayer and others. A modification of the option agreement extended the time to exercise the option until January 17, 1975. When the option was finally exercised, February 5, 1975 was fixed as the closing date and the closing took place on that date. The taxpayer's share of the purchase price was $ 2,146,667, resulting in a capital gain of $ 2,073,074 upon which the taxpayer paid a tax of $ 163,307. The taxpayer's request for a refund was denied by the Division. The taxpayer contended that the retroactive application of the tax under the Act to his stick sale transaction violated constitutional due process and equal protection. Granting the motion, the court held that when the taxpayer extended the option, he was not allowed to safely assume that the New Jersey legislature would not impose a capital gains tax retroactively. The court also ruled that the taxpayer failed to set forth facts establishing that the taxable event occurred before the Act's effective date.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer contended that, if it could prove that it was the only scheduled airline taxed on the sale or use of its aircraft, aircraft parts and equipment, such selective enforcement of the sales and use tax would be an unconstitutional denial of equal protection. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that selective enforcement was not by itself a constitutional violation of equal protection. It had to be shown that the selection was based upon an arbitrary classification and the taxpayer failed to meet this burden of proof. The court found that the transaction did not have the formalism usually associated with arms-length financing transactions and ultimately its terms were disregarded by the parties. Taxpayer could not now claim exemption as a security transaction when the parties treated the transaction as a completed sale. Thus, the court held that the transaction was not entitled to the security exemption from sales tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer contended that N.J. Stat. Ann. ch. 123 required the court to revise the taxable value of the property by applying the stipulated Tax Director's average ratio to the true value of the property. The town's position was that the ratio should have been averaged with the director's average ratios for the prior tax years involved in the proceedings and that the resulting average ratio should have been applied to all years involved. The court determined that the averaging of the Director's ratios was peculiarly within the discretion of the trier of fact. Further, the average ratio provided by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:1-35a(a) had to be used absent a showing that its use would continue unconstitutional discrimination. The court did not average the ratios for the first two years because such averaging would not stabilize the assessment of the subject property where, as had been shown, the assessment for the last year was a different amount.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff taxpayers' action that challenged the constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:8B-19, which treated a condominium unit the same as an individual residence for the purpose of local property taxes and special assessments, defendant township filed a motion for summary judgment contending that the court lacked authority to address the issue under N.J. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1, para. 1 (1947), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:3A-1, -3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The township claimed that the court was created as an inferior court of limited jurisdiction, which was limited to the same jurisdiction previously delegated to the New Jersey Division of Tax Appeals, which did not address constitutional issues. The crux of the claim rested upon the use of the word &quot;inferior&quot; in N.J. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1, para. 1, as well as in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:3A-1, and the term's deletion by a constitutional amendment. The court examined the history of the word &quot;inferior&quot; and noted the distinction between &quot;inferior courts&quot; in the technical common law meaning and in the general sense of their judgments being subject to appeal. The word &quot;inferior,&quot; as used in &sect; 1, para. 1, did not affect the capacity of constitutionally authorized courts to pass on constitutional questions, and the amendment had no impact on the judicial power of inferior courts. Because the court was a constitutionally-authorized court, its jurisdiction was not limited to that exercised by the Division, which was an administrative body created by the legislature. The court had the power to pass upon the constitutionality of a statute when the statute fell within its subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
