<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the intentional murder of two individuals and received the death penalty. Defendant appealed. The court remanded for a Batson hearing. The court held that: (1) the allowance of the imposition of the death penalty did not violate Ala. Const. art.

The court determined that defendant clearly and sufficiently brought to the attention of the trial court his objection to the prosecution's striking of black veniremen from the jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three defendants were convicted in the Pickens Circuit Court (Alabama) of knowingly obtaining unauthorized control over United States currency and checks, the property of a company and valued in excess of $ 1,000, with intent to deprive the owner thereof, a Class B felony under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-3(c). Each defendant was determined to be a recidivist with three or more previous felony convictions, and each was sentenced to imprisonment for life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter of a gas station owner witnessed three male customers drive away after seeing one of them &quot;scoop&quot; something from under the counter. Discovering a bank deposit bag missing, the owner called the sheriff and described the car, which was stopped. Defendants were arrested with a large amount of cash on them. On appeal, the court rejected defendants' argument that they were denied their constitutional rights to a fair trial and fair appeal because the trial transcript did not include the State's opening argument because they failed to raise the issue in the trial court. The court also rejected defendants' claim that the jury selection process mandated by Ala. Temp. R. Crim. P. 15.4(h) was unconstitutional. Rule 15.4(h), which governed the number of jury strikes in a criminal case, had previously been held constitutional. Nor was there merit to the argument by one defendant that the State's manner of striking jurors such that no blacks were chosen as jurors was improper. The number of strikes to which the State was entitled flowed from the consolidation of defendants' cases, to which defendants had not objected.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Montgomery County Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him of burglary in the second degree and theft of property in the second degree in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-7-6(b) (1975) and Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-4 (1975). Defendant argued that the May 1985 grand jury was without authority or jurisdiction to indict him because the February 1985 grand jury had returned a no-bill on the same charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that, following the earlier no-bill, the May 1985 indictment was void. The court affirmed and adopted the federal rule that re-submissions to the grand jury were valid without judicial approval and that an indictment after such resubmission was valid, even though no additional evidence was presented. Therefore, the May 1985 grand jury lawfully indicted defendant on the same charge for which an earlier grand jury returned a no bill. Defendant further alleged that the grand jury and trial jury which indicted and convicted him were drawn from a master jury list which was unconstitutionally formulated. He argued that because the jury list was limited to registered voters, it excluded otherwise qualified persons. The court held that because defendant did not object to the makeup of the master jury list until a month and a half after his plea of not guilty, the objection came too late. Moreover, he failed to meet his burden of showing that the jury selection process systematically and arbitrarily excluded a cognizable class from jury service.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for burglary in the second degree and theft of property in the second degree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for the capital offense of murder of a law enforcement officer. On three separate trials, the jury was unable to reach a verdict and mistrials were declared. Prior to a fourth trial, he filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, claiming that a fourth trial would violate his due process rights and double jeopardy. The court denied the petition. He was found guilty after the fourth trial, and the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the sentence and the trial court sentenced him to life without parole. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court found no ineradicable prejudice caused to defendant and he was not deprived of a fair and impartial trial. The court held that a jury's inability to agree either on a verdict or punishment was a proper reason for the declaration of a mistrial. After such a mistrial, the retrial of defendant was not barred by double jeopardy. It had also been held in Alabama that a mistrial was no trial and, therefore, that retrial did not place a defendant in double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a Roman Catholic priest, was convicted of burglary in the second degree and criminal mischief in the first degree after he unlawfully entered a medical center and destroyed equipment therein. Defendant was sentenced to probation, and as part of his probation, was ordered to stay away from all medical centers that provided abortion services and picketing or protesting within a certain radius of those centers. Defendant violated the terms of his probation by failing to observe the protesting conditions that were imposed as part of his probation. The court affirmed the revocation of defendant's probation. The court noted that the sentencing judge had broad discretion in setting probation conditions, and could lawfully impose conditions upon a party's speech, association, or assembly to preserve public order and for the protection of the accused. The conditions of defendant's probation were thus valid. The court noted that defendant could have directly appealed the sentence at the time that it was entered, but failed to do so.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that there were due process violations in regard to the blood alcohol testing and that he was improperly sentenced as a second offender. The court affirmed the conviction, reversed the sentence, and remanded. The court found that defendant was allowed a reasonable opportunity to arrange an independent test by being allowed access to a telephone. The court found nothing to suggest that police authorities thwarted defendant's attempts to obtain an independent test, and thus there was no due process violation. The court determined that the test was conducted in accordance with the methods approved by the state department of health. As to sentencing, the court found that, because a first DUI offense was punishable by up to one year of imprisonment, the State was required to establish that defendant had counsel or validly waived counsel at the time of the prior DUI conviction. The court concluded that if the State could not adduce evidence sufficient to establish the representation by counsel, or a valid waiver thereof, at the time of the prior conviction, then that prior conviction should not have been used to support enhancement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama) for driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191(a)(2) (1975). On appeal, he asserted that &sect; 32-5A-191(a)(2) was constitutionally void for vagueness, that the jury was improperly charged on an offense for which defendant was not indicted, and that the trial court erred in admitting the results of a P.E.I. test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the language in &sect; 32-5A-191(a)(2) &quot;under the influence of alcohol&quot; was unconstitutionally vague because a person of ordinary intelligence could not reasonably interpret it. He also asserted error in the trial court's charging the jury on the offense in Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191(a)(1) (1975) in addition to Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191(a)(2) (1975), with which he was charged. Defendant contested the use of the results of a P.E.I. test administered to him on the ground that the Alabama Department of Public Safety had not adopted that form of testing. On appeal, the court held that it had previously affirmed the constitutionality of Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-191(a)(2) against a vagueness argument. It also held that it was not error to charge the jury on both subsections of &sect; 32-5A-191(a) because the instructions were not a fatal variance from the complaint. The court also held that the P.E.I. results were admissible because a proper foundation was laid for the evidence. The officer's certification card was admitted into evidence, he testified that he had administered the P.E.I. test hundreds of times before, and that he checked the instrument's accuracy before testing defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1984, defendant was indicted for reckless murder under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-2 (1975) and was convicted of vehicular homicide under Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-192 as a lesser included offense. That conviction was subsequently reversed on the ground that &sect; 32A-5A-192 was unconstitutional because it provided both misdemeanor and felony punishment for the same offense. In later cases, the Alabama Supreme Court found that vehicular homicide could constitute a lesser included offense of murder and upheld &sect; 32-5A-192 as constitutional. After his conviction had been remanded to the circuit court, defendant was reindicted on an indictment charging reckless murder and vehicular homicide. Defendant moved to dismiss that indictment alleging that it placed him in jeopardy because he had already been convicted of vehicular homicide and that it was barred by the three-year statute of limitations. On appeal, the court found that defendant could not be retried for murder because his conviction of the lesser included offense of vehicular homicide was an acquittal of the offense of murder. The charge of vehicular homicide was not barred by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

Following the sentencing phase of the trial, the jury recommended that defendant receive a sentence of life imprisonment without parole.

On appeal, the court remanded the case to the trial judge with instructions that he enter specific written findings concerning the existence or nonexistence of additional evidence offered in mitigation by defendant. The court found that the trial judge did not state what evidence, if any, was considered in his determination of mitigating circumstances. The court further found, however, that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress a videotaped statement that he made while in police custody.

Before trial defense counsel requested a psychiatric examination to determine defendant's competency and defendant was found competent to stand trial.

The court found that defendant did not have a constitutional right to choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or to receive funds to hire his own. The court also found that the trial court did not err when it refused to give the jury a charge on criminally negligent homicide. The court reasoned that the failure to give the charge could not have prejudiced the defendant in any manner. Furthermore, there was no error in giving the jury an instruction on self-defense and not on accident because they were inconsistent defenses.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the local ordinance was not in conflict with the Board's regulation or Ala.

Instead, the court determined that the local ordinance merely imposed more restrictions than the Board's regulation by prohibiting topless dancing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction on the ground that the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution prohibited making the possession of child pornography in one's own home a crime and, thus, that Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-192(b) (1975), under which he was convicted, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that the possession of child pornography was not protected under the United States Constitution. The interests of the State in protecting its children from cruel physical, emotional, and physiological abuse occasioned by forcing a child to be the subject of child pornography far outweighed an interest in possessing such materials. Ala. Code &sect; 13A-12-192(b) (1975), which prohibited possession of such materials, was constitutional. The search of defendant's home for such materials was not illegal. While officers were searching his store pursuant to a search warrant, he gave consent to the search of his house.

The court opined as to whether it could pass on the error at all, however, because defense counsel failed to object to the trial court's charge on reckless murder and did not raise the issue on appeal. The court noted, following the lead of federal courts, that under Fed. R. Crim. P. 45B, the court had authority to notice obvious errors in a trial court's instructions even though Fed. R. Crim. P. 14 prohibited a party from complaining of error in the instructions absent an objection at trial. The court observed that the error was of constitutional magnitude and that it seriously affected defendant's substantial rights, depriving him of his basic constitutional right to be informed of the charges against him. The court concluded that defendant was denied due process and that the charge had an unfair prejudicial impact on the jury's deliberations, undermining the fundamental fairness of defendant's trial and resulting in a miscarriage of justice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for murder and remanded for a new trial, in which an obvious error in the jury instruction was to be eliminated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of possession of controlled substances, and his probation for four prior offenses was revoked. He appealed, arguing that his arrest, the search of his person, and the search of the automobile were unconstitutional. The court found that, while a radio dispatch from an informant, coupled with the officers' observation of the scene, supported a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot, defendant's encounter with the officers went far beyond the scope of Terry and Ala. Code &sect; 15-5-30 (1975). The court held that the evidence, viewed as a whole, did not provide a substantial basis for a finding of probable cause to arrest defendant, so the contraband contained in the vehicle was the fruit of the illegal arrest and had to be suppressed. Defendant contended that the evidence, which was the same as used in his trial, failed to prove that he violated the terms of his probation. The court held that, while it was true that the evidence of defendant's possession was obtained as the result of an illegal arrest, the district court did not commit error when it considered such evidence at the revocation hearing and based its revocation on such evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his motion for a change of venue and found him guilty.

The trial court carefully considered the statements made by the venire members in reaching its decision not to transfer the case. There was no trial atmosphere utterly corrupted by press coverage, and the racial aspects of the offense did not necessitate the granting of the motion. The direct and circumstantial evidence presented by the State was sufficient to prove every element necessary to establish a case under &sect; 13A-6-66.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of illegally possessing a pistol and appealed. Defendant maintained that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction because the State's case was based on circumstantial evidence, that &sect; 13A-11-72(a) was unconstitutional, that the Habitual Felony Offender Act did not apply, and that the State failed to produce a video tape containing exculpatory evidence. Upon review, the court upheld defendant's conviction and ruled that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's finding. The issue of possession or control of the pistol, either active or constructive, was a question of fact for the jury to resolve. The court held that, under &sect; 13A-11-72(a), ownership of the pistol was not a requirement. Rather, constructive possession of a pistol and a prior conviction for a crime of violence would support a conviction. The trial court properly applied the Habitual Felony Offender Act, as defendant's offense was classified as a Class C felony.

The court affirmed. The court severed the marital exceptions to the rape statute as having no rational basis and held that any male who engaged in sexual intercourse with any female by forcible compulsion was guilty of rape. The court determined that the child witness was not placed under oath but, it was not error because Ala. Code &sect; 15-25-3(c) (1985) provided an exception that allowed child victims of sexual abuse to testify without prior qualification. The court held that court documents showed that defendant was 56 years old at the time he committed the crimes and that age was a defense, not an element that the state was required to prove. The court held that the return of the warrant to the municipal judge who issued it, instead of to &quot;any state court,&quot; as required by Ala.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana. Defendant argued that the seizure of the marijuana from defendant's vehicle was unconstitutional. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found that the warrantless search of defendant's vehicle was justified under the plain view doctrine. The court reasoned that the police entered defendant's vehicle to secure the vehicle and defendant's belongings inside the vehicle after defendant was placed under arrest for public intoxication and that the discovery of the marijuana was made inadvertently. The court held that the discovery of the marijuana was inadvertent because none of the testimony presented suggested the officers knew in advance that marijuana was located in the vehicle or that they intended to seize it in advance. The court concluded that officer's actions in searching the vehicle plainly constituted community caretaking functions that were totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from the Supreme Court of Alabama, the court reconsidered a judgment of the trial court (Alabama), to determine whether the trial judge abused his discretion in sentencing defendant, a convicted drug-trafficker, to 15 years' imprisonment, while sentencing his co-defendants to less than five years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand from Alabama's supreme court, the court was ordered to reconsider the constitutionality and proportionality of defendant's 15-year prison sentence. Upon reconsideration, the court affirmed the sentence. Noting that substantial deference was to be granted to the sentencing authority of the legislature and the discretion of the sentencing court, the court found that defendant's sentence was constitutionally permissible and not disproportionate in the traditional sense to the crime of drug-trafficking. The court found that the circumstances, including the quantity of drugs found in defendant's possession, the extent of defendant's trafficking operation, and defendant's reputation as a drug dealer, warranted the imposition of a severe penalty. The court rejected defendant's contention the trial court imposed an unduly severe sentence in retaliation for defendant's insistence on a jury trial, noting that his co-defendants' shorter terms came about as the result of plea-bargains that occurred after defendant had already been sentenced.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-6-2 (1975), defendant was convicted in the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama) of manslaughter. On appeal, the issues included whether the manslaughter conviction was reversible because that crime was not a lesser-included offense of intentional murder and whether a 30-month delay in preparing a transcript for defendant's appeal denied him due process of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's wife died due to a lacerated liver caused by a blow to her abdomen. Several witnesses had seen defendant beating her the previous day and evening, and he admitted to having done so. On appeal, the court held that, because evidence showed that defendant was intoxicated the evening before his wife died, a jury charge on the lesser-included offense of manslaughter was proper. Most importantly, defendant had not excepted to the charge. However, despite the giving of the charge, there was no merit to defendant's argument that the jury should also have been instructed on the lesser-included offense of criminally negligent homicide. Further, defendant had not requested such an instruction, so his conviction could not be reversed on that ground. Defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied because it was based on newly discovered evidence that merely served to impeach the coroner's testimony as to the cause of death. Defendant did not allege perjury. The court held that, although the delay in preparing defendant's transcript might have violated due process principles, the appeal had been duly heard and found to lack merit.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the convictions after concluding that the police had no authority to enter the residence, make the arrests, and seize the marijuana. The court held that an arrest within a home did not provide a license for the police to search the entire residence for evidence and that the search of a residence merely because a suspect was inside did not follow as a matter of routine. Specifically, the court held that an arrest even on probable cause did not itself automatically prove exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless search of the suspects' home. Therefore, the court ruled that under the circumstances of the case, the police had no authority to enter the residence without either an arrest or search warrant and that the trial court should have granted a motion to suppress the evidence seized because the contraband constituted the &quot;fruits of the poisonous tree.&quot; Accordingly, the court concluded that the convictions had to be reversed, and that the case had to be remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama) denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea upon the ground that the applicable statutes,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 32-10-2 and 32-10-6 (1975), were unconstitutional. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While driving his car, defendant ran off the road, ran into a picnic table, and hit the victim. He then backed up his car and left the scene of the accident. Thereafter, defendant was convicted of leaving the scene of the accident. On appeal, defendant sought to withdraw his guilty plea, urging that Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 32-10-2 and 32-10-6 were unconstitutional because the latter provided for both felony and misdemeanor punishments for a violation of the former. On a rehearing of the appeal, the court explained that the fact that a statute authorized both misdemeanor and felony punishments for the same offense did not render it unconstitutional. The &quot;leaving the scene of an accident&quot; statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 32-10-2, did not violate the guarantee of Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 because, from a reading of the statute, a defendant would be reasonably apprised of the accusation against him and the possible penal consequences. Hence, the court withdrew its original opinion, substituted a new opinion based upon the new case law, and affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged under Ala. Code &sect; 22-27-4(b) for making an unauthorized dump. Defendant pleaded not guilty. After hearing the evidence, the trial court found that &sect; 22-27-4(b) was unconstitutional because it was vague, ambiguous, and unenforceable. On appeal, the court determined that Ala. Code &sect; 22-27-2(6), which defined an &quot;unauthorized dump&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague or ambiguous. Section 22-27-4(b), which declared an unauthorized dump to be a nuisance per se, was not unenforceable. That statute had actual and reasonable relation to the maintenance and promotion of the public health because the accumulation of garbage was a serious threat to the public health. Section 22-27-2(6) gave fair notice that the uncontrolled and unsupervised dumping of solid wastes was prohibited. The reach of the statute was sufficiently limited by the legislature's enumeration of certain waste items which fell within and without the prohibition of the statute.

The evidence demonstrated a lawful arrest because the sheriff had arrived to a domestic altercation involving defendant, restrained him, and was then shot.

Defendant was convicted of two counts of vehicular homicide, and he appealed. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the indictments fully apprised defendant of the crimes for which he was charged and what he must have been prepared to defend against; (2) Ala. Code &sect; 32-5A-192 (1975) was constitutional because it provided both possible misdemeanor and felony punishment for the same offense; (3) the trial judge's comment on the evidence was made as to undisputed facts, thus it was not prejudicial to defendant and did not invade the jury's fact-finding function; (4) the trial court properly refused to give instructions on contributory negligence as such was not an applicable defense in a criminal action; and (5) while the admission of defendant's statement to a doctor was proper as the questions addressed to defendant were logical, necessary, and proper to his examination and treatment, defendant's statement as to the use of alcohol and marijuana constituted an admission against his interest, the admission of which was not error, as it was merely cumulative evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate appealed a decision from the St. Clair Circuit Court (Alabama), which dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, his underlying complaint being that he had not been placed in a &quot;work release&quot; program. The inmate contended that the work release rules had been changed since he was sentenced so as to make it harder to get on work release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that the change in policies as to work release violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court disagreed and noted that the Alabama Board of Corrections, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 14-8-2 (1975), was authorized to adopt regulations and policies permitting the Alabama Commissioner of Corrections to extend the limits of the place of confinement of an inmate, and was authorized to adopt regulations as to the eligibility of those inmates. The court therefore held that changes in work release regulations were not unconstitutional. The inmate next urged that the Board improperly relied upon his prior convictions for sex offenses in denying him a reduction to a less restrictive custody status. Again, the court disagreed and found that the regulation which considered past sex related crimes in determining who should be eligible for work release status was a reasonable regulation when considered in the light of legislative policy to the same effect. Finally, the inmate contended that he had a liberty interest in work release status. The court disagreed and noted that the Alabama parole statutes did not create a liberty interest entitled to due process protection.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-11-64 (1975), for possessing a weapon with the maker's name obliterated. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it did not require criminal intent and because it proscribed innocent and lawful activity. The trial judge declared Ala. Code &sect; 13A-11-64 &quot;unconstitutional and void&quot; and dismissed the indictment. The state appealed and the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional and that, as a matter of statutory construction, the criminal intent necessary for the commission of the offense was defined in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-11-64 (1975). The court found that criminal intent should have been incorporated into Ala. Code &sect; 13A-11-64 because the modern trend among other non-federal enactments on the subject was to have required some type of mens rea. The court held that because the goal of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-11-64(2) was to prohibit the criminal possession, etc., of a firearm whose identifying marks had been obliterated, the mental state required for criminal possession, etc., should have reflected the statute's goal.</SPAN></P>

The fact that there was widespread publicity was not sufficient to require a change of venue. The court held that it was not error for the trial judge to refuse to dismiss jurors that heard a potentially prejudicial remark by the district attorney because the trial judge promptly charged the jury to disregard improper remarks. Because defendant had no protected privacy interest in the stolen car, he lacked standing to contest the constitutionality of its search. Law enforcement officials could procure a statement from defendant without notice to and consent from his attorney because defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel and his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 8-6-17 (1975). Defendant alleged that their had been irregularities in the grand jury proceedings and that the State had failed to make out a prima facie case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with having sold two notes that provided that the investors were to be paid when the company's surplus exceeded a certain amount. One note was sold under the pretense that it would replace an annuity and both were sold at a time when the company was insolvent and receiving no premium income. The grand jury inadvertently returned an indictment naming only a co-defendant. Before the jurors were discharged, this error was discovered and, with the consent of each juror, the circuit court permitted the indictment to be corrected. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court had not violated Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 12-16-190 through 12-16-233 (1975), the statutes governing grand jury proceedings. The court also held that the term &quot;willfully,&quot; as used in the Securities Act of Alabama, did not require proof of evil motive or intent to violate the law, or knowledge that the law was being violated. Intent to deceive meant intent to say something, that was expected to be relied on, that was not believed to be true, or, if true, was hoped would be understood in an untruthful sense.

On review, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and his death sentence. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the joint representation of defendant and another by an attorney in defendant's first conviction for murder did not, by itself, constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Additionally, the court held that &sect; 13-11-2 did not violate constitutional due process, equal protection, or cruel and unusual punishment provisions. Reviewing the record, the court also held that evidence established that defendant voluntarily consented to a warrantless search of his premises. The court then held that defendant's intoxication did not render his confession involuntary and that the fact that an officer allowed defendant to take a drink of alcohol when signing the confession did not constitute an improper inducement to confess.

Reprosecution on the sodomy charge did not violate double jeopardy because the factual elements of the charge were not resolved. Defendant also challenged his sodomy conviction on the basis that Ala.

The court upheld the statute but severed the exemption.

During a chase, defendant threw marijuana and cocaine out of his car. Defendant claimed that his drug possession conviction was invalid because the trial court should have granted his motion to suppress evidence. The court rejected the argument, holding that the tip from a reliable informant, defendant's reputation as a drug dealer, and his location in an area of known drug activity provided probable cause for the police to effect the arrest. Because the arrest was lawful, the search incident to that arrest was also proper. The admission into evidence of the drugs thrown from the car was proper because defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in an abandoned object. Constructive possession of the cocaine was sufficient to sustain the conviction because the facts of the arrest and chase, when considered in their totality, provided substantial evidence from which a jury could have found that defendant had been in possession of the packages. The trial court did not err when it refused to require the State to release tape recordings made of defendant.</SPAN></P>

He had been charged in a two-count indictment for the offenses of felony murder and robbery in the first degree. Defendant contended on appeal that the jury's acquittal under the first count undermined and fatally conflicted with the conviction on the second count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant testified that he did not know for a fact that there was going to be a robbery and that he did not make an agreement to rob the store or be the getaway driver. On appeal, he argued that since the verdict of acquittal found that he was not the murderer, the jury could not have consistently found that he was the robber. The court found that the record contained ample evidence of defendant's guilt for the robbery offense and that the verdicts were the products of a fair trial. Accordingly, the court found that the verdicts, even if inconsistent, should stand. The court found that probable cause existed for the arrest. It looked to the totality of the circumstances surrounding defendant's statements, including the delay in holding a probable cause hearing, to determine that defendant's statements were made voluntarily. While the length of the delay was troublesome, and while the State's procedures were highly suspect, the court was convinced that the single factor of delay did not affect the validity of the statements. Finally, the trial court had no alternative but to sentence defendant in accordance with Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-6(a)(4) because he was armed with a deadly weapon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted of capital murder committed during a kidnapping, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(1) (1975), in which he received money for assisting a husband in killing his pregnant wife. Although the jury recommended a sentence of life imprisonment without parole, the trial court found that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances and sentenced defendant to death by electrocution under the Alabama Death Penalty Act (Act), Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-39 et seq. On appeal, the court reviewed the complete record and affirmed, holding: (1) the trial court properly denied a change of venue in the absence of a showing that the setting of the trial was inherently prejudicial or that the jury selection process permitted an inference of actual prejudice; (2) the sentencing scheme under the Act was clear and eliminated arbitrariness and capriciousness in deciding whether the death penalty was to be imposed; (3) defendant was properly indicted and tried as a principal, though he may have been an accomplice or aider and abettor; and (4) the conclusions of the trial court concerning the aggravating and mitigating circumstances were fully supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The pivotal issue on appeal concerned the constitutionality of the statute the created the offense commonly referred to as leaving the scene of an accident, found at Ala.

The court noted that this precise issue was already decided in favor of the driver in a case where the court held that the duty to give information and render aid statute suffered from the same infirmity as the vehicular homicide statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for trafficking in marijuana, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-80 (1975) and the court affirmed. Defendant claimed that there was a fatal variance between the offense charged and the proof presented by the state. Essentially, defendant claimed that the indictment charged him of actual possession and the prosecution proved constructive possession. The court rejected this argument finding that the indictment did not specify whether the possession was actual or constructive. The court also rejected the argument that &sect; 20-2-80(1) was unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. The court reasoned that prior case law had determined that &sect; 20-2-80(1) was not unconstitutionally vague or indefinite as to its sentencing scheme or violative of the separation of powers doctrine of Ala. Const. art. III, &sect; 43. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the destruction of the marijuana prior to trial denied him a fair trial. All parties believed the substance was marijuana, defendant never requested access to the evidence until the date of trial, and there was no claim of improper governmental motive for the destruction.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13-11-2(a)(10) after a jury trial and sentenced him to death pursuant to &sect; 13-11-2(a). Thereafter, the trial court conducted a sentencing hearing pursuant to &sect; 13-11-3 et seq. After making specific findings on the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the trial court sentenced defendant to death by electrocution. Defendant appealed. The court noted that defendant's arrest did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV because there was probable cause for the warrantless arrest. The test of probable cause was the same under the Fourth Amendment as under Alabama law. The court concluded, after reviewing the testimony of all those involved, that the officers made a warrantless but consensual entry into defendant's apartment and that, therefore, the items obtained during the warrantless search of the apartment were not erroneously admitted into evidence. The court concluded that defendant received a fair trial. However, due to the deficiencies in the sentencing order, the court remanded the cause to the trial court with directions.</SPAN></P>

The police stopped the car defendant and the other individual was in. One of the officers observed a brown paper sack thrown from the passenger side of the car lying about five feet from the car. The court affirmed. The court held there was sufficient evidence defendant was in actual or constructive possession of the marijuana, and that he knew of the presence of the substance. The court held although defendant contended the passenger tossed the sack out of the car, a driver was generally considered to be in control of it and an inference of constructive possession existed. The court also held police had probable cause to stop defendant's car because there was evidence the car was speeding, in addition to being suspected of possessing marijuana.

Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his prior bad acts and in refusing to give two requested jury instructions. The appellate court rejected these contentions. The indictment charging defendant with knowingly possessing 28 grams or more of cocaine was sufficient. The trial court's determination of the quantity of cocaine defendant possessed, for sentencing purposes, did not deny defendant his right to jury trial. Defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because there was probable cause for his arrest upon which a later inventory search was predicated. Evidence of defendant's prior drug sales was admissible to show his plan, scheme, or ongoing business system to engage in the illegal sale of drugs. The trial court did not err in rejecting defendant's requested jury instructions regarding the distinction between types of cocaine and the reasonable doubt standard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the crime of robbery when the victim was intentionally killed. He was sentenced to death by electrocution. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that it was reasonable to conclude that defendant decided to admit to shooting the victim when confronted with the evidence against him. A review of the totality of the circumstances convinced the court that the appropriate constitutional procedures were followed, defendant's threshold oral statement to the police was voluntary, and that the statement was made after a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of his Miranda rights. The court further found that the trial court did not err in admitting photographs of the victim's body into evidence. Finally, the court upheld defendant's sentence, finding: (1) there was no evidence that the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; (2) upon consideration of the aggravating and mitigating factors, death was an appropriate sentence; and (3) considering the crime committed and defendant, the death sentence was neither excessive nor disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that it was proper to consolidate the cases when defendant did not timely file a motion to sever as required by the published docket. The court found that the lower court did not err in denying defendant's request for a continuance the morning of trial. The court determined that defendant was sentenced to two life sentences based on the finding that he was a habitual offender. The court stated that the lower court erred in not requiring proof that defendant was the same man who committed the other crimes and not just someone with a similar name, and the court remanded the issue for determination of whether defendant was a habitual offender for sentencing purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder during the commission of a robbery and sentenced to death. On appeal, he raised 24 alleged errors, most of which pertained to the empanelling of the death-qualified jury and the instructions provided to them regarding the mitigating and aggravating factors presented for their consideration. The court found that the jury was properly empaneled and that a jury was properly excluded from serving on the jury because of his views on the death penalty and his inability to perform is duty as a juror. Further, the court found that the trial court had properly denied defendant's requests to charge the jury because the requested charges were either covered by other charges or clearly erroneous. In particular the court found that the jury could return the death penalty if it found that he aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. Finally, the court determined that the death penalty was proper because no error had been shown, the findings concerning the aggravating and mitigating circumstances were supported by the evidence, and sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 3-1-29 (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that Ala. Code &sect; 3-1-29 (1975) was void for vagueness and therefore unconstitutional, that it had been applied to him ex post facto, and that the trial court erred in permitting the state to present inflammatory evidence concerning the condition of the dogs when confiscated from him. The court affirmed the judgment. The court stated that &sect; 3-1-29 was not unconstitutionally vague, noting that otherwise innocent conduct was protected in that minimal guidelines had been established to aid law enforcement officials and triers of fact in determining what conduct was prohibited, and that it conveyed a sufficient and definite meaning and warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice. The court held that defendant's ex post facto claim was without merit because there was sufficient evidence before the jury to convict him of activities after the effective date of &sect; 3-1-29. The court stated that the testimony on the dogs' conditions and propensity for viciousness was relevant to prove the issue of intent to fight the dogs, and found no abuse of the trial court's discretion in admitting it.</SPAN></P>

The legislature had created two different offenses which could apply to defendant's conduct in the instant cause, and therefore the State did not err in electing to prosecute him for murder.

The trial court found the company in violation of &sect; 13A-12-1 but, on appeal, held that the legislation was vague, ambiguous, and uncertain and that there was discriminatory enforcement of the laws. The trial court granted the company's motion to dismiss. The court affirmed. Application of &sect; 13A-12-1 to the company amounted to an unequal, invidious, and discriminatory enforcement of the law. There was also an unequal enforcement of &sect; 13A-12-1 in that a number of various retail stores operating as large chain drug stores were selling a variety of items of general merchandise along with prescription drugs and drug-related items. It was not disputed that many of the large chain drug stores sold many of the same items of general merchandise as did the company.

The court found that counsel was not ineffective for failing to interview a potential witness because the inmate failed to furnish counsel with information that might have lead him to interview the witness and, in any event, the inmate indicated that the witness had nothing to offer in his defense. The court also found that the inmate suffered no prejudice as a result of counsel's failure to make a record on the systematic exclusion of African-Americans from the jury or to pursue the matter on appeal. Further, the court found that counsel's decision not to pursue a defense based on the inmate's mental condition was a reasonable exercise of professional judgment.

Defendant argued that due to his age and limited intellectual capacities, he could not have intelligently, knowingly, and voluntarily waived his rights. The court affirmed, holding that the confession was completely voluntarily given and that defendant properly waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The evidence disclosed that defendant had an I.Q. of from 70 to 85, which was in the &quot;dull normal, dull average&quot; range of intelligence; that he did not suffer from any psychoses, neuroses, or organic brain problems; that he knew what was going on; that he was of average physical condition; that he had completed the eighth grade in school; and that he initiated and requested a visit from the officer to whom he gave his confession. The court also held that there was sufficient evidence presented to allow the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioner's conviction for capital murder was reversed, he was reindicted and he again pleaded guilty. The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the petition for writ of error coram nobis, holding that such a petition was not the appropriate method for seeking review of a claim that the accused had not been apprised of his constitutional rights at the time he entered his guilty plea. Because the case involved a capital offense, a jury had to determine petitioner' guilt or innocence. Although petitioner entered a plea of guilty to a capital offense and was sentenced to life without parole, he was not entitled to withdraw that guilty plea and obtain a new trial on the basis of subsequently decided caselaw which provided that a sentence of death could not be constitutionally imposed after a jury verdict of guilt of capital murder when the jury was not permitted to consider a verdict of guilt of any lesser included noncapital offense. Further, because petitioner stipulated that he stabbed or cut the deceased, numerous times, thereby causing the death, his allegation that he did not understand that intent was an element of the offense was absurd.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after selling a large quantity of marijuana to an undercover officer. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-8(1) was not unconstitutionally vague or indefinite as to its sentencing scheme or violative of the separation of powers doctrine of Ala. Const. art. III, &sect; 43. Marijuana was held to be identical with cannabis, as it was merely a geographically oriented name for cannabis. In light of fact that the indictment charged possession of &quot;marijuana,&quot; which was the older, more general term comprehending chemical characteristics of the cannabis plant, and did not charge possession of &quot;marihuana,&quot; the term which was used in the Uniform Controlled Substances Act and which substituted taxonomic definitive nomenclature to define prohibited substance as being all parts of the plant Cannabis Sativa L., defendant was apprised by indictment that he was accused of possessing substances containing the incriminating ingredient of tetrahydrocannabinol.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of harassment in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-11-8 (1975). On appeal, defendant argued that the harassment statute was void for vagueness because it did not define the tern &quot;alarm, annoy, or harass&quot; in any objective manner. The court held that &sect; 13A-11-8 was constitutional because the statute was not completely subjective because the statute required that the touching have been done with an intent to harass, annoy, or alarm. The State was entitled to have shown why and for what purpose the officers were at the trailer. However, the trial court properly excluded evidence of the contraband discovered in the search of the trailer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police found defendant being held down by the witness who stated that he was hurting her kids. Subsequently, in attempting to part defendant from the witness, police observed what appeared to be drugs falling from defendant's possession. At trial, the State elicited the witness's statement from the police officer during his testimony. Defense counsel objected to the admission of the statement and filed a motion for a mistrial. The trial court overruled the objection and denied the motion. Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of a controlled substance. He was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment after the invocation by the State of the Habitual Felony Offenders Act (Act). On appeal, the court found that the trial court should have stricken the answer of the police officer as to what the witness said, but the trial court was not in error in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial. The court also found that the range of punishment as enhanced by his two previous felony convictions under the Act was for life or not more than 99 years or less than 10 years, so the trial judge was not materially influenced by the Act in fixing defendant's punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal form his conviction, defendant argued that the testimony of his admitted accomplice was inadequately corroborated to sustain a guilty verdict, that the trial court erred in admitting a sawed-off barrel portion of a 20-gauge shotgun where the murder weapon was never found, and that the trial court improperly excluded impeachment evidence against the accomplice. In affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court held: 1) the trial court properly determined that sufficient evidence corroborated the accomplice's testimony based on trial testimony placing defendant and his accomplice together before and after the crime and regarding defendant's possession of a sawed-off shotgun on the night of the murder; 2) although there was no direct proof linking the exhibit to the murder weapon, there was sufficient foundation to support the inference linking defendant with the exhibit and showing defendant in possession of a sawed-off shotgun on the night of the murder; 3) prior juvenile adjudications against the accomplice were not admissible for impeachment purposes; and 4) the death sentence was property imposed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court's ruling as to voluntariness of the confession was supported by substantial evidence.

Code &sect; 13A-8-17 (1975). Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to support defendant's conviction where there were several circumstances which afforded the reasonable inference that defendant had reasonable grounds to believe that jewelry he purchased was stolen. The court noted that defendant purchased merchandise from the same person on 22 different occasion for far less than the retail value of the items and that most of the merchandise sold to defendant was brand new. The court held that a municipal ordinance requiring gold and silver dealers to report their transactions to the police did not absolve defendant from making reasonable inquiry as to whether the goods were stolen. The court concluded that defendant could not have been found guilty of theft in the third degree because he was a dealer and Ala. Code &sect; 13-8-18(a)(2) stated the minimum degree for which a dealer could be convicted was receiving stolen property in the second-degree.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-6-65(a)(3) was unconstitutional. The trial court specifically found that &sect; 13A-6-65(a)(3), on its face, was &quot;overinclusive and overbroad&quot; because of particular language disallowing consent as a defense to the charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the misdemeanor offense of sexual misconduct prohibited by Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-65(a)(3). Section13A-6-65(a)(3) described prohibited sexual misconduct and specifically stated that consent was no defense to prosecution. The trial court dismissed the complaint and the court reversed. The court found that the trial court inappropriately invoked the overbreadth doctrine and improperly held &sect; 13A-6-65(a)(3) invalid on its face. One who challenged a statute as unconstitutionally overbroad was required to be directly affected by the statute's alleged overbroad aspects. The trial court should have confined itself to deciding the constitutionality of the statute only as it applied to defendant, rather than permitting defendant to assert alleged rights of non-litigants to whom the statute might be applied. Defendant did not claim or argue that his right to privacy was violated by the statute's application to him. The court held that he did not meet his burden of demonstrating that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. The court held that the transcript was totally devoid of evidence indicating that defendant's right to privacy was violated.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment. Specifically, the court first determined that a stipulation by defense counsel to the prior felony convictions was sufficient to prove the prior convictions. Thus, the trial court properly sentenced defendant as a habitual felony offender. Secondly, the court emphasized that it had repeatedly upheld the constitutionality of Alabama's Habitual Felony Offender Act. Moreover, the court noted that it was universally held that a voluntary plea of guilty waived all non-jurisdictional defects. Lastly, the court determined that, after consultation with his attorney, defendant waived his request for a psychiatric examination.

On appeal, the court ruled that defendant was not entitled to a new trial based upon his claim that he was convicted on perjured testimony, because he failed to establish that the testimony was perjured and that the State knew of the perjury. Furthermore, there was sufficient evidence to support his conviction even without the alleged perjured testimony. In addition, the trial court did not err in refusing to continue his trial when a defense witnesses failed to appear where defendant, after learning of the witness's absence, continued to call other witnesses and did not ask for a continuance at that time in order to invoke a ruling from the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attempted to withdraw money from two banks using forged savings account withdrawal slips. He was convicted of possession of a forged instrument in the second degree. The trial court sentenced him to life in prison under the Act, with possibility of parole, because he had four prior felony convictions. On appeal, the court held that defendant's sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment because it was proportional in view of his prior felony convictions for crimes that presented &quot;potentialities for violence.&quot; Further, the court held that a bank withdrawal slip was an instrument, within the meaning of Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 13A-9-1, 13A-9-3(1) (1975), which would support a forgery conviction under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-9-6 (1975). The court noted that a withdrawal slip evidenced, transferred, or otherwise affected a legal right, interest, obligation, or status. The court held that defendant was not denied effective assistance of trial counsel simply because his counsel may not have objected to every question or moved to strike every answer. The court found that defendant's counsel performed sufficiently well, but that the State's evidence against defendant was very compelling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the legal right of the State to confine him in prison because the conditions under which he was confined constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of his rights guaranteed by U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV and Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 15. Defendant appealed a decision of the Elmore Circuit Court (Alabama), which summarily dismissed his habeas petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that he was held in dangerous, crowded, and unsanitary conditions and that the State had failed to take proper actions, under federal court order, to alleviate the conditions. The court affirmed the judgment denying the writ. The court noted that relief sought from alleged cruel and unusual treatment in the prison system was not cognizable under a writ of habeas corpus and that the appropriate remedy for the claim of illegal conditions of confinement, if proven, would not have been release from custody. The basis for defendant's writ was not confinement, but his treatment by prison officials. Defendant's allegations were subject to judicial review, but because they did not relate to the legality of defendant's confinement or the sufficiency of the legal proceedings resulting in the confinement, habeas corpus was not the appropriate avenue of relief. The court rejected defendant's contention that the abolishment of the Board of Corrections of the State of Alabama and the placing of the prison system under the authority of the governor rendered his confinement illegal because the legislature was authorized to change that authority.</SPAN></P>

The Board had revoked the prisoner's Alabama parole and lodged a detainer with the State of Georgia, requesting that the prisoner be returned to the Alabama prison system upon his release in Georgia.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was convicted or murder and assault with intent to murder in Alabama. He was later convicted of murder in Georgia. After serving part of the Alabama sentence, the prisoner was paroled in Alabama and transferred to Georgia to serve his life sentence imposed there. As a condition of his Alabama parole, the prisoner waived his extradition rights and agreed to be returned to Alabama at any time. The Board learned that it did not have a complete investigative file on the prisoner and had not followed the explicit statutory scheme in performing its functions as a parole grantor. The Board revoked the parole due to the failure to have a complete investigative file at the time of its initial action. The prisoner appealed the revocation. The lower court affirmed the revocation, and the court, on appeal, affirmed. Under Ala. Code &sect; 15-22-25, the Board was required to have a complete file on the prisoner's social and criminal record before granting parole. The court found that the prisoner had no liberty interest in the parole. The parole was not revoked in violation of the prisoner's due process rights because it was illegal in the first place.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was fined $ 500 and sentenced to five days in the city jail. The court affirmed the conviction, finding that the title to the act that increased the penalties for driving while under the influence of alcohol, 1983 Ala. Acts 83-620, complied with Ala. Const. art. 4, &sect; 45 because it contained but one subject that was clearly expressed in the title. The court found that it was not appropriate to discuss whether defendant was denied his right to bail by the U.S. Const. amends. VIII and XIV because the provision that he would not be released until his blood alcohol level was below the legal limit did not have any material bearing on whether defendant was guilty of driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. The trial court was not in error for overruling defendant's motion to suppress evidence of the results of the analysis of defendant's breath to determine the percentage of alcohol in his blood because he had the burden to show that there was a scientifically developed means by which a breath sample can be preserved for later testing.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-5-31(a)(2) (1975). Defendant asserted that the arresting officers had no probable cause to search him, that statements he made to the officers were improperly admitted into evidence, and that the prosecution made improper statements at the closing arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of intentional murder in the course of a robbery, contrary to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-31(a)(2) (1975). The decision was affirmed by the court, which noted that under Ala. Code &sect; 15-5-30 (1975), a police officer could stop any person in a public place that he suspected was about to commit a felony. This assumed that the officer observed unusual conduct that led him reasonably to conclude that criminal activity was afoot. Further, no search warrant was required for a search incident to a lawful arrest. Although defendant asserted that his confession was inadmissible because he was not advised of his Miranda rights, the court noted that the Miranda safeguards did not apply to traditional investigatory functions such as general on-the-scene questioning. The court also noted that defendant's intoxication would not render his confession inadmissible unless it amounted to a mania that impaired him to the point that he was unconscious of the meaning of his words. The court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's decision finding that prosecutorial closing remarks were not improper and noted that the jury had properly weighed the evidence in convicting defendant.</SPAN></P>

During his argument, the prosecutor made a comment that defendant was not paying his social security and state and federal taxes and occupational taxes. The circuit court overruled defendant's objection to that argument. The court held that that argument was improper because there was no testimony regarding defendant's occupation. The court held that it was not fair to accuse defendant in closing argument with crimes with which he was not charged. The court reversed defendant's conviction because remarks by the prosecutor that accused defendant of the commission of a crime other than that for which he was on trial and that were unsupported by any evidence, required reversal.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found him guilty. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that, pursuant to Ala.

The court also ruled he waived contentions that the trial court committed reversible error by denying a motion to suppress evidence and the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional. The court held the potential death sentence of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(a)(4) and Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-40(10) was not cruel and unusual punishment. The statutes were not unconstitutional since they were conceived throughout judicial legislation, and a contention it could result in the arbitrary application of the death penalty was not supported by authority.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was transferred from the juvenile court to the adult division of the trial court. During the time that defendant had perfected his appeal of the transfer order but before the appellate court had ruled on the appeal, a grand jury issued an indictment against him. Defendant was convicted of manslaughter by a jury and the trial court imposed an enhanced sentence for defendant's use of a deadly weapon. The transfer order was affirmed by an appellate court. On appeal, the court held that the grand jury had authority to indict him while defendant's appeal of the transfer order was pending. The court explained that an appeal of a juvenile court's transfer order did not deprive an adult criminal court of jurisdiction to receive an indictment against defendant. The court held that the trial court did not lose jurisdiction during the pendency of the appeal. The court determined that the trial court's instruction regarding lesser included offenses was erroneous but that the objectionable portion was cured by the instructions as a whole. The court rejected defendant's argument that his enhanced sentence under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-6(a)(5) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, but on remand was required to determine the necessity of remanding the action to the trial court for a new trial or a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On remand, the court had to determine whether or not any guilt-finding phase errors necessitated a completely new trial. The court found that the indictment was not fatally defective because it lacked an averment about the time of the offense. Then, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by not striking all of the jurors that had knowledge of defendant's prior convictions. The voir dire examinations did not demonstrate that any of the non-stricken jurors were biased against defendant. Also, the police officers had reasonable cause to believe that defendant committed the crime because they observed that his truck matched the one described at the crime scene, found bloody boots in plain view, and observed other suspicious behavior that justified defendant's warrantless arrest. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence and confession from his arrest. Finally, the trial court's instructions to the jury were adequate. Thus, the court found no errors prejudicial to defendant in the guilt-phase proceedings of his trial and affirmed his capital murder conviction. It remanded the action to the trial court only for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's entry of judgment convicting defendant. The court remanded the action with directions for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's initial conviction was reversed because the jury was not instructed on the lesser-included offenses. Defendant was not entitled to dismissal of the indictment on grounds of double jeopardy because the error did not concern the sufficiency of evidence, or the validity of the conviction. Defendant also contended that his Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination was not violated by taking a blood sample. Admission into evidence of results of analysis of blood, drawn from defendant, was not violative of the Fifth Amendment privilege, since the evidence was not of a testimonial or communicative nature.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested in June 1980, for the strangulation death of an elderly woman. He was indicted twice. He was tried for capital murder in May 1982, but the jury convicted him on the lesser-included offense of murder. At the trial, some 40 photographs depicting the victim and the crime scene were introduced into evidence by the State. On appeal, the court affirmed the murder conviction and sentence imposed and held that defendant was accorded a fair trial. The court held: (1) that there was no violation of his right to a speedy trial because the delay was not purposeful or prejudicial in that defendant had waived his right for several months, had failed to make it known that he was desiring a speedy trial, and that a significant portion of the delay was attributable to defendant; (2) that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the State's photographs because the photographs potential for prejudice was outweighed by the desirable effect of aiding the jury in understanding the testimony of witnesses; and (3) that there was no prejudicial error in admitting evidence from the search of defendant's residence because there was probable cause for the search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by the Lee Circuit Court (Alabama) for theft in the second degree for passing a bad check and his sentence to 50 years' imprisonment as an habitual offender. He contended that the evidence did not sustain the conviction and that it was unconstitutional for the district attorney to prosecute him for theft, a felony, when the majority of bad checks were prosecuted as misdemeanors under Alabama's &quot;bad check law.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly convinced a store owner that he owned a motel and wished to buy two television sets. The owner accepted a check, which was returned by the bank. When the owner tried to contact defendant, he found that defendant no longer lived at the address on the check, and he contacted the police. The bank bookkeeper testified that defendant's account was always overdrawn and was finally closed. Defendant claimed that he did not intend to deceive the owner and expected money to be deposited in his account sufficient to cover the check. Defendant was convicted of theft, and the court affirmed. First, there was sufficient evidence to satisfy the elements of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-2 (1975). It was clear that defendant obtained the televisions by deceit with the intent to deprive the owner of them because defendant knowingly made a promise he did not intend for perform or knew would not be performed. Second, since the laws provided that two different criminal offenses, felony theft or misdemeanor passing bad checks, were committed in defendant's single act, the State could elect to prosecute defendant under either statute, and prosecuting defendant for a felony was not improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's second trial, the trial court denied his motion for change of venue. One evening during the jury's deliberations, they announced that they were hopelessly deadlocked. The trial court concluded that they were tired and might reach a unanimous verdict the next day. They did and defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court remanded with directions for the trial court to enter specific written findings concerning the aggravating circumstances enumerated in Ala. Code &sect; 13-11-6 (1975), the mitigating circumstances in Ala. Code &sect; 13-11-7 (1975), and any additional mitigating circumstances. The court rejected all of defendant's other challenges to the verdict. The court found that the trial court's denial of defendant's change of venue motion was not an abuse of its discretion. The court determined that there was nothing improper in the trial court's refusal to strike prospective jurors solely because they had heard of defendant's prior conviction or sentence. The court also noted that a trial court was fully authorized to urge a jury to resume deliberations as long as it did not suggest which way the verdict should be returned and no duress or coercion was used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder, and she appealed. The court affirmed her conviction. The court held that it was not error for the trial court to permit the state to use its peremptory challenges to exclude all black females from the jury. Defendant offered no proof by way of statistics, facts, or testimony from any witness that there existed any continued and systematic exclusion of blacks from petit juries. There was ample evidence whereby the trial court could have determined that defendant's confession to the police was voluntarily given. The trial court did not err when it admitted photographs of a knife which killed defendant's victim. Testimony of the state's witness established that the photographs correctly depicted the scene at the time they were taken. Both the knife and the victim's body were certainly relevant in the trial. Defendant's sentence of 20 years in the penitentiary under Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-6(a)(4) (1975) was proper. Defendant could not complain of a chart used by the trial court in its oral charge to the jury when no objection was made to the trial court. The trial court did not abuse its discretion during the prosecutor's closing argument.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were returned to the store, approximately 30 minutes after the robbery, and were identified by the victims. Over one defendant's motion to sever, the cases were consolidated. On appeal, the court ruled, inter alia, that: (1) Ala. R. Civ. P. 15, the rule pertaining to joinder, was not unconstitutionally vague; (2) joinder of defendants and the cases was appropriate because it was alleged that defendants participated jointly in a single transaction involving a robbery of two persons; (3) the defendant who sought severance was not prejudiced by the three month interval between arrest and trial; (4) the Habitual Felony Offender Statute was constitutional as applied to the defendant who challenged the statute on Eight Amendment grounds; and (5) the evidence tags for the stolen guns were not subject to the best evidence rule, as that rule applied only to documentary evidence, and thus they were properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

On certiorari the United States Supreme Court vacated the state court's decision and remanded the matter for further consideration in light of a recent decision which found the state's capital punishment statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he should have been granted a new trial either because the evidence presented at trial supported a non-capital felony murder conviction or because he should have been given the opportunity to present additional evidence of possible lesser included offenses, an opportunity he did not have at trial as his case was tried before the preclusion clause was removed from the Alabama Death Penalty Act. Defendant presented only an alibi defense, and all of the state's evidence--though circumstantial--supported the capital felony charged in the indictment. Thus, the court found that the evidence presented would not have supported a conviction for a lesser included offense. The court further found that the alibi defense directly contradicted any evidence which defendant might later produce to show that he was guilty of a lesser included offense. Thus, a retrial was not required due to the subsequent finding by the United States Supreme Court that the preclusion clause of Ala. Code &sect; 13-5-31 was unconstitutional. Additionally, the court held that the absence of a bifurcated trial before the jury was not grounds for reversal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further argued that he was not afforded reasonable notice that he was to be sentenced under the habitual offender statute and that the statute was violative of the constitutional provisions for due process and equal protection. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that defendant was told by the trial court at a hearing of the possible punishments he could receive and that his claim that he was coerced was properly rejected. The court further held that during the hearing at which defendant pleaded guilty, he made no objection regarding the inadequacy of the notice given to proceed under the habitual offender statute.

On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the testimony of the woman clearly established that she was the victim of a robbery in the first degree and that defendant, who was armed with a rifle, threatened her with the imminent use of force in order to acquire her property. The court stated that having received a sentence of life without parole rather than the death penalty, and having produced no evidence that the statute was unconstitutionally applied to him, defendant could not argue that the death penalty procedures of the statute were unconstitutional as applied to others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for possessing more than 2.2 pounds of cannabis. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding no error in admitting testimony about cocaine seen in defendant's pocket before his arrest because evidence of other drugs was permissible where it showed the complete story. The court ruled that &sect; 20-2-80 was within the legislature's authority to identify a strict liability offense by defining possession of more than 2.2 pounds of cannabis as trafficking, a felony, regardless of the possessor's intent. The court found no due process or equal protection violation because the classification in &sect; 20-2-80 was not arbitrary and was rationally related to the State's interest in curbing drug sales. The court ruled that it had no authority to question whether the statute was the best means to achieve the desired result because it was properly enacted and within the power and discretion of the legislature. The court found that the enactment of &sect; 20-2-80, providing that it repealed all conflicting laws, in effect amending other statutes, did not violate Ala. Const. &sect; 45 because the act was complete in itself and the implied amendments were necessary to implementing &sect; 20-2-80.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court should suppress an in-court identification made by a witness based on the suggestive procedures used prior to trial and that the trial court should have suppressed his confession that was involuntary and should not have sentenced him under the Alabama Habitual Felony Offender Act, because the records from his prior convictions failed to name the attorney representing him. Defendant also claimed that the Act was unconstitutional. The court held that the factual basis upon which the witness identified defendant showed that the witness's identification was credible and had not been suggested. The court additionally held that it was not necessary for defendant to sign a written waiver of his rights for his confession to be admissible. The court further determined that it was unnecessary for the name of defendant's attorney to be stated in the record of his prior convictions and the evidence that defendant had been convicted previously of robbery, false impersonation and false pretense, and second degree forgery was sufficient to satisfy the imposition of a sentence under the Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he was discovered in a warehouse after closing hours, but offered a defense of intoxication as an excuse in his trial for third degree burglary.

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence given in the case for a conviction for a third degree burglary. The court determined that intoxication was a matter of common observation that required no peculiar scientific knowledge so that any witness who was asked to express an opinion as to defendant's intoxication was properly qualified. The court also determined that the sentencing procedure followed under the Alabama Habitual Offender Act did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment by retroactively imposing additional punishment for offenses previously committed.</SPAN></P>

The store director requested them to leave the premises. They refused. The police requested them to leave. They refused. Defendants were convicted of criminal trespass in the third degree. On appeal, the court affirmed. First, the court held that the state law on trespass, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-7-4 (1975), was not preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. Defendants were not employees of the store. There was no evidence that the employees of the store could only have been reached while on the employer's premises. Defendants, who were not store employees, had no right to engage in organizational solicitation on the store premises when the store employees could have been reached elsewhere. Next, the court held that the language of &sect; 13A-7-4 was not impermissibly vague or overbroad. The court also rejected defendants' contention that &sect; 13A-7-4 violated their rights of equal protection.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Ala. &sect; 13A-5-6(a)(5) (1975), the statute under which defendant was convicted of manslaughter, was unconstitutional and therefore her conviction should be reversed. She argued that &sect; 13A-5-6(a)(5) violated the equal protection clause because the minimum sentence for both Class B and C felonies was the same. Section 13A-5-6(a)(5) provided that for a Class B or C felony in which a firearm or deadly weapon was used or attempted to be used in the commission of a felony, not less than 10 years. A prior decision of the court determined that the term of imprisonment for a Class B felony was 10 to 20 years and for a Class C felony the sentence was exactly 10 years. The court found that the classifications under the statute were not arbitrary and that they were equally applied to all convicted thereunder; thus, there was no equal protection violation. The court found that the legislature was permitted to determine sentencing ranges and the fact that a trial court had no discretion in administering a sentence did not deny a defendant convicted under the statute due process.</SPAN></P>

Following a habitual offender hearing at which six prior felonies were placed in evidence, defendant was sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with having a pistol in his possession or under his control in violation of Ala. Code &sect;13A-11-72(a) (1975), after having been convicted of the offense of grand larceny. A police officer saw defendant's car emerge from behind a group of buildings in a very dark area. Defendant sped up and drove in an evasive manner. The officer stopped defendant's car and saw a gasoline container and a hose on the back seat. The officer saw a pistol lying on the floorboard of defendant's car. Defendant had no identification. The officer was aware there had been some burglaries in the area within the months prior to the time of making the arrest. The court rejected defendant's argument that the officer acted without probable cause in stopping his car and that the incriminating evidence found in the car was illegally obtained and, thus, inadmissible. The court found that the arrest of defendant was pursuant to an investigative stop and was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Walker Circuit Court (Alabama) for criminal possession of explosives.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court concluded that Ala. Code &sect; 13A-7-44 (1975) was not void for vagueness. The statute conveyed a sufficient and definite meaning and warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and practice. It was also not vague and indefinite for failure to define the term &quot;explosives&quot; in that particular section because the term was defined in the new Alabama Criminal Code. The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting a plastic bottle with a cigarette lighter taped to its side. The requirement for admissibility was only that the article be in &quot;substantially the same condition&quot; as when the crime was committed, not the exact same condition. The issue of the fire chief's qualifications to testify as an expert was not raised at trial, and the motion to exclude the testimony, being made before any testimony was given or objection made, was premature. There was no material variance between the indictment describing a glass bottle and the proof showing a plastic bottle so as to have affected defendant's substantial rights or have been substantially injurious to him in making his defense.</SPAN></P>

There was no abuse in the trial court's refusal to allow defense counsel to publicly question a member of the victim's family in open court in the presence of the jury venire during the voir dire of that venire.

The court found that the length of the delay was presumptively prejudicial. However, there was a legitimate, justifiable reason for the post-indictment delay. After defendant was indicted for this robbery, he was charged with a capital offense. He was later convicted and sentenced to death. That conviction was subsequently overturned. Even so, the existence of the death sentence justified the delay. The Sixth Amendment did not require that defendant be brought to trial for a non-capital offense while he was incarcerated under a death sentence. Also, defendant never made a demand for trial on the robbery indictment. Finally, defendant suffered no prejudice. Defendant made general arguments about his inability to locate witnesses. The court held that that was insufficient to show prejudice. Therefore, defendant's right to speedy trial was not violated. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for mistrial because the prosecutor's remarks regarding a witness' identification of defendant were rendered innocuous by the trial court's instructions.</SPAN></P>

The State's theory was that defendant had hired or caused a third party to kill her husband. The jury returned a guilty verdict only as to the lesser included offense of murder. Affirming, the court ruled that any error that resulted from premature admission of statements by defendant's cohorts was cured by the State's subsequent proof of a conspiracy. The court found no error in the trial court's refusal to grant a mistrial based on a comment by the prosecutor because the comment was only a comment upon the evidence during trial, was not an attempt to allude to defendant's testimony or silence, and was not so grossly improper and highly prejudicial as to have been ineradicable. The court found no merit to defendant's contention that the trial court erred in failing to excuse for cause a juror that had an alleged impermissible interest because no testimony was presented to the trial court, prior to trial, or on motion for new trial, that demonstrated the cause for bias asserted by defendant on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The main question on appeal was whether there was sufficient evidence at the conclusion of the State's case in chief for the jury to reasonably conclude that defendant was an accomplice and knew that his partner had a gun. The evidence showed that defendant had made the initial contact with the employee at the jewelry store, and it was he who brought the partner, who actually committed the robbery, to the store to meet the employee. The employee testified, without objection, that based from the actions and demeanor of defendant and his partner while they were in the jewelry store earlier that day, he feared they &quot;might want to rob the place.&quot; The police officers, without objection, characterized the action of defendant during the time of the robbery as that of a lookout. Also, at the time the officer stopped and arrested the partner, defendant immediately ran. When the evidence was considered in the light most favorable to the State, there was sufficient basis for the jury to reasonably conclude that defendant did aid and abet the partner in the robbery and that defendant knew that the partner had a gun. The motion to exclude the State's evidence was, therefore, properly denied.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-5-31(a)(10) (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erroneously denied his motion for a change of venue or, in the alternative, for a continuance. The court found that defendant had not carried his burden of showing that an impartial trial and an unbiased verdict could not be expected in the locality. The prospective jurors were questioned extensively in six separate panels. While some had read newspaper articles related to the case, none indicated that he had pre-judged the case solely as a result of the newspaper publicity. The prospective jurors who did have a fixed opinion of defendant's guilt were all successfully challenged for cause. Of the jurors who had any relationship with the decedents, their relatives, or the special prosecutor, all stated that they would not allow the relationships to affect their impartiality, and they would decide the case on the evidence alone. It was not prosecutorial misconduct to call defendant's wife to the stand to have her assert her spousal privilege to refuse to testify. The trial court properly concluded that the issue of defendant's sanity at the time of the shooting was a disputed question of fact best left to the jury to resolve.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified, in essence, that defendant, whom she had known several years, raped her at his home. Defendant's defense was that of consent. On appeal, defendant attacked the rape shield statute on the ground that it was void for vagueness, violated his right to due process and his right to confront the witnesses against him, and it denied him equal protection of the laws. The court rejected defendant's arguments and affirmed his conviction. The court found that (1) Ala. Code &sect; 12-21-203 (Supp. 1982) was not so incomplete or irreconcilably conflicting or so vague and indefinite that it cannot be executed, nor was a court unable to determine with any reasonable degree of certainty what the legislature intended; (2) defendant's right of confrontation necessarily included the right to cross-examine witnesses, but that right did not extend to matters which were irrelevant and had little or no probative value; and (3) the rape shield statute sustained an equal protection challenge because there was a rational and reasonable basis for the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants both entered guilty pleas to indictments charging them with second degree burglary. Upon their convictions, they were sentenced as habitual felony offenders pursuant to the Act. They then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and the trial court denied the petition without an evidentiary hearing on the State's motion. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the Act was constitutional and did not violate the prohibition on ex post facto laws because it did not create new crimes that were not crimes before its effective date, or create new punishment for crimes committed before its effective date, but merely enhanced the punishment for crimes committed after its effective date by reason of previous felony convictions. The court further held that because appellants committed the burglary after the effective date of the Act, and thus were charged with knowledge that they were going to be subject to punishment under the Act for committing the burglary, it was properly applied to them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for capital murder. Prior to trial, he filed a demurrer to the indictment and a motion to quash the indictment. Defendant asserted that the Act had been declared unconstitutional and that an amendment had been sought through a judicial decree to give a constitutionally valid application of the Act to his case. Defendant argued that such an amendment was void. Defendant subsequently entered a guilty plea. A jury later fixed defendant's sentence at life imprisonment without parole. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, subscribing to the opinion that the Act's validity could be salvaged by striking out the unconstitutional provision relating to instructing the jury on lesser-included offenses. The court refused to conclude that defendant had waived his challenge to the Act. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not err in rejecting defendant's assertion that he had an unequal number of strikes in selecting the jury. The court noted that the numerical combination of striking alternatively left the State with 17 strikes and defendant was 16 strikes. This mathematical result accorded with the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed after he was convicted upon retrial. He asserted that his retrial violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, that the trial court had violated the provision against the ex post facto application of laws when it followed newly-enacted procedures in voir dire, that the State should have been required to elect between prosecuting him for murder or robbery, and that a witness's identification was tainted by his illegal arrest. In affirming, the court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause did not apply because defendant's original conviction had not been reversed due to an insufficiency of the evidence. Defendant's motion for a mistrial, asserted after the improper remarks were made, did not invoke double jeopardy protection because the motion had properly been denied. The trial court properly applied new procedural rules enacted after defendant's arrest but before his retrial; ex post facto protection did not apply to procedural rules that did not impair defendant's substantive rights. Murder and robbery were separate offenses that were properly charged in a single indictment and appropriately tried together. The witness's identification was not tainted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After he was convicted of felony murder, defendant was given a separate sentencing hearing before the same jury that found him guilty of the capital offense. The jury weighed the evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and fixed punishment at death. In a second sentencing hearing, the trial court independently weighed the circumstances and also sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed, arguing, among other things, that admission of a fingerprint comparison report was error, his accomplice's sentence, which was not death, should have been admitted in mitigation, and evidence of prior convictions were erroneously admitted in aggravation since they were not convictions when he was tried. The court found the admission of the report was harmless because defendant's presence at the scene was undisputed and uncontradicted. Also, the accomplice's sentence was irrelevant because that sentence was based on the accomplice's circumstances, not defendant's. Finally, because defendant was convicted of other crimes by the time of his sentencing hearing, they were admissible as aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) defendant was not entitled to postpone the probation revocation proceeding until the underlying criminal charges upon which the revocation proceeding was based were resolved because the term of probation that was allegedly violated -- staying out of the department store -- was not conditioned upon the commission of any crime by defendant at the time of her return to the store; and (2) the requirement that defendant stay out of the department store did not unconstitutionally infringe upon her constitutional rights because the requirement was reasonably related to the crime of which defendant was convicted and to future criminality.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, sought review of a judgment of the Tallapoosa Circuit Court (Alabama), which granted the State's motion to transfer defendant from juvenile court to circuit court for prosecution as an adult for the crime of murder. The juvenile court had originally granted the motion. Defendant appealed from that order, and a trial de novo was had in the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 17 years old and married when he was charged with the murder of a 6 year old girl. He subsequently tested to be in the high-average range of intelligence. The victim was found dead on defendant's father's property. Investigators questioned defendant, who was the last person to see the girl alive, and his father, both of whom had signed a waiver of their Miranda rights. At one point, defendant's father stated that if defendant was being accused of anything he wanted an attorney. Investigators assumed him that defendant was not being accused at that time. Defendant was given access to his wife when he asked, but testimony differed as to whether his father was denied access to him when his father requested to see him. Defendant confessed to the murder. The court held that: (1) the confession was voluntarily given after a knowing and intelligent waiver which passed constitutional muster; (2) the search of defendant's home was conducted after voluntary consent was given; and (3) probable cause to believe defendant committed the acts alleged in the transfer petition was provided not only by his confession but by the physical details of the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court did not find that the statute that he was indicted under was unconstitutional. Next, the court did not find any reversible error in the trial court's refusal to give a requested charge on robbery as a separate lesser-included offense. The trial court was correct in pointing out that the robbery and murder were all part of one criminal transaction without any significance intervening time. Also, the court did not find any constitutional violations where the jury had applied the capital murder statute to a non-triggerman in a murder-robbery. The court noted that the evidence was sufficient for supporting a jury finding that defendant possessed the necessary particularized intent to kill, although he did not fire the fatal shots. Finally, the court found the trial court had properly admitted the photographic evidence of the victims' bodies for proving a material issue and for illustrating a relevant fact. The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

As to defendant's allegation of an erroneous jury charge, the court found that the doctrine of constructive possession was adequately and substantially covered in an oral charge and defendant's written charges which were given to the jury.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was given a life sentence for capital murder and the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant defendant's argument that his sentence was unconstitutional. Essentially, defendant claimed that he should have been tried under a portion of the Ala.

The court reasoned that defendant had no right to be tried under said portion because it had previously been declared unconstitutional. The court also rejected defendant's argument that there was no evidence of premeditation or deliberation. The court found that the jury could infer premeditation and deliberation from the wounds inflicted and the fact that there was no argument or altercation taking place at the time of the crime. Finally, the court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court improperly instructed the jury on the defense of insanity. The trial court instructed the jury not to consider the defense.

The jury recommended the death sentence and the trial court, having weighed the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, pursuant to Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-47 (1975), sentenced defendant to death. On appeal, defendant alleged that his demurrer to the indictment should have been granted because it failed to aver the time of the offense and that there was no death penalty during the time the offense occurred. The court found that there was a death penalty during that time and that it was not necessary to state the precise time of the offense. It found that the indictment was clear enough to let defendant know what he was charged with. Defendant also alleged error in the denial of his motion for new trial, based on the non-disclosure of information about a police officer.

A customer then walked into the store, and defendant ran off. Defendant was convicted of robbery in the first degree. A sentencing hearing was conducted after appropriate notice that the State was invoking the provisions of the Habitual Offender Act. At the hearing there was undisputed evidence that defendant had been previously convicted of burglary in more than three separate cases. Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9(c)(3) required that defendant must be sentenced to imprisonment for life without parole. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed and held that (1) there was no error in the judge's charge to the jury; (2) the fact that defendant's seven prior burglary convictions all stemmed from the same drunken incident did not allow them to be counted as only one prior crime rather than seven; (3) mandatory punishment by imprisonment for life without parole under the Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9(c), was not a violation of the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment; and (4) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted defendant of theft of a building, in violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-3 (1975), and sentenced him to three years' imprisonment. Defendant contended that the failure of the trial judge to order the production of the entire diary of a government witness constituted reversible error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district attorney moved to quash the subpoena duces tecum, alleging that the defense was attempting to conduct a &quot;fishing expedition.&quot; The court held the trial court properly read the entire diary in camera and determined that the defendant's request had been &quot;sufficiently particularized&quot; to order the production of two diary entries. Defendant also claimed that because the trial court in the trial of another defendant, separately convicted, did not advise defendant of his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself it was reversible error to introduce his prior testimony. The court disagreed. Defendant was explicitly advised that he had a right to remain silent and that any incriminating statements he did make could place him in jeopardy. He testified voluntarily for the defense and was warned of his right not to incriminate himself. Since the evidence was sufficient to support the inference of a conspiracy, it followed that venue for defendant's trial could be the venue for the other trial. For the jury to determine defendant's true intent regarding the taking of the building, it was permissible and necessary for the state to show parts of the broad, overall picture.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held the trial court's order denying defendant's request for production of the complete diary was proper and within his discretion and that defendant's incriminating testimony on behalf of the defense in a separate trial was admissible. The court held the evidence of conspiracy was properly admitted and affirmed the conviction for theft of a building.</SPAN></P>

After considering two prior convictions, the circuit court set defendant's sentence at 50 years. On appeal, defendant contended that the absence at trial of his 14 year-old companion denied him a fair trial. Defendant also alleged that the circuit court failed to make a required determination of his sanity to stand trial, that he could not be convicted of promoting prostitution when there was no statute prohibiting prostitution itself, and that the State should have given him pretrial notice of the prior convictions it was going to use in invoking the Habitual Offender Act. The court affirmed, holding that defendant could not object to the absence of the witness in the trial because he did not attempt to obtain the presence of the witness. The court held that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in not determining defendant's competency because there was no evidence of incompetency. The court further concluded that there was a statute declaring prostitution a crime, and that defendant was given sufficient notice of the use of his prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 13A-11-8(b)(1)(b) (Supp. 1981), sentenced him to six months' hard labor, and imposed a $ 500 fine.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The telephone company traced hang-up calls to defendant's telephone. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 13A-11-8(b)(1)(b), the city's jurisdiction to prosecute him, the sufficiency of the circumstantial evidence, and expert testimony given by telephone company employees about the tracing procedures and equipment. He claimed that the jury was improperly influenced by extraneous materials in the jury room and that his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that &sect; 13A-11-8(b)(1)(b) constitutionally proscribed the use of a telephone to harass or alarm when there was no legitimate purpose for the communication and was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court concluded that the city properly prosecuted the offense because the calls were received within its police jurisdiction, Ala. Code &sect; 12-14-1(b) (1975). It affirmed the sentence under Ala. Code &sect; 11-45-9 (1975) because the penalty for violation of a municipal ordinance and a state statute that proscribed the same act did not have to be the same and Mountain Brook, Ala., Ordinance 796 only adopted the state's codified misdemeanors, not its punishments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for the murders of two grocery store employees. After he invoked his right to counsel, but before counsel was provided, defendant made incriminating statements during conversations with two detectives. The statements were admitted into evidence at trial. On appeal, defendant claimed that the statements were the product of an interrogation and that the interrogation was improper because he had invoked his right to counsel. Defendant thus contended that the trial court erred in admitting the statements into evidence. The court affirmed. The court determined that the statements were not the product of an interrogation, but rather were volunteered by defendant, and, therefore, that the trial court did not err in admitting them into evidence. The court noted that the comments the detectives made during the conversations were not reasonably likely to elicit any incriminating statements and, therefore, that the conversations did not amount to an interrogation of defendant. Further, the court rejected defendant's contention that the detectives engaged in a scheme that was designed to elicit an incriminating statement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the jury should have returned a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A deputy sheriff testified that he witnessed defendant, whom he knew as a former inmate, kill the sheriff with a pistol. Defendant claimed that he was not guilty by reason of insanity. A jury convicted defendant of the murder and fixed the punishment as death. The court affirmed, holding that the evidence of defendant's insanity was not both overwhelming and uncontradicted where there was evidence that supported a reasonable inference that the homicide was committed by a man who the law defined as sane. The evidence did not overcome the presumption of sanity. Although the pretrial publicity was great, defendant did not demonstrate the actual existence of a prejudicial opinion in the minds of the jurors that raised a presumption of partiality to support his motion for a change of venue. Defendant had no constitutional right to the appointment of a psychiatrist of his own choosing at public expense. By actively pursuing an insanity defense and introducing the deposition of a psychiatrist as a defense witness, defendant waived any potential psychotherapist-patient privilege or privilege against self-incrimination against the testimony of a psychiatrist who examined defendant.</SPAN></P>

The police searched the car, which was under defendant's control, and discovered marijuana in the trunk. Defendant was indicted for trafficking in cannabis. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the marijuana seized from his car, and defendant was convicted of the charged offense. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly admitted testimony of the informant's conversations with the trafficker because the evidence was such that it could have reasonably been found that a conspiracy existed between defendant and the trafficker.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery in the first degree and was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole under the Alabama Habitual Felony Offender Act, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-41 (1977). On appeal, defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict of robbery in the first degree because the State did not prove that the pistol used by defendant was loaded. Defendant also alleged that the circuit court judge erred in not charging the jury on the lesser offenses of robbery in the second and third degrees. The court affirmed, holding that under the statutory presumption created by Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-41(b), the use of a firearm was prima facie evidence of the use of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument, and that the State was not required to prove that the weapon was loaded. The court further concluded that the sentence of life without parole imposed on defendant under the Alabama Habitual Felony Offender Statute did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and that there was no merit to defendant's argument that the circuit court judge failed to determine the nature of one of the prior offenses in sentencing defendant as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the argument and affirmed the judgment. Although seeds and branches were weighed with the plant material, the court concluded that defendant did not sufficiently establish that the portions of the cannabis seized were within the exclusions of &sect; 20-2-2(15). Defendant did not meet his burden of establishing that the seeds were sterilized. Further the court determined that it was proper for the state to include the branches found in the cannabis for weighing purposes because they were not excluded under &sect; 20-2-2(15). The court rejected defendant's contention that &sect; 20-2-80(1) was unconstitutionally vague or indefinite as to its sentencing scheme. Finally, the court held that the warrant for the search of defendant's residence was properly executed and that the affidavit, which was based upon the hearsay information of a confidential informant, satisfied the positive averment requirement of Ala.

Defendant also fired with one of the shots killing the decedent. Defendant was indicted for murder and convicted of second-degree manslaughter. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in not giving a self-defense instruction. The court found that whether defendant went willingly to fight the decedent was a matter clearly within the province of the jury and the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's conclusion. The court found that defendant's requested charge did not state a correct proposition of law and it was properly refused. Defendant also argued denial of due process and denial of equal protection due to the refusal of the trial court to permit him to confer with his counsel during a brief recess in the midst of defendant's testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant prescribed amphetamines to one of his employees allegedly to keep him alert on a long drive, and he was convicted of violating &sect; 20-2-70(a). Defendant claimed that as a licensed physician, he could not be prosecuted under &sect; 20-2-70(a). The court found a doctor could be guilty of &sect; 20-2-70(a) if he wrote a prescription for a controlled substance for no legitimate medical purpose or for an amount not reasonably related to the proper medical management of his patient's illnesses or conditions. In those situations, a doctor was unauthorized to write such prescriptions under Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-51(b) (1975), which concerned physician registration. Ala. Code &sect; 20-2-70(a) was not unconstitutional because the language of the statute was not vague, ambiguous, or indefinite and it identified a standard by which a licensed physician might determine whether or not his conduct was proscribed by the statute. Because the employee had worn a wire to tape his conversations with defendant about the prescription, the taping did not constitute an illegal search. The tape recordings were properly admitted. A proper foundation was laid for admission of information from a learned treatise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case arose out of the attempted bombing of a church. Defendant first contended that the statute of limitations barred his prosecution and conviction. He claimed that, because of a recent decision in another case, his felony was no longer a capital offense and thus carried a three-year statute of limitations as of the date of that decision. He also filed a motion to quash the indictment alleging a due process violation resulting from the long delay between the commission of the crime and his indictment. He specifically alleged that, because of the death of certain witnesses along with the loss of certain records and dimming of memories, he was denied a fair trial in violation of the due process clause. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that defendant's prosecution was not barred by the statute of limitations because the trial court properly applied the statute of limitations in effect at the time of the crime and not the statute of limitations in effect at the time of the indictment. Defendant failed to meet the heavy burden of proof of showing an actual and substantial prejudice resulting from the lengthy delay.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the transcription of testimony of a witness from a previous hearing was erroneously admitted into evidence at his preliminary hearing. The court found that defendant had requested a preliminary hearing after the time limit proscribed by Ala. Code &sect; 15-11-1 (1975), and noted that such a hearing was not required at law. Although defendant asserted that he was too young to have been tried as an adult under &sect; 13A-5-31(a)(3), the court declared that the statute defined the aggravating sexual offense without reference to the defendant's age. Alabama specifically enumerated capital offenses and the court noted that the state did not protect juveniles where capital murder was involved. Finally, the court held that the circumstantial evidence presented was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction as the circumstances presented were consistent with the hypothesis of guilt and inconsistent with all other rational hypotheses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Jefferson Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted him of a capital offense of nighttime burglary during the course of which the victim was intentionally killed, a violation of Ala. Code &sect; 13-11-2(a)(4) (1975), and sentencing him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant maintained that curative procedural changes the Alabama Supreme Court made with respect to the method of sentencing one convicted of a capital offense constituted an unconstitutional usurpation of legislative authority and violated the doctrine of separation of powers guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. The court, relying on precedent from the Alabama Supreme Court, found that the legislature's authority had not been usurped with respect to the changes made to the method of sentencing capital offenders because the changes were procedural. Further, defendant, who was indigent, had no constitutional right to the appointment of a psychiatrist or other expert at state expense. Defendant had been examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist at his request to determine whether a more extensive mental examination or the instigation of procedures under Ala. Code &sect; 15-16-22 (1975) was necessary and that the psychiatrist found no evidence of psychosis or satisfy the criteria for involuntary commitment. Failure to grant a continuance of the sentencing hearing to allow defendant to have a mental exam did not constitute error.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that, while defendant presented a defense that might have justified his conduct with reference to the structure, there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict. Defendant filed a demurrer to the indictment, claiming that it failed to specify the date of the alleged offense and that the statute which he allegedly violated, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-3 (1975), was unconstitutional because it was vague, uncertain, indefinite, and overbroad. In spite of defendant's technical arguments to the contrary, the court found that the indictment was couched in language so clear that any person of common understanding would know that he was charged with violating the new theft statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-13 (1975).

The court further held that the ordinance was not in conflict with Ala. Code &sect; 13A-11-10 (1975), although the statute required more than mere public intoxication.

A security employee saw defendant go into a dressing room with four items and then leave the room with only two items visible. Defendant went to a sales counter, saw the security employee, returned to the dressing room, entered a stall, and closed the door. The security employee and a store security manager confronted defendant, and the security manager saw two items as they were thrown over to another stall. Defendant stated that she returned to the dressing room with the items to try them on again. The court found that the State's evidence was sufficient to submit to the jury and that it was sufficient to sustain the jury's verdict. The property in question exceeded $ 25 in value and was taken by defendant in a building where the property was to have been sold. Thus, the requirements under &sect; 13A-8-4(e) were met by the State's evidence. Defendant's actions constituted &quot;theft of property&quot; as defined in Ala. Code &sect; 13A-8-2(1) (Supp. 1977).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which convicted defendant of rape and sentenced defendant as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant testified that he had no contact whatsoever with the victim on the night of the assault. The trial court allowed two other women to testify that defendant had raped them in a similar manner. The court found no error, holding that unique similarities in the manner of committing the crime justified the admission of the evidence concerning the two collateral offenses. As to evidence concerning another prior alleged rape for which defendant was acquitted, the court found that defendant first mentioned the incident in an unresponsive answer to a question on cross-examination. Defendant failed to preserve for appeal the issue of whether there was proper proof that he had been convicted of three prior felonies. The court further found that the rape statute,&nbsp;Ala. Code &sect; 13A-6-61 (1975), was not unconstitutional on equal protection grounds. Although males were punished more severely than females for sexual offenses, the court concluded that such punishment was reasonably designed to deter and control a specific and serious problem of legitimate concern to the citizens of the state.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that: (1) defendant was not unconstitutionally denied a speedy trial because there was no positive proof that he ever asserted his speedy trial right prior to the motion to dismiss and there was no specific showing that he was prejudiced by the delay; (2) defendant never activated the 180-day period under art. III(a), Interstate Agreement on Detainers because he failed to properly notify Alabama officials and to have the certificate of inmate status sent to them; and (3) defendant was not entitled to a pre-transfer hearing because the United States had not adopted the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act and did not statutorily provide a federal prisoner with any procedural protections when being transferred to state custody.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the 1980 amendments to Ala.

Defendant also argued that there was no probable cause to issue the search warrant, and that the drug paraphernalia that was introduced into evidence was inadmissible because the items were irrelevant. The court concluded that: (1) the 1980 amendment to &sect; 12-17-251(c)(1) was a general act of statewide application; (2) probable cause for the search warrant was clearly established; (3) the drug paraphernalia was relevant as circumstantial evidence illustrating knowing possession of marijuana by defendant; and (4) the actual sentence to be served by defendant provided him no standing to raise an issue of the constitutionality of a potential maximum sentence which was not imposed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the trial court committed error when it allowed the State's exhibit into evidence, and considered it as a prior conviction of defendant of a felony. The court however concluded that the exhibit was not prejudicial but noted that the proper way to prove a prior felony conviction was by introducing a certified copy of the minute entry, showing a valid prior conviction of defendant of a felony, or by the admission of defendant. The court held that defendant's sentence for 10 years was within the limits prescribed and that the applicable &sect; 13A-5-9 was previously held to be constitutional, and did not violate the Due Process, or Ex Post Facto Clauses of the constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The indictment charged defendant within intentionally causing the death of another person by shooting him with a pistol. At trial defendant testified that he saw the victim coming at him and threatening him and he became scared, stumbled, lost his balance, and fired the pistol. The jury found defendant guilty of manslaughter. Defendant appealed his conviction arguing that &sect; 13A-2-2(3), defining &quot;recklessly&quot; was unconstitutionally vague and uncertain and that the jury was therefore deprived of considering the lesser crime of criminally negligent homicide. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the undisputed evidence showed that the victim was killed by a bullet from defendant's pistol that was in defendant's hand and that defendant had his middle finger on the trigger. The victim and defendant were facing each other, and the bullet penetrated the front of the victim's head. The court concluded that because the jury was properly instructed on the definition of recklessly, there was ample evidence in the record to establish defendant's conduct and the jury was not deprived of considering whether defendant's conduct was only criminally negligent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court, which convicted defendant after the jury found him guilty of manslaughter for the shooting death of the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction, after trial by jury in the Morgan Circuit Court (Alabama), for the crime of escape in the first degree as proscribed Ala. Code &sect; 13A-10-31(a)(2)(b). He argued that the trial court erred by denying his motions for a continuance and for new trial. He also appealed from his sentence to life imprisonment, which was imposed under the Alabama Habitual Felony Offenders Act, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9(c)(2) (Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant escaped from a county jail. The State's main witness was the jailer, who testified that defendant overcame him and escaped. Defense counsel was not appointed until two days before trial. He moved for a continuance, seeking more time to prepare. The State contested the motion, arguing that more time was not needed because there were only two witnesses, one of whom had traveled out of state. The trial court denied counsel's motion. The trial court also denied counsel's motion for a new trial based on the denial of his earlier motion. On appeal, the court held that to justify reversal of defendant's conviction, the court had to determine whether counsel would have been in any better position than he was at the time of trial if the motion had been granted. The court found that the record failed to show that defendant was not afforded adequate representation at trial. The court ruled that the trial court, in ruling on defendant's motion for new trial, was in a better position to weigh the amount of time counsel had to prepare and that it did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. The court also ruled that the Act was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for possessing marijuana in the Mobile Circuit Court (Alabama). Defendant's motion for a new trial, raising the sufficiency of the evidence and claiming that the trial court erred in refusing several written charges, was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Approximately 24.9 pounds of marijuana was found in defendant's residence, along with three handguns and currency. When the officers found white powder and brought it to where defendant was sitting, defendant said that he knew about the weed but he did not know that the white powder was in his house. Defendant made the statement without any questions being asked him by the officers. Defendant's motion to suppress the evidence was denied. The court held that: (1) the search warrant's supporting affidavit and testimony established probable cause and defendant failed to show that a false statement was knowingly and intentionally made or was made with reckless disregard for the truth in order to support issuance of the warrant; (2) other items found during the search were part of the res gestae and had probative value to establish that possession of the marijuana was not for personal use; (3) even if defendant did not understand the Miranda warnings, the spontaneous utterance with reference to the white powder was admissible into evidence; and (4) defendant's attacks on the constitutionality of Ala. Code 20-2-1 et seq., which prohibited the possession of marijuana, were meritless.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the conviction and alleged that the city's traffic code, which required a permit for a parade of public demonstration, constituted an impermissible prior restraint of speech or assembly as guaranteed by the United States Constitution. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the relevant sections of the city's traffic code were not so overbroad as to cause an impermissible prior restraint on First Amendment expression, and that the permit provisions of the code were sufficiently bounded by precise and clear standards, which were narrowly tailored to further the city's legitimate interest. The relevant provisions of the code were constitutional as applied because based on the concerns and responsibilities of the city in preparing for a parade, the nine-day period between the filing of a parade application and the parading was not so unreasonable as to constitute an illegal prior restraint on free speech. The case was remanded for a determination of the proper fine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted for selling pentazocine, also known as Talwin, and filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus. The trial court issued a writ vacating the conviction and ordering the fine and court costs be repaid to petitioner. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, and reversed and remanded in part. The court stated the highest state appellate court held pentazocine was not properly classified as a controlled substance and could not be the basis for a criminal charge. The court stated courts would take judicial notice of law, therefore no parol testimony was necessary to show invalidity of the judgment and a writ of habeas corpus was an available remedy. The court further held, however, the order for repayment against the State was violative of Ala. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 (1901). The court stated the only relief available was a &quot;relief bill&quot; by the legislature or a claim filed with a state board of adjustment per Ala. Code &sect; 41-9-60 (1975).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A car owner left his car parked with the keys inside. Later, the car was reported to the police as missing. Several witnesses gave testimony that they saw defendant driving the car. The car was found wrecked and abandoned. Defendant was charged and found guilty of receiving stolen property in the first degree. Defendant appealed on several grounds, including that the jury should have received a charge of the lesser included offense of unauthorized use of a vehicle, that the admission into evidence of the investigator's testimony was error, and that the Alabama Habitual Felony Offenders Act, Ala. Code &sect; 13A-5-9 (1975), was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the conviction because even though a habitual offender criminal charge did not state a separate offense, the determination of whether one was a habitual offender was essentially independent of the underlying substantive offense. Furthermore, the court ruled that the admission in evidence of the testimony of the investigator as to a statement made to the investigator by defendant was proper because the statement's trustworthiness satisfied legal requirements and was shown to be free from coercive or involuntary influence.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 20-2-1 et seq. (1975).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of 125 tablets containing pentazocine (Talwin). He appealed, and the court affirmed. Defendant contended that at the time of his arrest Talwin had not been legally classified as a controlled substance in Alabama pursuant to Ala. Code &sect;&sect; 20-2-20(a) and (b). The court held that Talwin was designated a controlled substance by the Federal Government, and consequently, &sect;&sect; 20-2-20(a) and (b) did not govern. Ala Code &sect; 20-2-20(d) provided that substances controlled under Federal law would automatically be controlled under Alabama law, unless the Board of Health objected. The court held that the Board of Health made no objection to the federal designation of Talwin tablets as a Schedule IV controlled substance, and, therefore, thirty days from publication in the Federal Register of the final order designating Talwin tablets as a Schedule IV substance, Talwin tablets became a Schedule IV controlled substance in Alabama. The court held further that &sect; 20-2-20(d) did not violate defendant's constitutional right of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, wife and husband, appealed their judgments of conviction from the Montgomery Circuit Court (Alabama), which sentenced defendant wife to a total of 35 years and defendant husband to a total of 115 years after finding them guilty of possession of marijuana and child molestation under the Alabama Child Pornography Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon a tip from a first time informer, a police officer set up a controlled buy of marijuana using the informant and, having verified the reliability and credibility of the informer, personally appeared before the magistrate for a search warrant. Finding the officer's affidavit sufficient, the magistrate issued a warrant. Upon the warrant's execution, the police found marijuana as well as pornographic photographs of defendants' own children and other children. After a non-jury trial, the court found both defendants guilty of marijuana possession and violation of the Alabama Child Pornography Act (Act), Ala. Code &sect; 13-7-237 (1975). On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court properly refused to require disclosure of the confidential informant's identity where informant merely supplied information to the police officer to establish probable cause for search of defendants' residence for drugs. Further, because the photographs were found in a box where marijuana could have been hidden during the execution of a valid warrant, they were properly admitted into evidence. Last, the court rejected the defendants' argument that the Act was ambiguous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of receiving stolen property and sentenced defendant to prison for 20 years per the Alabama Habitual Felony Offenders Act. The State presented evidence that the stolen pistol had been purchased from defendant, nothing more. The court affirmed. The court held that the fact that the pistol had been purchased from defendant, nothing more, was sufficient to send the matter to the jury. When defendant objected that he had been sentenced per the habitual felony offenders act grounded upon two prior felonies where he was not represented by an attorney, the court held that although Gideon established the rule that the right to counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment was applicable to the states by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment, making it unconstitutional to try a person for a felony in a state court unless he had a lawyer or had validly waived one, the transcript affirmatively showed by the record in each of his two prior felony convictions that defendant formally and fully, intelligently and understandingly, waived his right to counsel. The court concluded that the habitual offender act was not an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after he obtained roofing materials by false pretenses. Defendant argued that the one-for-one jury strike procedure used in the county when coupled with the Alabama Habitual Offender Statute,&nbsp;Ala.

Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in overruling defense counsel's objections to statements made by the district attorney in closing argument that the burden of proof rested on defendant. The court concluded that: (1) even if defendant had standing, he produced no evidence that the convictions were more easily obtained in the county because of the one-for-one jury strike system than in other counties of the state following the two-for-one strike procedure; (2) the trial judge properly and correctly instructed the jury on the burden of proof, the presumption of innocence, and the principles of reasonable doubt; and (3) while the prosecutor's remarks and the failure of the trial judge to sustain the objections of defense counsel ventured very near the area of reversible error, in view of the judge's comments and his instructions to the jury, there was no reversible error.</SPAN></P>
