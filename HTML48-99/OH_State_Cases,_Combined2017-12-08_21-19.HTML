</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The assessment related to six auction sales of heavy construction equipment in a two-year period. The court found that the auctioneer effected a transfer of title or possession, or both, of tangible personal property and was a vendor within the meaning of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.01(C) even though the auctioneer did not actually transfer title to or possession of that property. The auctioneer argued that the sales of items in one particular sale had been determined to be a casual sale in a previous case and that the nature of the sale did not change because the Commissioner was trying to tax the agent of the seller rather than the purchaser. The court agreed and modified the Commissioner's ruling to reflect that the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals was res judicata as to those particular items because the auctioneer was in privity with the purchaser as to the items. The court found, however, that the decision did not extend to other items sold at that particular sale where other parties were involved and, therefore, the principal of res judicata or collateral estoppel was not applicable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant driver sought review of a decision from the Franklin County Municipal Court (Ohio), which affirmed a referee's decision that there was no error on the part of the bureau of motor vehicles in suspending the driver's license. The driver had alleged that the suspension was improper in that the state had not fully complied with the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in finding that he had refused to take the required chemical alcohol test where he had requested and was denied the right to consult an attorney before submitting to such chemical test as required by Ohio Rev. Stat. &sect; 4511.191.The court found that, in this case, the officers involved had violated the driver's right to forthwith contact an attorney. The court found that, as the record indicated, repeated requests to contact an attorney were ignored. The court held that the pertinent issue in this case, however, was whether there was a necessity that a suspect indicate a willingness to take the test prior to his contacting an attorney, in order to avoid the consequences of a suspension of his license for the refusal to take the test. The court held that a refusal conditioned upon a timely and bonafide request to contact an attorney did not constitute a refusal contemplated by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19. Accordingly, the court held that the decision of the trial court, in holding that the driver's act constituted a refusal, was erroneous.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the municipal court and remanded the cause. The court sustained the first assignment of error regarding whether the driver's act constituted a refusal. The court overruled the remaining assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The dentist brought an injunction action against the State, the auditor, and the state agency to compel payment for dental services provided to welfare patients pursuant to a contract with the State. The auditor brought an action for a writ of prohibition to prevent the common pleas court from hearing the case. The court issued a limited writ that solely prohibited the action against the State. The common pleas court was not prohibited from hearing the action against the auditor and the state agency. In waiving the State's immunity from liability, the general assembly limited jurisdiction in such matters to the state court of claims. However, an action against a public officer to compel him to perform a public duty was not an action against the State such that it would be precluded by sovereign immunity. Although a direct action on a contract with the State, seeking monetary relief from the State, needed to be brought in the court of claims and could not be brought in the common pleas court, an action for injunctive relief against a state officer, even though it involved a state contract, could be brought in such a court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his convictions from the Court of Common Pleas of Medina County (Ohio) for two counts of selling a hallucinogen, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.44(D).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted on two counts of the sale of a hallucinogen as a result of undercover activity. Defendant was convicted as charged. He appealed. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 3719.44(D) was not unconstitutional with respect to the substance commonly known as marijuana. The court reasoned that defendant's botanical argument asserting that &sect; 3719.44(D) only covered particular types of cannabis had been previously rejected. The court also found no inconsistency between &sect; 3719.44 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.32, which related to the sale of poisons, even though the statutes proscribed different penalties. The court concluded that the trial court did not violate Ohio R. Crim. P. 29(A) in denying defendant's motion for acquittal at the close of the State's case. Further, the trial court essentially overruled defendant's motion for acquittal made at the close of his case by taking the matter under advisement after all of the evidence had been introduced. Finally, the court held that there was more than ample evidence for the trial court to find defendant guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant school bus drivers challenged the judgment of the Hamilton County Common Pleas Court (Ohio), which affirmed the action taken by appellee, a board of education, which board had found the drivers to be on strike from their school employment and, as such, in violation of the Ferguson Act as found within Ohio Rev. Code Ann. tit. 41.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The drivers were employed by the school board as school bus drivers. They attempted to obtain recognition by the board of a public school employees' union as their representative for bargaining purposes, but the board refused to recognize the bargaining agent. The drivers refused to report for work on a certain date, and engaged in picketing and other related activities at a number of the school buildings of the school district. The board sent them notice pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4117.04 and held a hearing in which the board determined that they were on strike and were in violation of the Ferguson Act. The trial court affirmed the decision, and the drivers appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. There was no due process violation in the board's notice to the drivers or in the board's hearing process. The drivers' demand for recognition of a bargaining agent did constitute a strike within the meaning of the Ferguson Act. The Ohio Supreme Court recognized the Ferguson Act prohibited strikes by public employees and found that the procedures did not violate due process of law or any other constitutional protection and the court was bound by such determinations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the order of the Hamilton County Municipal Court (Ohio), which following a bench trial, convicted him of failure to comply with orders issued by the Director of Buildings and Inspections of the City of Cincinnati pursuant to certain sections of the city building code.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Building inspectors repeatedly cited defendant for building code violations. Defendant only made a few of the ordered corrections. One of the inspectors swore out a complaint. On the day of the trial, defendant appeared pro se and requested a continuance so that he could prove he was not the building owner. The trial court denied the continuance and convicted defendant. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. While there was no direct testimony that defendant had been served with the inspectors' orders, he admitted he had discussed the orders with the inspectors and he had not denied the inspector's statement that he had promised to remedy the premises. Even if the complaint was defective, under Ohio R. Crim. P. 12(B)(2) defendant's failure to timely object had waived the issue. The prosecution had proved every necessary element because defendant had not denied there was no compliance with the orders. The mortgage defendant attempted to introduce was dated long after the offense. Defendant failed to produce the land contract he claimed exculpated him, although he had ample time to do so and knew of its significance to his case. Therefore, he was not entitled to a continuance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the affidavit that charged defendant with a violation of &sect; 3719.172(A), the word &quot;hypo&quot; was used instead of the word hypodermic. The court affirmed the municipal court's judgment. The word &quot;hypo&quot; was sufficient to put defendant on notice of the offense that was charged when the affidavit also provided the essential facts that constituted the offense and the statutory designation. The prosecution was not required to prove that a subcutaneous injection of medication could have been accomplished with the instrument in question because that was not an element of the prosecution's case. Section 3719.172 was not so vague, imprecise, and indefinite that persons of ordinary intelligence must have guessed at its meaning. It was sufficiently clear to indicate the proscribed conduct. The trial court did not improperly refuse to continue defendant's bond in order to allow time for filing a new trial because Ohio R. Crim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff passenger appealed an order from the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which granted the summary judgment motions of defendants, an automobile owner and a driver, on the passenger's claims for injuries sustained in a one-car accident. Defendants' summary judgment motion was based on the Ohio Guest Statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4515.02.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver operated the owner's automobile while the passenger rode. The passenger and defendants were domiciled in Ohio and the automobile was purchased and registered in Ohio. The accident occurred in Kentucky, which had no guest statute. Although the trial court initially denied defendant's motion for summary judgment, another trial judge granted defendants' motion. On appeal, the passenger relied on the doctrine of lex loci delicti and asserted that the substantive law of Kentucky applied. The court reviewed Ohio jurisprudence that addressed the choice of law issue and held that the Ohio Supreme Court receded from the strict application of lex loci delicti. The court applied the governmental interest test and held that the Ohio substantive law applied, which included the passenger's right to recovery from defendants, and that Kentucky's traffic regulations applied. The trial court properly applied Ohio's Guest Statute. The passenger's challenge to the Guest Statute's constitutionality was properly preserved because it was raised on oral argument in opposition to defendants' second motion. The Guest Statute's constitutionality was established by prior jurisprudence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment award to defendants on the passenger's personal injury claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant former wife appealed a judgment of an Ohio trial court, which found that the obligation of plaintiff former husband to support the youngest child had terminated at majority, pursuant to an amendment to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.01. Therefore, the husband was not in contempt for failing to obey a support order. The wife's action for a declaratory judgment on the separation agreement was consolidated with the motion for contempt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The final judgment of divorce incorporated the parties' separation agreement, in which the husband had agreed to support the children until each became emancipated. The husband quit paying support for the youngest child when he reached 18 years of age and graduated from high school because of an amendment to &sect; 3109.01 that reduced majority to 18 years. On appeal, the wife alleged that the trial court's judgment was contrary to law and that the judgment was an unconstitutional interpretation of &sect; 3109.01. The court overruled the assignments of error, finding that the wife's constitutional rights were not violated by the interpretation. Once the agreement was incorporated into the decree, the trial court enforced the decree and not the agreement. The reduction in the age of majority was not the type of ex post facto action in which Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28 was designed to prevent. There was no vested property right in the personal privileges of infancy. By reducing the age of majority, the legislature unequivocally changed the conditions of the child support obligation, and thus the obligation became subject to review by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's judgment of affirmance of the decision of the board was based on a transcript of all the original papers, testimony and evidence offered, heard and taken into consideration in issuing the order appealed from.

The trial court's affirmance was based upon a transcript containing no sworn testimony in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03(c). Further, the court ruled that in an appeal from a ruling of an administrative board, a trial court could not base its affirmance solely upon the transcript of the proceedings before the board, where that transcript did not contain reliable and probative evidence to support the board's ruling. The court rejected the landowner's argument that the board's refusal to grant the permit created an undue hardship and that the denial of the permit was unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious and was contrary to the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the property owner argued that (1) the trial court's decision was contrary to law; (2) Oxford, Ohio, Zoning Ordinance &sect; 82-20(b)(10) was unconstitutional because it was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious; and (3) the decision of the city zoning board was unconstitutional and arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. Upon review, the court found the property owner's arguments without merit. The denial of the zoning variance by the board was not an unreasonable use of the police powers by such body. There was evidence that the variance was sought for the economic advantage of the property owner rather than for any undue hardship. The record further indicated that there was no total deprivation of signs in the city and in that locality but rather a limitation and control over the use of the signs that tended to be uniformly applied without discrimination. There was evidence before the trial court that the intersection was busy and travelled by school children. Upon the ground of traffic safety alone the decision below was justified. The property owner failed to show that he suffered any undue hardship due to the denial of the variance requested.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that &sect; 9-108.1 was unconstitutionally void for vagueness because it failed to clearly express what the ordinary person could intelligently choose, in advance, what course was lawful for him to pursue.

The school board moved for summary judgment, which was granted based upon the doctrine of governmental immunity. The student appealed claiming that the governmental immunity doctrine no longer operated to bar a suit against the school board and that application of a theory of governmental immunity to the school board unconstitutionally discriminated against him as a victim of a governmental act of negligence in violation of his constitutional right to equal protection. The court affirmed and ruled that summary judgment in favor of the school board was appropriate because the school board was not liable for actions in tort pursuant to the doctrine of sovereign immunity in the absence of legislation creating such liability.

The student brought a complaint against the board and sought an injunction against the board from maintaining its discriminatory, abusive, and unconstitutional treatment of the student in suspending him without notice and a hearing, and to order the board to reinstate the student. The trial court dismissed the student's complaint. On review, the court held that because the complaint failed to allege that the board did not afford the student a hearing, the procedural due process issue did not come into play. The court reasoned that although the United States Supreme Court had found Ohio Rev.

The student had failed to request amendment of his complaint prior to the trial court's dismissal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the penalty provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.99(D) were, on their face, unconstitutional. Defendant pointed out that the Ohio Legislature had revised many criminal statutes and penalties in Ohio; therefore, the legislature revised, by implication, the drug statutes. The trial court convicted defendant of possession of heroin for sale and sentenced defendant from 10 to 20 years in prison. On review, the court held that the legislature indicated that it wished to treat violators of these sections differently from those convicted of violating other criminal sections of the Ohio Revised Code Annotated in not revising the penalty provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 3719. The legislature had made the determination that drug related offenses were of great concern to society and that severe penalties were required to help rid society of one of its most debilitating problems. The court concluded that defendant failed to demonstrate that &sect; 3719.99(D) was applied in such a manner so as to deprive him of equal protection under the law. There was no showing that defendant was treated differently than all other persons similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County (Ohio), which convicted him of possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.56, based on evidence that he admitted that he had given his girlfriend a revolver for her protection and his girlfriend's testimony that confirmed what he had admitted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that his prior conviction was not properly proven when the trial court allowed oral testimony in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.75(B); that the prior felony that was used to support his conviction was invalid, because the State failed to prove that he was represented by counsel; that he was deprived of a speedy trial under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2945.71-.73; and the State failed to prove the precise date that was stated in the indictment. Defendant also claimed that he was not given proper credit for the time he remained in jail and the punishment was cruel and unusual. The court held that the oral testimony was sufficient to prove his prior felony conviction under Ohio R. Civ. P. 44(C) and that there was evidence in the prior proceeding that defendant was represented by an attorney. The court determined that defendant was not deprived of a speedy trial, since the period of his continuance was excluded, and that the State was not required to prove the exact date stated in the indictment. The court also held that the punishment was proportionate to the crime and it was not cruel and unusual.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in so far as defendant's conviction was concerned, but remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing to give defendant credit for the time that he served while in jail.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the restriction was not unreasonable as to the locus as the developer failed to show (1) that the locus was unsuitable for Residence &quot;A&quot; zoning because of its contiguity to undesirable or incompatible uses as the area was still being used for residential purposes; (2) that the locus was physically unsuitable for Residence &quot;A&quot; zoning as neither spatial nor topographical problems prevented the developer from putting the locus to Residence &quot;A&quot; use; or (3) that the locus was unsuited for Residence &quot;A&quot; zoning because it did not properly implement the comprehensive plan for the general area as the expectations of adjacent property owners would be thwarted if the locus was permitted to be used for other than Residence &quot;A&quot; zoning.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court determined that the action of the trial court in setting the cases for trial after 45 days following defendant's arrest was reasonable due to the crowded condition of the court's docket. Defendant showed no prejudice because of such delay. When defendant filed his motion for discharge he could have requested a hearing for the purpose of furnishing evidence that there was no crowded docket or any other valid reason for the continuance granted by the trial court, but he did not.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment by the trial court (Ohio) convicting him of violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.35 by knowingly offering to sell or give away and having in his possession and under his control obscene, lewd or lascivious motion picture films.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence as untimely without inquiring into the reason for the delay. The court found that this denial was arbitrary and not in the interest of justice. This error was cured, however, because the trial court did hear the evidence on behalf of the State as to the circumstances surrounding the search and seizure and did interrupt the proceedings when the exhibits were offered into evidence in order to hear defendant's version of same before ruling as to the admissibility thereof. The court did, therefore, consider the substance of the objections raised by defendant's motion to suppress and did, therefore, in effect rule on said the motion by admitting the evidence. The error was, therefore, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As there was no probable cause for the search that produced the film in question without a warrant, the State claimed that co-defendant consented to the search of his car and the seizure of his property. The court found that it was an error for the trial court to believe the office that co-defendant consented to the search of the trunk in light of the contradictory testimony offered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the trial court was reversed, and final judgment was entered herein for defendant.</SPAN></P>

She appealed the suspension before the municipal court, and it affirmed the suspension. On appeal, the court first held that appellant's refusal was knowingly made within the meaning of &sect; 4511.191 even though it was predicated upon the advice of counsel. Next, the court found that the requirement of a Breathalyzer test, as provided in &sect; 4511.191, did not violate the privilege against self-incrimination because the privilege was applicable only to a disclosure by a written or oral utterance. Finally, the court did not find any constitutional violation as to the assistance of counsel. The court held that a Breathalyzer test was not such a critical stage as to require the effective assistance of counsel. The court affirmed the municipal court's judgment as rendered.</SPAN></P>

The municipal court ruled that the driver's license suspension statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191, was constitutional. On appeal, the court did not find any merit in the argument that &sect; 4511.191 provides for a deprivation of property prior to a notice and a hearing. The court noted that under &sect; 4511.191 there was to be a hearing and a determination before the license was actually suspended. The court further noted that the licensee's license was not now under suspension, nor could it be under suspension until all of the appellate procedures had been exhausted.

The court also held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 733.35 permitted the township trustees to meet and deliberate privately because the decision-making process was a judicial type function.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the utility attempted to appropriate the land of appellee property owners to use in the construction of its proposed transmission lines, the city and the department initiated an action against the utility seeking to prevent it from constructing the portion of the line that was to have traversed a proposed park location. The trial court dismissed the utility's appropriation action, and it granted the injunction sought by the city and the department. In affirming the order of the trial court enjoining the construction of the utility's line, the court held that it would not disturb the trial court's factual conclusion that the effects of power conduits such as the utility's line were antagonistic to park purposes. The court did, however, sustain the utility's first assignment of error regarding the appropriation matter because it found that the utility's decision to appropriate the property owner's land was not an abuse of discretion or made in bad faith.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board rezoned the landowners' property from a B-1 business zone to a single family zone, R-4. The lower court found that the landowners overcame the presumption that the zoning resolution bore a substantial relation to the health, safety, and morals of the community and was valid and constitutional. The Board appealed. The court reversed, finding that the landowners by their evidence failed to establish either that the resolution as applied to their land did not bear a reasonable relationship to the legitimate exercise of police power or that the resolution zoning their land as R-4, residential was so arbitrary, confiscatory, or unreasonable as to be in violation of the Constitution. There was no evidence to show that a substantial portion of the land rezoned from a business use to a residential use was used for a business use. Also, the nonconforming business uses shown by the evidence were in the process of development for residential uses. The holding of the lower court that the zoning of the land in question was unconstitutional had the undesirable effect of leaving the land unzoned. Such a result was incompatible with the object of the comprehensive plan of the county.</SPAN></P>

The board approved the recommendation based upon a finding of gross inefficiency in the performance of the teacher's duties, willful and persistent violations of the board's regulations, and other good and just cause. The teacher filed an action for administrative review of the board's decision. The trial court affirmed the termination. The teacher claimed on appeal that the judgment was not sustained by the evidence, that it was contrary to law, and that the notice of termination did not comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3319.16. The court rejected the teacher's claims. The court ruled that the record supported the trial court's judgment, both in fact and law and that the teacher had waived her right to notice under &sect; 3319.16 because the teacher did not raise any defect in the notice at the administrative hearing before the referee.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the trial court erred by reducing the charge against a co-defendant but refusing to reduce the charge against defendant. The court explained that in cases involving multiple defendants, the court in a bench trial, or the jury, was required to consider the evidence applicable to each defendant as though he were being separately tried and the finding as to each defendant must have been uninfluenced by the determination as to the other or other defendants. The court found that the proof against defendant was determined to have been sufficient to support the conviction. The court rejected defendant's argument that the conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence because there had been overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. The court dismissed defendant's argument challenging the constitutionality of the statutes that criminalized certain drug activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bar owner operated a tavern in which she maintained a billiard table and a mechanical bowling game. The city required a permit for such machines and the owner refused to apply for the necessary permit, although she was advised that her refusal could result in her prosecution. However, before the citation was issued the bar owner ceased operating the tavern. The city attached an affidavit to its motion to dismiss in which the city law director averred that the bar owner would not be prosecuted for past violations. On review the court found that it was apparent from the motion and affidavit that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the city was entitled to judgment as a matter of law under Ohio R. Civ. P. 56(C). The challenged ordinance posed no threat to the bar owner and the court would not pass upon the constitutionality of a legislative act where it did not appear that any attempt had been made to enforce the act. The court would not enter into a speculative inquiry for the purpose of condemning statutory provisions the effect of which in concrete situations not yet developed could not be definitely perceived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The electors claimed that the official, during his tenure as an elected official of a village, had an interest in the profits of a contract with the village. The trial court dismissed the action based on a finding that &sect;&sect; 733.72, 733.78 were unconstitutional because they did not set up a procedure for the removal of officers with any degree of certainty. The court reversed the order dismissing the action. After reviewing &sect;&sect; 733.72, 733.78, the court found that the removal action was essentially a civil proceeding because officials were not fined or imprisoned, but merely prevented from holding office; as the action was civil in nature, the electors had the burden of proving the allegations of their complaint by clear and convincing evidence. Further, &sect; 733.73 specifically provided that the number of jurors required to reach a verdict sustaining the charges was nine out of 12. Though the statutes did not provide procedures for the filing of an answer denying the charges, the omission was immaterial because the electors had to prove the charges by clear and convincing evidence. The statutes were constitutional as a procedure for removal could be determined with certainty.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not commit substantial and prejudicial error in failing to grant defendant's motion for a change in venue because the jurors, at risk for media exposure, were admonished at every separation not to read or watch the media, or talk with other people. The court further held that there was no error in excluding jurors based on their views concerning capital punishment because the law in Ohio permitted the death penalty and both the State and defendant were entitled to jurors who were able to follow the law of the State of Ohio. The court concluded that the death penalty was not cruel and unusual punishment because under state law there was no arbitrary imposition of death.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 145.02 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 145.02 permitted certain classes of former municipal employees, including policemen, firemen, and State highway patrolmen, to participate in the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS), but not others. Plaintiffs contended that &sect; 145.02, as applied to them, violated the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, as well as Ohio Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, in that it denied them the equal protection of the laws, procedural and substantive due process, and their property right. Reversing, the court rejected the Board's contention that there was a rational difference in the type of services demanded of policemen and firemen and the type of services demanded of general municipal employees. The court found that there was no valid distinction between the type of former employment one employee vis a vis that of another and, even if any such distinction existed, it had not been demonstrated. In light of the fact that the right to earn a living and to work on a par with fellow citizens was a fundamental one, close scrutiny of &sect; 145.02 was required. The classifications established by the statute failed to withstand such scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Police stopped defendant for a traffic violation and observed a rifle in plain view in his car. He pleaded guilty to a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2923.56 and argued that the statute was unconstitutional. In affirming his conviction, the court held that a redundancy in the statute did not render it unconstitutionally void for vagueness. Defendant's prosecution did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because he statute met the &quot;sufficiency of purpose&quot; test implicit in Lambert v. California and was not a statute of absolute liability. The act of possessing a firearm was not &quot;wholly passive&quot; conduct to which the analysis in Lambert applied; the action made criminal by the statute was possessing a firearm while under disability, not possessing a firearm while failing to request removal of the disability. The purpose of the statute was not convenience to law enforcement agencies, as in Lambert, but protection of the public. Possible defenses to a prosecution under the statute included the defense that firearm possession was unwitting or involuntary. Therefore, there was no requirement of proof that defendant had notice of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The representative of the class sought a declaration that there was a discriminatory tax classification for country clubs and golf courses in the county. Defendants filed motions to dismiss the action. The trial court granted the motions. The representative appealed. The court affirmed, holding that declaratory relief was inappropriate. The court explained that there was a special statutory procedure in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. chs. 5715 and 5717 used to correct any inequalities in real property taxation rates, making a declaratory judgment unnecessary. The court reasoned that the representative attempted to by-pass the county board of revision and the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals by initiating a declaratory judgment action against defendants in the trial court. Although Ohio R. Civ. P. 57 allowed declaratory relief even when there was another adequate remedy available, the court concluded that declaratory relief should not be granted where a special statutory proceeding had been provided for that purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant twice sold heroin to a police informant. Each time, a recorder on a telephone taped the informant's call to defendant, and the informant wore a transmitter. Affirming, the court held that defendant was properly convicted of both offenses for each incident. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.20(B) prohibited illegal drug sales. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.101 prohibited use of vehicles for the illegal keeping or administering of drugs. The court ruled that defendant's conduct on the two occasions revealed violations of both sections, which were of dissimilar import. Additionally, the court found that the informant's trial testimony was sufficient to sustain the convictions pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2933.58(B). The informant consented to the electronic intrusions and his hope for leniency did not render his consent involuntary because motivation was irrelevant. The court further determined that defendant showed no need for disclosure of the informant's grand jury testimony that outweighed the need for secrecy. Finally, the court concluded that the trial court's refusal to do an in-camera inspection of a transcript of the testimony was not prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court found that clearly the mere use of the word &quot;his&quot; did not, when read in the context of the applicable statute, denote a particular sex or gender. Further, the court determined that that section of the statute was not unconstitutional because it was neither vague, indefinite, overbroad, nor lacked the guidelines for proper enforcement. The record in the instant case revealed that the State met its burden of proof at each stage of the proceedings. It followed that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motions for dismissal. The court held that the curative instructions given by the trial court regarding improper in-court identification were timely, proper, and entirely adequate. The testimony of the State's witnesses was competent and probative, and therefore the trial court did not err in so ruling. Lastly, the court's examination of the record revealed the trial court fully and properly instructed the jury as to the law that applied to the case at bar and that the State adduced substantial probative and credible evidence tending to prove each of the elements of the crime charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employer contended that the statement of policy was not a valid agreement because it could not lawfully enter into a binding collective bargaining agreement with the employees' public labor union. The court held that the granting of an injunction to enforce a contract required that a lawful agreement exist between the parties. The employees conceded that the employer, as a governmental body, was without authority to enter into a binding collective bargaining agreement containing terms of employment that were also covered by conflicting civil service legislation. However, the employees in question were not covered by civil service or other merit legislation. Thus, the details set out in the agreement concerning such matters as wages, hours of work, and conditions of employment for the employees were not in conflict with any other legislation. Furthermore, when the statement of policy was executed, the employer had been given a general administrative authority pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann &sect; 2153.08 to fix the compensation and work condition for the employees, provided that such compensation did not exceed the aggregate amount fixed by the county for such purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff car buyer appealed the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) in his action against defendant credit corporation, seeking recovery for compensatory and punitive damages for the alleged wrongful repossession of the buyer's automobile that was purchased from an automobile dealership on an installment sale contract between the buyer and the credit corporation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After purchasing the automobile and executing the installment sale contract, the buyer breached the contract by defaulting in the payments owing to the credit corporation. Therefore, the credit corporation repossessed the vehicle from a postal employees' parking lot that was owned by the federal government. Thereupon, the buyer insisted that the credit corporation effected a wrongful repossession and that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1309.46 was unconstitutional because it authorized the taking of property without judicial process and thus without notice or hearing. Finding such contentions meritless, the court affirmed the judgment below and held that because the stipulated facts clearly demonstrated the buyer's default under the contract, the credit corporation was legally entitled to repossess the car. Further, the repossession did not involve a breach of the peace or any force, both of which were forbidden by &sect; 1309.46. Thus, the repossession was properly executed under &sect; 1309.46, and the statute was constitutionally valid because no state action was involved in the taking and only self action, which was not forcible and did not breach the peace, was involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State appealed from a judgment of the trial court (Ohio) granting defendant's motion to dismiss. Defendant, indicted on a charge of gross sexual imposition, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2907.05(A)(3), had filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that &sect; 2907.05(A)(3) was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed with the trial court that the statute was so vague that a person could not know if he was violating it. The court found that, very plainly, the statute prohibited the touching of any erogenous zone of another's body, where the other is less than 13, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person. The last phrase ruled out any accidental touching or unknown touching and placed a difficult, but protective, burden on the State. Thus, a normally intelligent person could read the subject statute and know the proscribed conduct. The court rejected the State's argument that defendant should be required to seek a bill of particulars before he could file his motion to dismiss. A bill of particulars was a cure for vagueness in an indictment or charge. If the statute were unconstitutionally vague, there would be no cure to be found in a bill of particulars. Furthermore, this issue was not raised in the trial court and to raise it for the first time on appeal was untimely.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the trial court's judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted a permanent injunction prohibiting the business owner from operating his business in the commercial zone because the auto wrecking business was not a permitted use. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. An auto wrecking yard was not one of the permitted uses in the commercial zone, according to the town zoning resolution. The trial court's ruling and supplemental ruling were judicial opinions. The material contained in the appeal did not appear in the trial court's journal, and the material set forth in the judicial opinions was not before the court for review. Defendant failed to allege the affirmative defense of unconstitutionality of the zoning resolution, and the defense was not properly before the trial court. The defense was one of an affirmative nature and pursuant to Ohio R. Civ.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver of a taxicab picked up four men and drove them to their destination. Two of the passengers left the cab and very shortly thereafter the two who had remained drew knives and took the driver's wristwatch and about $ 5.00 in cash. Defendant was convicted of armed robbery, and he appealed. The omission of the formal representation of counsel at the preliminary hearing did not result in any deprivation of a legal or constitutional right meriting relief upon review. And, while the State's exhibit was not identified as one of the knives used in the robbery, the jury was fully aware of that tenuous identification and was correctly instructed upon the issue of how weight and credit was to be accorded to evidence. Furthermore, the record disclosed evidence from which reasonable minds could have concluded that an armed robbery had been committed and that defendant was one of the perpetrators. Finally, the mandatory sentencing of defendant was not a denial of equal protection. The mere fact that the legislature mandated that &quot;whoever violates Ohio Rev.

The trial court ordered that custody of the child remain with the mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father admitted to paternity of the child, who was born while he was married to another woman. The parties lived together for short periods of time after the child was conceived and born. However, contrary to his stated intentions, the father remained with his wife and never married the mother. The mother later married another man who, the court found, apparently was willing to fulfill the father role with the child. On appeal, the court ruled that the trial court erred in awarding the father visitation over the mother's objection. A putative father, even though he admitted to paternity of an illegitimate child, was not entitled to visitation rights with such child over the objection of the mother, who had the legal right to custody, unless the putative father clearly established that such visitation would be in the best interests of that child. The father presented no such evidence. Moreover, in a case such the father's case, visitation could be granted upon consideration to a de facto family relationship of long-standing existence between father, mother, and child, even though not legitimized, or made de jure, by marriage. There was no such family relationship in the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant mother sought review of the decision of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, Division of Domestic Relations, Juvenile Branch (Ohio), which awarded the right to visit the mother's illegitimate child to plaintiff putative father.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The parties lived together for a period shortly after conception of the mother's child and again for a period of four months before and after the child's birth. However, the father decided to remain with his wife rather than marrying the mother. After the mother married, the father filed an action seeking full custody of the child. The trial court ordered that custody was to remain with the mother but granted the father visitation rights. The court noted that the mother's right to custody, care, and control of her illegitimate child was superior to the father's right. Moreover, the father, even though he admitted paternity, was not entitled to visitation rights over the mother's objection because there was no evidence that such visitation would be in the best interests of the child. Further, the father did not have a constitutional prerogative to all the rights with respect to his illegitimate child that a father divorced or separated from a mother had with respect to their legitimate children. While consideration had to be given to a de facto family relationship of long-standing, there was no evidence of a family relationship between the mother, the father, and the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the portion of the trial court's decision insofar as it found the lawful custody of the child to be in the mother. The court reversed the trial court's decision in all other respects. The cause was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The Administrator denied benefits, and the Board and the trial court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On October 9, 1970, the employee fell from a painting ladder and suffered injuries. On October 30, 1970, he was awarded compensation and was paid benefits for fractures and low back sprain. On December 18, 1972, he asked that an anxiety neurosis diagnosis be considered related to the accident. The Administrator denied his request. Following the exhaustion of administrative remedies, the trial court sustained the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on May 15, 1974. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the statutory right to file an application for modification of an award was a substantive right which accrued at the time of a claimant's injury; (2) when the retroactive application of a statute of limitation operated to destroy an accrued substantive right, such application conflicted with Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 28; and (3) where the last paragraph of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.84 (amended 1967) operated to destroy that accrued substantive right, such operation was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the developer's second request for a change of the zoning of its property from single to multi-family dwellings was denied, it filed a complaint against the city for declaratory judgment and injunction. The common pleas court entered judgment for the developer and held that the public interest would be best served by granting the developer's petition. On appeal, the court reversed and pursuant to Ohio R. Civ. P. 12(B) entered judgment that the zoning resolution was constitutional and dismissed the developer's complaint. The court held that the presumption of the validity of the zoning resolution prevailed. The alleged community need for multi-family dwellings presented by the developer went beyond the city limits. Therefore, it was irrelevant because the basis for determining the constitutionality of the zoning resolution was whether it had a real and substantial relation to the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the city's citizens. The court held that whatever the need for multi-family dwellings of the community outside the city limits might have been, it was not to be considered in the determination of the constitutionality of the city's zoning resolution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver and the passenger were friends who played golf together on a weekly basis. The parties took turns driving to the golf course, but neither compensated the other in any way. During one of the outings, an accident occurred, in which the passenger sustained injuries. When the passenger brought an action against the driver, the trial court denied the claim, finding that the Ohio Guest Statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4515.02, barred recovery. On appeal, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to establish that the driver was negligent in the accident and, but for the Ohio Guest Statute, the passenger would have been able to recover damages from the driver. The court found that the Ohio Guest Statute was unconstitutional because the distinction between paying the driver and riding without compensation was not reasonable and had no fair and substantial relation to the object of legislation.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the marijuana cigarette given to the investigator was admissible because it had a temporal, situational, and logical connection with the offenses charged. The court held that defendant's act of giving the marijuana cigarette to the investigator and his invitation to the investigator to return later, after defendant received a delivery of more marijuana, tended to show defendant's intent to possess marijuana for sale in violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was issued a summons charging him with speeding. He entered a plea of not guilty to the charge and waited for the case to be called to trial. It was called to trial 46 days after the issuance of the summons. Defendant moved for dismissal of the case on the grounds that the offense under which he was charged was a minor misdemeanor and as such a trial should have been held within 15 days of the date of arrest. Defendant further moved, in the alternative, that if the charge was a misdemeanor of the third or fourth degree then he was entitled to have the case discharged on the grounds that a trial should have been held on the matter within 45 days of the date of arrest. The trial court overruled both motions on the grounds that defendant was not charged with commission of a first, second, third, or fourth degree misdemeanor, nor with a minor misdemeanor, but rather with an &quot;unclassified&quot; misdemeanor. Defendant appealed, arguing that the ordinance conflicted with general law and was, therefore, unconstitutional. Defendant founded his conflict argument on the failure of the city to classify misdemeanors as did the criminal code for the State. The court rejected this argument.</SPAN></P>

She later filed an amended complaint, as a representative of a class of persons similarly situated. In her amended complaint, the individual complained that she was a single-family residence owner in a planned unit development; that the city, by ordinance, provided for the removal of garbage from owners of free standing single-family or two-family buildings only, and that the city refused to include the owners of single-family residences in planned unit developments, thus not removing her garbage. She also alleged that the failure to include her in such collection was a denial of equal protection and that the ordinance was an unconstitutional enactment of the city council. She sought a declaratory judgment that her exclusion was unconstitutional. The trial court found in her favor. The court reversed the judgment, by holding that there was not sufficient evidence to justify the trial court's order because the individual did not provide it with judicial notice of the city ordinance in question, nor did she file a copy of such ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the Franklin County Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted him of violating Columbus, Ohio, City Code &sect;&sect; 2131.33 and 2133.08. The convictions arose out of an automobile accident in which the passenger in defendant's car was killed. Defendant claimed that violating Columbus, Ohio, City Code &sect; 2131.33, which required a driver to exercise reasonable and ordinary control over a vehicle was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of second degree homicide under Columbus, Ohio, City Code &sect; 2133.08, based on the death of his passenger due to defendant's violation of Columbus, Ohio, City Code &sect; 2131.33. Defendant claimed that &sect; 2131.33 was vague in its requirement that a person operating a vehicle shall exercise reasonable and ordinary control over such vehicle. The court noted that the state supreme court had construed the state &quot;reckless operation&quot; statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.20, as requiring operation of motor vehicles in accordance with a reasonably prudent person standard. The court held that Columbus, Ohio, City Code &sect; 2131.33 defined substantially the same offense as Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.20. This construction was necessary to save the city ordinance, even though it then created an overlap with the City's own &quot;reckless operation&quot; ordinance, Columbus, Ohio, City Code &sect; 2133.02(A). In response to defendant's claims that the evidence was insufficient and that his motion for a directed verdict should have been granted, the court reviewed the evidence and found it sufficient to sustain the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found for the rental company and awarded damages. The court also entered judgment for the prospective purchaser against the lessee and rejected all claims to title except the claim of the rental company. The prospective purchaser sought review, claiming the judgment for the rental company was error and the judgment against the lessee was inadequate. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court's rejection of the lessee and prospective purchaser's claims to title. As to the former, the court found that the lessee did not have a valid purchase option.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of a trial court, Cuyahoga County (Ohio) convicting him, on a guilty plea, to a lesser included offense of former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01, known as indecent exposure. At the time of defendant's plea, the Ascherman Act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2947.25 required that persons pleading guilty to offenses under former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2903.01 be examined for a mental condition before sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was examined for a mental condition, and a hearing under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2947.25 found him to be a &quot;psychopathic personality.&quot; Defendant was given a suspended prison sentence and committed to a hospital. A hearing took place under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2947.27 wherein probation was denied and a sentence ordered. Defendant contended that the Act on its face was unconstitutional. Further, the State at the probation hearing allegedly did not meet its burden of proof under the Act to justify no probation. Last, defendant was allegedly denied equal protection as significant differences existed between commitment and release under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2947.24-.20 (1969) and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5922.11-.16., 5922-27 (1973). The three assignments of error lacked merit. The Act was not void for vagueness because its definitions of psychopathic personality were overbroad. Also, the Act examinations were not adversary in nature, but sentencing alternatives with proper constitutional safeguards. Regarding probation, a presumption of regularity existed with a skimpy record, and a review of the trial court's discretionary action did not find abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of a judgment of the Williams County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which convicted him of possession of a hallucinogen for sale, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.44(B), and sale of a hallucinogen, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.44(D). The hallucinogenic substance was marijuana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced for selling 2 ounces of marijuana. He had 11 bags in his possession and there was circumstantial evidence that the bags contained marijuana for the purpose of sale. During the course of trial, the State was permitted, over defendant's objection, to introduce evidence that the agents had observed a sale of mescaline to a 14 year old. On appeal, defendant argued in part that the trial court erroneously permitted the State to introduce evidence of other drug transactions in order to inflame the jury. He also argued that his punishment was unconstitutional because it was cruel and unusual. The court found that evidence of the mescaline sale was admissible to show a plan of dealing in drug transactions and it was relevant to the offense charged. However, the court found that defendant's sentence of 20 to 40 years in prison under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3719.99(F) for selling marijuana was unconstitutional because the legislature had reclassified marijuana from a narcotic to a hallucinogen but it had retained the same penalty for selling the drug as if defendant had sold a narcotic. Thus, the court reversed defendant's conviction for selling the drug.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for possession of a hallucinogen for sale. The court reversed his conviction and sentence for selling marijuana. The court remanded the case to the trial court for execution of sentence and to assess the costs equally between defendant and the State.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the board had actual notice of the appeal when it received a notice of the appeal within the time provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2505.04. The fact that the landowners filed their notice of appeal with the clerk of the court of common pleas and not with the clerk of the board of county commissioners did not affect the purpose of the notice. Considerable testimony indicated that the general good of the territory to be annexed would benefit by annexation, and the board's denial was arbitrary and unreasonable because it did not approve the annexation when the good of the territory was shown as required by Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 1351.09 was void for vagueness. Defendant also claimed the ordinance was not within the police powers of the municipality, was unreasonable and discriminatory, and did not bear a substantial relation to the purpose sought. Defendant also contended that &sect; 1351.09 was unconstitutional because it was retroactive in effect. The trial court's judgment was affirmed. The court found that no one had to guess at what &quot;good repair&quot; meant. &quot;Good repair&quot; was easily understood by men of common intelligence with respect to screens on windows. Further, defendant was charged with having &quot;no screens&quot; on the windows. The court noted that the intent of &sect; 1351.09 was to regulate buildings, which was within the municipality's police powers. Requiring screens in good repair in non-air conditioned windows was reasonable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Garfield Heights Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted him after a jury trial of reckless operation of a motor vehicle.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court granted his motion for appointed counsel, but ruled it moot due to defendant appearing with his daughter who was an attorney. On review, the court affirmed his conviction. The court held, inter alia, that the trial court's failure to appoint assigned counsel when retained counsel represented defendant was not error. The court found no abuse of the trial court's discretion in denying his motion for appointment of counsel on appeal and furnishing the transcript. The court concluded that defendant had a source of income. The court further found that the trial court did not err in not requiring that a bill of particulars be given to defendant at the beginning of the trial because a person charged with a misdemeanor in a municipal court was not entitled to a bill of particulars. He was not denied due process nor tried by an improper jury. Any error in the selection process of potential jurors by the local jury commissioner was not such to cause prejudice to defendant. Finally, the court held that he was not denied his right to a speedy trial because at the time of arrest and trial, statutory time limits in which a trial of a misdemeanor must occur were not in effect.</SPAN></P>

Summary judgment was granted for defendant and plaintiff appealed. The court reversed the decision of the lower court and held that the false quotation was defamatory on its face. The court rejected defendant's contention that the New York Times rule applied and held that litigation involving private individuals who sought damages for publication of a defamatory falsehood were governed by the principles announced by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Gertz decision.

Code Ann. &sect; 2905.27. Defendant also appealed his convictions for events on other dates for improper dress in violation of Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a man who dressed in female clothes and frequented an area known for prostitution. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to dismiss the improper dress charges because it was within the police powers of the state to enact legislation prohibiting a person from appearing upon any public street impersonating a member of the opposite sex. The court affirmed its prior decision in another case that &sect; 2343.04 did not require a showing that the female apparel was worn for an illegal purpose. The court held that just because defendant was a transsexual person he was not entitled to wear women's clothing in public because a homosexual person had no constitutional rights not shared by the public in general. The court found that the ordinance did not violate defendant's right of privacy because he had appeared in a public place in a dress not belonging to his sex. Defendant had no fundamental right meriting special constitutional protection. The court held that it was not necessary for the vice squad officer to actually perform an act to convict defendant of a lewd act. The offer for the sexual act had been made when a price was determined.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also argued that the evidence did not support the conviction for murder. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that: (1) defendant did not abandon the criminal conspiracy; instead, defendant hid behind the counter and disposed of his weapon after the shooting had started; and (2) the trial court had the discretion to make the five 25-year sentences that it imposed on defendant consecutive to the two life sentences that it had given him; the consecutive sentences were not cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested in another county pursuant to a search warrant that was issued based on the statements of his girlfriend, which implicated him in a burglary and the charged murder. Because defendant was in custody, a separate warrant never issued for his arrest for the murder charge. Defendant contended that because his confessions were the fruit of an unlawful arrest, the confessions should have been suppressed. Defendant argued the arrest for the burglary was unlawful because the search warrant was not valid where the warrant order was signed by a person, acting at the time of issue as a deputy clerk of the municipal court, an allegedly biased person. The court disagreed. The court found that the overwhelming evidence of probable cause submerged the effect of any error arising from the issuance of a warrant by a &quot;deputy clerk&quot; who sometimes wore another hat. There was in fact substantial support for an arrest without a warrant because a realization by defendant of the possible result of his &quot;confessions&quot; to his fiance might have produced an early departure. Also, a plea of not guilty waived all defects in reference to the authority of the person issuing the warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the husband argued that trial court erred in granting custody to the wife and in granting the wife alimony. The husband further claimed that the trial court erred in failing to divide the personal property or personal effects of the parties or in considering the vehicles of the parties. The court held that the alimony award was proper because the granting of alimony was permitted by statute without regard to the conduct of the wife. Moreover, the alimony awarded to the wife was within the sound discretion of the trial court. The court also found that both minor children were of an age permitting them to choose the parent with whom they wish to live provided that the parent was not unfit and that the trial court's procedure in awarding custody was reasonable. However, the court modified the trial court's judgment and ordered that the wife deliver all of the personal property and personal effects of the husband in her possession. The court ruled that the husband's vehicle was to be considered to be his property, and the wife's vehicle was to be considered her property.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant failed to appear for her trial on a charge of petit larceny under Euclid, Ohio, Codified Ordinance &sect; 537.12, the Euclid Municipal Court (Ohio) ordered her to show cause why she should not be held in contempt. Thereafter, finding that defendant had failed to show cause, the trial court found her in contempt, fined her $ 500 and costs, and sentenced her to 10 days in the workhouse. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pled not guilty to a charge of petit larceny and demanded a jury trial, but did not appear for trial. After the trial court found her in contempt and imposed a fine and 10-day sentence, defendant filed an affidavit of indigency requesting a deferred payment schedule for her fine. The trial court overruled defendant's request. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court jailed her beyond the 10-day maximum provided in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2705.05 because of her inability to pay the fine. Given defendant's affidavit of indigency, the court held that the trial court erred in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine the merit of defendant's allegations of inability to satisfy her fine and thus whether her failure to pay the fine was voluntary or involuntary. Absent a determination on this issue, the trial court's order was an unconstitutional denial of equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The imprisonment for involuntary non-payment of a fine by an indigent was a denial of equal protection regardless of how any per diem credit toward payment of the fine was established, and regardless of the monetary amount of such credit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a putative class of retired public employees, appealed a decision of the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County (Ohio), which dismissed the employees' action against defendants, Tax Commissioner of Ohio and Treasurer of Ohio, for a declaratory judgment that the October 1972 amendments made to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 145.56 and 3307.71 were unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The putative class of retired public employees all retired prior to the October 1972 amendments to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 145.56 and 3307.71, which resulted in the taxation of their retirement benefits. The trial court dismissed the employees' suit based upon a finding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action because the employees' failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals. Reversing the judgment, the court noted that the Board lacked the power to determine the constitutionality of the challenged statutory amendments. The court concluded that the controversy presented by the employees' fit the basic concepts required in a declaratory judgment action as incorporated in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2721.03. Thus, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the suit. The court pointed out that the changes in the law affected the income of the employees' adversely and allegedly destroyed the vested interests of the recipients, thousands in number, in the retirement systems of Ohio. To require the thousands of beneficiaries each to file for a refund with the Commissioner would produce an impossible composite burden.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was a stock brokerage that owned shares of a certain corporation. In its dealer intangible tax return for 1968, the taxpayer listed the stock at its cost, with the book value of the shares at calendar year end as being the original cost, adjusted for stock splits and sales. The taxpayer also claimed a deduction from market value of a dealer in intangibles. The tax commissioner rejected the claim, and assessed the valuation of the shares at the market value on the taxing date. The taxpayer appealed to the board of tax appeals, which affirmed that decision. The taxpayer appealed and the court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part. The court held that market or book value were not fixed criteria, but were elements in determining fair value. The court found that the tax commissioner failed to do its duty in that it did not arrive at its own determination of the value of the stock. The court found that the order of the board of tax appeals, affirming the order of the tax commissioner in assessing the true value of all of the stock as the market value thereof at the tax date, was erroneous, contrary to law, and against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Pursuant to Ohio Rev.

The taxpayers filed an action seeking an injunction against the performance of the contract, and for other equitable relief. The trial court found in favor of the university and director of public works and dismissed the taxpayers' complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that &sect; 123.77 was a constitutionally valid statute and was not merely a provision for the disposition of surplus university property, but was a provision for the development of such lands for industrial, distribution, commercial, or research facilities as set forth in Ohio Const. art. VIII, &sect; 13. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 123.77, did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority and granted only such discretionary authority to the director of the Ohio Department of Public Works, to carry out the specific intent and purposes of the act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer was a vendor who failed to file monthly sales tax returns required by law. As a result, the Commissioner allegedly assessed a 600 percent delinquency charge. The Board affirmed the assessment. The taxpayer sought further review. The court held that the Board's decision and order were reasonable and lawful, and that the assessment made against the taxpayer was in harmony with the applicable statutes. In addition to the dollar-per-day assessment required by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.12, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.13 provided that an additional 15 percent shall be added to the amount of every assessment. Absent a showing that the Commissioner failed to properly determine the amount of the assessment, the court concluded that the assessment was correct. Likewise, absent a showing that the taxpayer was in some specific way denied due process of law, the court concluded that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5739.12 was constitutional and properly applied to the facts. In sum, the taxpayer's failure to file monthly returns as required by law was a proper condition precedent to the Commissioner's actions, and the record was devoid of any evidence of discrimination against the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer owned apartments and sought to compel the municipality to resume the collection of garbage and refuse. The taxpayer prayed for damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and injunctive relief. The court first granted the taxpayer's motion to dismiss the municipality's cross-appeal. Under Ohio R. App. P. 4(A), the municipality did not provide notice of cross-appeal within 10 days after the notice of appeal. However, the court could consider the matters of the cross-appeal under Ohio R. App. P. 12(B). The court affirmed the trial court's holding that the lawsuit was not a taxpayer's action under Ohio Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 733.59. The action was not brought in a representative capacity for the community as a whole. The court agreed that the municipality's mayor and director of public service promulgated rules that were not authorized under the ordinance relating to refuse and solid wastes. The public powers conferred upon a municipal corporation and its officers or agents could not be surrendered or delegated to others. The trial court, however, issued the mandatory injunction on a wider basis than permitted. The relief as sought could only be related to the parties involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was originally indicted on eight counts of receiving and/or concealing stolen property. Three of the counts were tried to a jury and a verdict of not guilty returned. Of the remaining five counts, one was dismissed and defendant was convicted on the remaining four counts. The evidence against defendant was substantially based on the testimony of co-defendants, who agreed to testify for the State. The court held that the matter of the credibility of the testimony of the co-defendants was within the province of the jury and that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the essential elements charged in the indictment. Therefore, the trial court did not err in failing to sustain the motions for acquittal. The court also concluded that the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence of prior acts because such evidence was relevant to defendant's knowledge that the property was stolen. Finally, the court found that the prosecution's grant of partial immunity to the co-defendants in return for their testimony against defendant did not violate equal protection and that defendant's convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted on one count of breaking and entering, and a jury in the trial court, Cuyahoga County (Ohio) returned a guilty verdict against him. He appealed, contending that he was denied his statutory right to a speedy trial as guaranteed by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71 and that the State failed to prove intent, an essential element to the crime of burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The record disclosed that defendant was confined in the county jail from the day of his arrest on October 13, 1973, until the day of his trial on February 14, 1974, a period of 126 days. Defendant was tried in the term of court immediately following the term of his indictment, and there was no violation of defendant's statutory right to a speedy trial as delineated in the pre-January 1, 1974 version of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.71. The statute was amended, and the court held that under the amended version of &sect; 2945.71, persons who committed an offense prior to January 1, 1974, and who were indicted and held in jail in lieu of bail on a felony charge after that date had to be tried within two terms after the term of their indictment, or within 90 days of January 1, 1974, whichever was earlier. Defendant's trial was well within the provisions of that rule. When defendant was arrested he had one leg over a bar across the front door of a store. The front window of the door had been broken, and defendant's hand was cut and bleeding. From these facts and circumstances, a reasonable jury could have concluded that defendant had the requisite intent to commit a burglary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Administrator allowed a claim for an injured back, hips, and tailbone, and decedent was paid temporary total disability compensation, after which he received temporary partial disability compensation until his death. The employer and Administrator claimed that the law at the time of the lower court's ruling did not permit his widow to participate in the Workmen's Compensation Fund for death benefits. The lower court treated a motion for summary judgment as a motion to dismiss. While that was error, it was not prejudicial error, as there was no prejudice to the employer, who had received a full trial on the merits. The court held that where decedent had received payment of workmen's compensation for temporary partial disability in the year next preceding his death, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.59 required that the Administrator consider the application of the surviving spouse for death benefits, where death was alleged to have been caused by such work-related injury. The court held that even though the lower court may have been wrong in its determination as what to what law was applicable to the claim, its final judgment was correct.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled defendant's motion to suppress evidence secured by use of a search warrant. Defendant contended that the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause and that the magistrate improperly heard additional testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence because the affidavit was defective in that it did not set forth adequate information to find probable cause and the magistrate could not cure the defective affidavit by hearing additional testimony. Defendant also claimed that the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant's discovery motion and in failing to order the prosecution to elect to prosecute defendant under statutes containing lesser penalties. Finally, defendant asserted that there was insufficient evidence to find defendant guilty of possession with intent to sell. The court held that the magistrate had the right to rehabilitate an otherwise insufficient affidavit so long as the additional testimony was under oath and made on the record. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's discovery motion and in determining that the election of the prosecution to charge defendant under a particular statute did not violate equal protection. Finally, the court concluded that there was only sufficient evidence to convict defendant of possession on the cocaine charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified defendant's conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to sell to a conviction for the lesser included offense of possession and therefore reduced defendant's sentence on that charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The City established an experimental program to prohibit the posting of real estate signs within a designated area of the city; the &quot;Demonstration Area&quot; affected by the Ordinance was an area that had undergone significant integration in the prior ten years. The homeowner lived within the designated area, wanted to sell his home, and wished to post a real estate sign to advertise that fact. The trial court enjoined the City from enforcing the Ordinance; it held that the Ordinance was unconstitutional because it did not have uniform application throughout the city as required by Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 26, and created an arbitrary class in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2. In affirming, the court held that Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 26 was not applicable. It found the Ordinance to constitutionally infirm under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 2 because the Demonstration Area was chosen based upon racial criteria, the restrictions did not apply to all similarly situated neighborhoods, and no compelling city interest justified the discrimination. The Ordinance created an impermissible constitutional burden on the fundamental right to choose where one lives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which dismissed defendant's petition to vacate his sentence upon a postconviction determination of his constitutional rights pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2953.21. Defendant was convicted of possession of an article intended for causing abortion; his conviction and sentence were affirmed and his appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court was dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court erred as a matter of law in not sustaining his petition for post-conviction relief on the basis that the conviction was in violation of the state and federal constitutions. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred as a matter of law in not setting aside his conviction on his postconviction petition in that said conviction was predicated under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.34, which by incorporation was ruled nonconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. The court, in affirming, stated that in Roe v. Wade it was specifically recognized that states had the authority to regulate abortions to the extent of requiring any abortion to be performed by a licensed physician. Therefore, since the decision of Roe v. Wade, the language of former Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.34 at issue was limited to non-physicians who were not associated with licensed physicians permitted to perform abortions and, as so interpreted, such provision was constitutionally valid. Defendant was not a licensed physician and was not associated with any licensed physician when the abortion was performed; therefore, the provisions of former &sect; 2905.34 applied to him.</SPAN></P>

Civ. P. 12(C). Furthermore, the trial court's judgment entry was not required under Ohio R. Civ. P. 58 to be labeled &quot;judgment entry.&quot; Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.02 was not vague or indefinite, and taxpayers were actually required to pay the tax under the law, notwithstanding that the withholding provision of the law, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.06, only required that an employer deduct the tax in periodic installments from the employee's pay. The tax was not a capitation, or poll tax, because not every citizen had to pay a tax under &sect; 5747.02. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5747.08(E), which resulted in some married taxpayers paying more than similarly situated single taxpayers, was not an invidious classification which violated equal protection, because the purpose of the entire act was proper and the purpose of &sect; 5747.08(E) was to minimize the cost of auditing returns and to minimize tax evasion.</SPAN></P>

AP-3-08 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3704.05(G) because it found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3704.01 et seq. were in contravention of the Ohio Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court concluded that by the enactment of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3704.01 et seq., the General Assembly had delegated its discretion to make law to the Director of Environmental Protection and that these sections did not provide adequate standards to guide the Director in the exercise of his discretion. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 3704 established an interwoven statutory scheme in which the power of the Director to adopt regulations was carefully circumscribed and, therefore, satisfied the general rule that legislative standards were required in statutes conferring administrative discretion and complied fully with Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1. The court found also that neither state nor federal constitutional provisions protecting personal liberty and private property prohibited the regulation of constitutional guarantees in the interest of the health, safety, or welfare of the people; thus, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. ch. 3704 did not violate Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 1. Finally, the court found that Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In her complaint, the heir alleged that she was the daughter of the decedent and the stepdaughter and heir at law of the decedent's deceased wife. She further alleged that the grantee acquired certain real estate from the deceased wife, who was incompetent and comatose at the time she executed the deed, and that the wife lacked capacity to execute the deed. She maintained that she was entitled to a share of the real estate as the stepdaughter under the half-and-half statute and otherwise as the daughter of the decedent, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2105.06(B). In his motion for summary judgment, the grantee argued that at the time the heir was born, her natural mother was not married to the person she alleged to be her natural father, namely, the decedent, and that he never formally acknowledged the heir as his child, nor did he adopt her. The court concluded that the heir was not, in fact, the illegitimate child of the decedent and, therefore, not a child under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2105.06. She was consequently not entitled to a share in his property under &sect; 2105.06, the statute of descent and distribution, or under Ohio Rev.

Defendant was talking on a telephone a short distance from the corner of a desk whereupon a cash register was located, and where a customer was standing by such cash register. The officers proceeded to jump over the counter and frisk defendant; the officers then presented defendant a copy of the warrant and placed handcuffs on him.

The court held that the averment of the indictment expressed a sufficient intent on the part of defendant to satisfy the elements of a possession for sale charge.

The Bureau suspended the motorist's license. The motorist filed a petition in the trial court. At the trial, the officer did not testify that he observed anything that indicated the motorist was under the influence of alcohol or intoxicated; there was no odor of alcohol and the motorist did not have slurred speech or any unsteadiness on his feet. The officer was not asked to express an opinion as to whether the motorist was intoxicated. The trial court found there was no probable cause for an arrest. On appeal, the court noted that an arresting officer was not required to personally observe a motorist operating his car in order to charge him with operating the vehicle under the influence of alcohol. The officer was required, however, to have some basis for believing the motorist was intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol. The record was void of any evidence that the motorist was intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statutes of the state of Ohio provided a method by which a refund could be had for a corporate franchise tax that had already been remitted, and such was to be found within Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5733.12. Upon an adverse decision, the taxpayer could appeal to the board of appeals pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5717.02. Upon another adverse ruling, the taxpayer could resort to the courts by appeal to the court of appeals or the supreme court pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5717.04. Because the statutes provided a specific administrative procedure wherein the taxpayer could claim its refund, such procedure would have been the proper means of obtaining relief. Because the taxpayer did not follow the statutory review procedures it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The ex-wife was granted a divorce on her cross-complaint and the decree incorporated a separation agreement requiring the ex-husband to pay $ 325 per month support for the parties' two minor daughters. The ex-wife filed a motion of contempt for his failure to pay support and the ex-husband filed a motion for termination of those payments since she denied him visitation rights. The referee made a recommendation for a partial suspension of support payments until the ex-husband was granted visitation rights. He was also found in contempt for failing to make payments ordered by the court. The trial court rejected the suspension of child support payments. The trial court later adopted the recommendation that the ex-husband's suspension of payments be allowed. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, finding that even though the evidence was conflicting as to his exercise of visitation rights, the suspension of an order was not a modification, but an automatic cutoff of support without any evidence or determination of what was just pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3109.05. The court found no evidence that the ex-wife was responsible for any interference with his visitation rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff taxpayer filed a complaint with defendant county board of revision as to an assessment of real property and sought a reduction in a tax valuation of land and buildings, and the board denied any reduction. The taxpayer filed an appeal to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) from the board's order. From an adverse judgment of the common pleas court, the board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appeal was directed solely to what was conceded by both parties to be the use by the common pleas court of the statewide common average percentage level of assessment for the three years in question, as opposed to the use by the board of the higher county assessment percentages. The common pleas court felt itself constrained to apply a statewide common level of assessment to the true market value for the three years in issue and, accordingly, corrected what it held to be the discriminatory valuation resulting from the board's initial application of the county common level of assessment. After a careful review of the authorities cited to the court by the parties, the court was unable to find that the common pleas court erred in rendering such a judgment. The use by the common pleas court of the statewide common level of assessment against the true or actual value of the taxpayer's property seemed to conform to the requirements of Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2 and U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The court noted that the appeal was prosecuted to the common pleas court unencumbered by the limitations of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 5715.19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the common pleas court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, the officer of a corporation, sought review of a judgment of the Franklin County Municipal Court (Ohio), which found the officer guilty of a violation of an ordinance of appellee city. The officer allegedly failed to make a sidewalk in a city street under the supervision and control and to the satisfaction and approval of the city engineer. The officer was fined as a result.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officer testified that he approved pouring the concrete sidewalk despite the fact that he knew such approval had not been given by the city inspector. On appeal, the officer contended that Columbus, Ohio, City Code &sect; 905.01 was unconstitutional, void for vagueness, and was an illegal delegation of legislative power. He also asserted that the city engineer was unreasonable and arbitrary in his refusal to approve construction of the sidewalk. The court rejected the officer's argument that the city ordinance was unconstitutional because the officer failed to clearly show that the law contravened the constitution in some express provision. However, the court reversed the trial court's judgment because the city's affidavit filed against the officer was not proper as it did not expressly state what specific violation occurred. The city was entitled to correct the affidavit and proceed accordingly.</SPAN></P>

He challenged the admission of testimony of alleged similar acts under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59 and the jury instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was indicted and convicted for abduction for immoral purposes, assault with intent to rape, and sodomy. He was also charged under a second indictment, which was separated for trial, for the same, plus an additional offense, committed upon a second victim. The second victim testified at the first trial regarding alleged similar acts of defendant. On appeal, the court held that because defendant had offered an alibi and placed the identity of the perpetrator in issue, the second victim's testimony was admissible pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2945.59. Defendant's conduct with the second victim constituted similar acts and tended to show defendant's scheme in doing the alleged acts. The court held that &sect; 2945.58, as it related to the introduction of subsequent, previous, or contemporaneous acts, was constitutional. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the guilty verdict. However, due to the inadequate record, the court deferred its decisions on the judgment of conviction and on defendant's contention that the jury instructions regarding the alleged similar acts were error until the trial court filed a supplemental record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Kettering Municipal Court (Ohio), which convicted him of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Defendant contended that the police did not comply with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191 by failing to administer a chemical test upon defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was pulled over by the police, and he failed to perform field sobriety tests. No chemical tests were given. Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The police officer's failure to perform his duty to give chemical tests or a blood alcohol test as required by &sect; 4511.191 did not preclude the prosecution of defendant. While it was erroneous to permit the police officer to testify as to the attitude of a judge toward the use of a breathalyzer test, especially where the case was tried before a different judge, such error was not prejudicial. No test was given to defendant, so there was no test to be evaluated by the jury. Accordingly, the opinion of another judge as to the reliability of the breathalyzer test was irrelevant. The evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find that defendant was under the influence of alcohol. There was evidence of defendant's erratic driving, the odor of an alcoholic beverage on defendant's breath and inside his automobile, defendant's admission that he had been to a party and had been drinking, and the manner of defendant's performance of the finger-to-nose and heel-to-toe tests.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reversed the board's decision, holding that the township ordinances did not prohibit the parking of trailers on the owner's property. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court rejected the neighbors' contention that the trial court's judgment was contrary to statute and case law.

Code Ann. &sect; 2905.301, and of interrupting or disturbing a lawful assemblage, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3761.11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested on charges relating to an incident at a university meeting to hear speakers discuss proposed changes to the Ohio Criminal Code. Defendant allegedly called a speaker, who was a judge, a &quot;goddam pig and motherfucker.&quot; One of the university students, presumably protecting the judge from bodily harm, struck defendant hard enough to dislodge his helmet. Thereafter, a jury found defendant guilty of violating &sect; 3761.11 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.301. The court denied the prosecution's motion to dismiss defendant's appeal because the fact that defendant had served his sentence and paid his fine did not mechanically foreclose consideration of the merits of the appeal. However, defendant's language plainly involved &quot;fighting words.&quot; Further, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3761.11 was narrowly drawn and protected the right to assemble peaceably. Moreover, a review of the trial court's entire charge did not reveal prejudicial error. Finally, applying the totality of the circumstances standard, the prosecution's identification evidence was admissible because it was based upon independent observations of defendant at the time of the incident by five witnesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners' property was originally zoned for single-family residential use only. The owners applied for a permit to have the property rezoned for commercial purposes. When the permit was denied, the owners filed an action to have the zoning ordinance declared unconstitutional and void. The trial court entered judgment for the village, finding that the village did not act in an arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory manner in denying the permit. On appeal, the court held that the existing zoning, as it applied to the subject property, constituted an unconstitutional depravation of the right of the owners to the use of their property. The uncontroverted testimony at trial established that the subject property as zoned could not have been developed for any appreciable use. The court determined that the property could only be used commercially and that such use would not adversely affect the health, safety, or welfare of the community. The court stated that because a declaratory judgment action was not an extraordinary remedy, the owners were not required to exhaust all of their administrative remedies by applying for a building permit before instituting their action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The manufacturer had one access road. The city passed an ordinance that prohibited commercial truck traffic on Sundays. The manufacturer sought a declaration that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court granted a temporary injunction. The city moved to dismiss. The manufacturer served the Attorney General. The trial court granted the motion. The manufacturer appealed. The court affirmed. Although it was not necessary to make the Attorney General a party to the action, service upon the Attorney General was prerequisite under &sect; 2721.12 for jurisdiction. Although &sect; 2721.12 was silent as to the requirements of service upon the Attorney General, the court construed &sect; 2721.12 as requiring the same time and manner of service as required on an opposing party under Ohio R. Civ. P. 4, 4.1, and 4.3. Because the Attorney General was served the day before the hearing to dismiss, the trial court had lacked jurisdiction and had properly dismissed the action. The Attorney General's failure to move for a continuance was not a waiver of the service requirements of &sect; 2721.12 because procedurally a motion for a continuance would have followed an unsuccessful motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The rider and the driver travelled to and from college together. When the accident occurred the driver negligently lost control of her vehicle, which caused injuries to the rider. The rider filed suit, and the trial court instructed the jury on the &quot;guest statute&quot; and allowed the jury to determine whether the money that changed hands was for payment for transportation or was a sharing of the cost of gasoline and oil consumed on the trip. The jury rendered a verdict in favor of the driver, and the rider appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. The passenger claimed that the &quot;guest statute,&quot; pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4515.02, was unconstitutional. The court determined that the statute was constitutional and that the issue of payment was a fact question for the jury in light of the rider's conflicting testimony at deposition and at trial. A limitation of liability for &quot;guest's&quot; injuries to wilful or wanton misconduct was not an unconstitutional violation of Equal Protection. The rider failed to make objection to jury instructions before the jury retired to deliberate, which did not preserve the issues for appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and the co-defendant were tried. The co-defendant was found guilty, but the jury could not reach a verdict as to defendant. On retrial, defendant was convicted, and he appealed. The court reversed the conviction for possession of a narcotic drug for sale because there was no evidence that defendant possessed any drugs for sale. No inference of guilt in relation to any specific occupier of the motel was shown by the mere fact of the presence of narcotics on the motel premises.

The landowners attempted to enjoin the construction of the building and the trial court denied their petition for relief. On appeal, the court agreed with the landowners that the order for the issuance of the permit was void because the developer failed to exhaust its administrative remedies by seeking a building permit. The trial court was without authority to rule on the developer's constitutional argument when other issues remained. The trial court was authorized to grant declaratory relief to zoning ordinances.

The bookstore owners argued that &sect; 2905.34 was unconstitutional. The court rejected the bookstore owners' argument and found that &sect; 2905.34 was not vague or overbroad. The court found that the injunction was overbroad and held that it was invalid in so far as it enjoined materials that were not obscene. The court held that the Fourth Amendment required that law enforcement officers were required to secure a warrant even where their purpose was to gather sample copies of books and magazines for use as evidence in a subsequent prosecution.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested by two sheriff's deputies for selling of an obscene magazine. One deputy testified that he entered a store in which defendant was seated at the cash register, that the deputy purchased the magazine, that he left the premises and examined the magazine in the presence of the second officer in the parking lot, and that the two officers then arrested defendant. The trial court convicted defendant of selling obscene material. Defendant appealed, contending that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.35, the section upon which the prosecution was based, and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.34, a definitional section, were unconstitutional and that defendant's arrest and prosecution was unconstitutional because there was no step by which an impartial magistrate focused searchingly on the question of obscenity prior to defendant's arrest. On appeal, the court held that the statutes in question were constitutional under Ohio law, that there was no requirement for the involvement of a magistrate because there was no search or seizure of evidence conducted without a warrant and because a misdemeanor, the sale of the obscene magazine, was committed in the presence of a police officer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the jury acquitted defendant of showing obscene films, the trial court refused to release and return the two seized obscene films to defendant.

The court agreed, reversed the trial court's refusal to release the films, and ordered the trial court to return the films to defendant. The court held that seizure without a warrant, especially of films, was unconstitutional in the absence of exigent circumstances, a &quot;now or never&quot; situation. The stipulated statement of facts showed that the police had seized the films when they arrested defendant and there were no exigent, now or never, circumstances when the films were seized. The court concluded that courts scrutinized any large scale seizure of books, films, or other materials for the sole purpose of destruction or to prevent distribution to be certain that the requirements of decisions relating to a prior judicial determination of obscenity in an adversary proceeding were met.</SPAN></P>

The statute outlawing the possession of a weapon by a person who met the test for a prior felony was not unconstitutionally vague. An automobile could have been a dangerous instrument in defendant's hands. The assault conviction was a crime of both violence and moral turpitude.

The car turned over, and defendant was positioned next to a shotgun. The gun was unloaded. On appeal, the court found no errors. The court held that the conjunctive &quot;and&quot; in the statute meant that the prior felony had to be one of violence and moral turpitude. The outlawing of the possession of a weapon by one who had a prior conviction for violence and a crime of moral turpitude was not unconstitutionally vague.

The trial court found that the property owner no longer wanted to sell campers and so the appeal was moot. On appeal, the court reversed, vacated the judgment of the trial court, and affirmed the Board's decision. The court found that the trial court's decision was based on the finding that the appeal had become moot. The court found that the township's zoning ordinance was not consistent with the requirements of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 519.14. The court found that the standard was more lenient towards the property owner, so he could not complain about the standard. The court found that the trial court erred when it found the appeal was moot because the property owner still wanted to make use of the property for some of the other uses in the variance, but he had never shown that he was entitled to the variance.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendants argued that the trial court erred in admitting the in-court identification of defendants by State witnesses because pre-trial police procedures utilized to identify defendants were unconstitutionally conducted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution produced testimony demonstrating that two males entered a restaurant at approximately 9 p.m. on January 3, 1978, and robbed, at gun point, the manager and his assistant. Additionally, both the manager and his assistant were struck on the head with the gun and knocked unconscious. At trial, both the manager and the assistant identified both defendants as the males responsible for the robbery and assaults. Additionally, the prosecution presented the testimony of an 18 year old acquaintance of defendants who claimed that he had heard them discuss the robbery of the restaurant. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) where a deputy provided the manager and his assistant with seven photographs and asked each victim if they could identify any one of the seven and if so to circle on a separate piece of paper the number corresponding to the identification, no suggestive procedures were used by the deputy in the identification process; and (2) there was nothing in the record to support the proposition that the prosecution used its preemptory challenges in such a way as to systematically exclude all blacks from the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that his activities, including throwing items at the police, were related to an anti-war demonstration and were thus protected by the First Amendment. As a result, defendant claimed that &sect; 2923.53 was unconstitutional. The court held that the conviction was proper. Section 2923.53 was constitutional because it was not vague, overbroad, or without standards in its use of the term &quot;tumultuous.&quot; The court reasoned that tumultuous, in the context of &sect; 2923.53, required an intent to be violent, rather than just being rowdy. Thus, no additional limitations were required to be written into &sect; 2923.53 to protect First Amendment rights where defendant's activities went beyond speech and went to violent actions. Thus, the limitation that the activity had to be a clear and present danger to be a crime was built into &sect; 2923.53. The motion to suppress evidence obtained through electronic surveillance was properly denied because defendant failed to show specific evidence that it was tainted. Defendant's photographs of police officers allegedly participating in a cover-up were inadmissible because they were cumulative of defendant's other photographs admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant's husband was injured at work, and a claim was allowed for a cerebral hemorrhage with left-sided paralysis resulting from the injury. Compensation was paid to the claimant's husband until the time of his death. The claimant alleged that the death of her husband resulted from the same injury for which he had been receiving compensation. The claimant argued that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.59(2) provided that death benefits were to be paid if an injury sustained by an employee caused his death and if compensation for total or partial disability on account of the injury which caused his death had been paid for any portion of the year next preceding the date of death. The administrator argued that the language concerning partial disability was stricken from the statute by binding case law. The court reversed the judgment, holding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4123.59(2) provided that death benefits shall be paid if compensation for partial disability were paid for any portion of the year next preceding the date of death of such employee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants filed a declaratory judgment and injunction action seeking to prevent appellee from using his property for funeral home purposes. Appellants contended appellee's plan to construct the funeral home was in direct violation of the deed restriction and argued that such restrictions were valid and enforceable. Appellants contended that the ordinance rezoning appellee's property was unconstitutional and void as spot zoning and was arbitrary and had no substantial relation to public health, safety, morals or the general welfare. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment for appellee and concluded that the original use restriction on the property had not been preserved and was extinguished under the Ohio Marketable Title Act. The court ruled the restriction was extinguished because the use restriction in existence prior to the root of title was not specifically stated or identified in the root of title or in the chain of record title and was not recorded within 40 years after the root of the title. The court also found a substantial change in the character of the neighborhood so as to nullify the deed restrictions limiting the use of the property for residential uses only.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Defendant knew that there was only one plate and told the officer that the vehicle had been damaged in an automobile accident and that the plate was lost at that time. The officer who conducted the investigation of the accident told defendant's daughter that she did not need to do anything about the plate because the police authority would contact the bureau of motor vehicles to send a new one. Defendant was convicted of driving a vehicle without a front license plate. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that it was not necessary to have an element of intent in Columbus, Ohio, Codified Ordinance 2315.09(a) or in its equivalent Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4503.21. The court held that defendant had an absolute duty to perform certain actions under the statute. A violation constituted a criminal act in and of itself, so neither intent, nor negligence was an element in the criminal prosecution of the offense. The court held that the strict enforcement of traffic laws was justified by the broad public interest in maintaining an adequate system of registering and identifying motor vehicles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio), which sentenced him to imprisonment in the penitentiary for the term provided by law. He was found guilty by a jury of two counts of wounding a guard in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2901.11. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to dismiss based on the double jeopardy provisions of the Ohio and U.S. Constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's motion to dismiss prior to trial asserted that his constitutional right to due process had been violated because he had twice been placed in jeopardy for the same offense where he had already been tried, found guilty, and punished by the Ohio State Penitentiary Rules Infraction Board. Defendant was then imprisoned for an indefinite sentence of 30 days to one year. The court found that if, as contended by defendant, the prison punishment involved constituted double punishment for the same offense, it was the prison punishment, not the punishment provided by law that was invalid and unconstitutional. However, defendant did not challenge the prison punishment. Moreover, because a person could commit more than one offense by a single act, and because the record was not clear as to the precise violation of penitentiary rules for which defendant was punished, it could have well been that defendant was punished for a violation of a prison rule that did not constitute the offense of wounding a guard for which he was tried and convicted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Each defendant was part of a scheme concocted by a lawyer under which he convinced people to give him short-term loans.

Defendants, as well as up to 65 other people, assisted in the scheme by selling notes, signed by the lawyer, to various people. Only 14 of the people involved in the selling of notes were indicted under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1707.44. Defendants were chosen to be part of the group that was indicted after the state division of securities placed each of the 65 note sellers into different categories. The categories were based on the number of notes sold by each person. Defendants asserted that the selective enforcement of &sect; 1707.44 violated their equal protection rights. The court affirmed the convictions. The securities division had broad powers to initiate or not initiate criminal proceedings. To show an equal protection violation, defendants were required the existence of intentional or purposeful discrimination, which was based on some unjustifiable standard such as race or religion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee was indicted and charged with four counts of sale of security without a license and four counts of sale of unregistered security.

On appeal the court did not find prejudicial error in the trial court's permitting appellee to change his plea before the trial was begun. However, in regarding the remaining assignments of error jointly, the court determined that there were errors as to those judgments, as it found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1707.23 was not arbitrary and unreasonable. Nor was discriminatory enforcement of Ohio Rev. Code Chapter 1707 found. Section 1707.23 fixed guidelines and rules to follow in the enforcement of the securities law to prevent fraud in the sale of securities and was a valid exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

He challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 2327.01, claimed that he did not utter obscene or fighting words, and assigned error to jury instructions defining obscene or profane language. He claimed the verdict was against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The charging affidavit alleged that defendant unlawfully blocked street traffic and used improper and obscene language, and the prosecution's sole witness was an officer who saw defendant at an anti-war demonstration on a university campus. He stated that he saw defendant and two others using cans of paint to spray obscenities on a bank building and later saw defendant participating in chants that included obscene words. Defendant claimed he was not in the locations where the officer said he was seen. He did not object to the trial court's jury instruction on obscene or profane language at trial, though he claimed the instruction was unconstitutional on appeal. The court found that &sect; 2327.01 imposed a very definite standard, rejected defendant's constitutional challenge on vagueness grounds, and held that the right of free speech did not include the right to spray words on a building or to shout obscene and profane words in a busy urban area. The court held that obscene or profane words were unprotected and punishable, that defendant could not complain about instructions to which he never objected, and that the trial court made no prejudicial error in its instructions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the trainer's appeal from the commission's order.

The court further held that the lack of evidence concerning the trainer's guilty knowledge of the prohibited substance did not render the application of the insurer rule, Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The governor, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;125.09, reduced the payments to the school district by three percent for two months and the board brought an action alleging that the action was invalid and void. The lower court granted the governor summary judgment, and the court reversed. The court found that given the emergency financial problems, it was not unconstitutional for the legislature to place limited discretion on the governor because insolvency of the state affected the general welfare and could endanger public morals, health, and safety. The court determined that the only safeguard of the public in an emergency situation where the governor needed unrestricted power was the integrity of the governor in making his decisions. The court concluded that &sect;125.09 was not applicable to payment made pursuant to chapter 3317 of the Code and therefore the legislature did not intend to include the amounts in question under &sect; 3317.01. The court held that because &sect; 125.09 did not apply to chapter 3317, the amount withheld should have been restored to the school district.</SPAN></P>

Subsequently, the massage therapist filed an action for declaratory judgment against the state medical board concerning the allegation of practicing chiropractic medicine without a license. The trial court denied the board's motion to dismiss the declaratory judgment action. On appeal, the board argued that such denial was error. The massage therapist countered with arguments that challenged the validity of the medical practices act, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4731.15 - 4731.21, upon which he had been charged. The court held that the board was entitled to dismissal of the declaratory judgment action because there was no justiciable issue before the trial court.

Because the trial court did not base its decision on the basis that the utterances were obscene or profane, the court held that the error was not prejudicial to defendant. The court found that the opprobrious words and abusive language constituted fighting words. The court held that because the affidavit alleged the use of obscene and profane language, the language was constitutionally unprotected. The court held that defendant's presence in the street for approximately one hour aiding the obstruction of the flow of traffic was disorderly conduct within the meaning of the ordinance. The court held that the ordinance was not so vague and overbroad that it violated, on its face, the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States because the ordinance could have been overly broad only if it permitted or authorized the punishment of constitutionally protected conduct, which it did not.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, for a second time, reversed the order of the zoning board, but the court reversed the trial court. The court found that the trial court was incorrect in its determination that there was a nonconforming use. The court noted that the trial court was required to only consider such evidence as existed in the transcript from the zoning board pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.03 because there had been no deficiencies shown in the transcript. The transcript of the zoning board did not show that there was any evidence presented that the property had been used as a four-family structure prior to the enactment of the zoning code. The only permit that had ever been issued by the city was for the operation of the building as a two-family structure, and no permit had ever been issued to remodel the building into a four-family structure.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 1.17, defendant aided and abetted in the victim's murder. Where there was a criminal conspiracy, the prosecution did not have to prove that the aider and abettor possessed those individual elements that were needed to establish the crime against the perpetrator. Defendant was criminally responsible for any act that was done in the furtherance of a common criminal enterprise, whether intended by him or not, if the act was likely to result from the intended crime. Defendant's equal protection rights were not violated when one of the accomplices was granted immunity to testify against defendant because the prosecution was allowed to exercise discretion in deciding who was to be prosecuted as long as the decision did not deliberately discriminate between persons in similar circumstances based on an unjustifiable standards.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court held that the penalty section of &sect; 2901.11 was not ambiguous and that the standards were quite definite as guidelines for the exercise of judicial discretion. The court also held that &sect; 2901.11 was not repugnant to the equal protection clause because the statute applied equally to all in the category described therein and did not provide different restrictions or privileges to anyone for the offense involved. Finally, the court held that double jeopardy, in a constitutional context, meant that no person could be twice placed in jeopardy of conviction and punishment as a criminal defendant by indictment and trial. Noting that there was a difference between administrative prison authority penalties and judicial jurisdiction, including the penalties they could impose, the court held that double jeopardy did not include administrative procedures or penalties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner obtained a permit to build a dwelling on a lot. However, when it was discovered that another dwelling extended onto the lot, the permit was revoked because the zoning regulations did not allow more than one dwelling to a lot.

After the board denied the variance and the trial court affirmed, the owner sought review, claiming that the board had acted unreasonably and that the limitation on the property's use constituted a taking. After noting that the trial court had used the standards set forth in Ohio Rev.

In rejecting the owner's claim of a taking, the court held that the zoning regulations, which had been enacted pursuant to the police power and which were sufficiently reasonable to outweigh whatever losses the owner had suffered, did not constitute a &quot;taking of private property.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant pleaded guilty to the charges of pocket picking. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Defendant's plea was voluntarily and intelligently made because substance rather than form controlled in determining whether a guilty plea was voluntarily made when the trial court accepted the plea. The record did not have to contain detailed waivers of all of the constitutional rights that were forfeited by a plea of guilty. The trial court properly overruled defendant's motion for a credit on his sentence for the time that he spent in jail prior to the imposition of the sentence. Even though incarceration time that was served prior to a conviction was required to be credited against a subsequently imposed sentence, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2967.191 provided that only the parole authority had the power to credit defendant's sentence. Only if the parole authorities failed to comply with &sect; 2967.191 would defendant have been justified in seeking extraordinary relief from the courts.</SPAN></P>

There was nothing in the record that would permit the Director's retention of provisional employees and the laying off of the employee, who was a permanent certified employee. Proper application of the Administrative Rules of the Director of State Personnel, PL-31-01, did not permit the retention of the provisional employees, regardless of their technical classification, and the laying off of the employee.

Code Ann. &sect; 322.02. The property owners sought review of a decision of a trial court (Ohio), which held that with the exception of the words &quot;at least 12 months&quot; contained in Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 322.01(A), Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 322.01 to 322.99 were valid and constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners contended that the statute violated equal protection because of the difference in tax depending on whether the buyer assumed the mortgage or took a new mortgage. The court held that the distinction was reasonable considering the purpose of the tax. An exemption for real estate sales where the value of the real property did not exceed $ 100 also had a practical and reasonable basis. The court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 322.02 was a general law that authorized every county in the state to levy a real estate transfer tax and that it did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 26. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 322.02 was an excise tax that came under Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 10. Thus, Ohio Const. art. XII, &sect; 2 was inapplicable. The express language &quot;laws providing for tax levies&quot; in Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1d was limited to an actual self-executing levy of taxes and was not synonymous with laws &quot;relating&quot; to tax levies or &quot;pertaining&quot; to tax levies, or &quot;concerning&quot; tax levies, or any agency or method provided for a tax levy of any local subdivision or authority. Thus, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 322.02 did not violate Ohio Const. art. II, &sect; 1d.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff property owners appealed from the Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning County (Ohio), which found for defendant Municipality of Canfield, Ohio, in a case seeking a declaratory judgment challenging the constitutionality of Canfield, Ohio, Zoning Ordinance &sect; 1127.02. The property owners filed the action following the refusal to rezone the property owners' land from a highway service district to multiple family residential.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners were denied a zoning change to multiple family residential use. They first claimed that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional because it was unrelated to public health, safety, morals, and general welfare. The court disagreed, holding that separating various portions of the municipality for particular uses did have a relation to public health, safety, and general welfare. The property owners also claimed that the zoning ordinance was confiscatory and amounted to taking property without compensation and without due process. In support of this position, the property owners had put on evidence to establish that the highest and best use of the property was multiple family residential use. The court again disagreed, holding that zoning ordinances were presumed to be constitutional and that the challenger had the burden of proving they were unreasonable or arbitrary. The fact that the ordinance prohibited the most economically advantageous use did not prove that the ordinance was unreasonable or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment upholding the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jury returned a verdict which found defendant guilty of the reckless operation of a motor vehicle. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 conferred on municipalities the power to adopt regulations in the exercise of the local police power as long as the regulations did not conflict with the general laws. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.06 of the Uniform Traffic Law provided that its provisions were to uniform throughout Ohio and no local authority was allowed to enact any regulation that was in conflict. A discrepancy existed between the reckless driving penalty that was provided for in the ordinance and the statutory penalty. The court determined that the ordinance was not in conflict of the general laws of Ohio. The municipal court's statement during the sentencing that it felt that the defendant did not present the true facts in the case because of the municipal court's personal knowledge was improper, but it could not have influenced the jury when it was made during defendant's sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The police chief perfected an appeal pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 143.27 to the commission, which conducted a hearing and affirmed the order of discharge. The police chief filed a notice of appeal to the trial court. The city filed a motion requiring the police chief to post additional security for his appeal.

The court determined that the filing of the notice of appeal was the only jurisdictional step in perfecting a law and fact appeal. No motion to dismiss the appeal on law and fact was entered at any stage in the common pleas court, therefore, the city waived any right to question appealability on law and fact by reason of the lack of an appeal bond. The court determined that Ohio Rev.

Defendant could not profit from his own wrong in order to obtain reversal. While a statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev.

Further, the statute related to situations were a defendant fled after the jury was sworn. The State did not improperly refer to defendant's failure to testify in closing, rather the State simply stated the basic fact that defendant fled the jurisdiction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1945, the city issued a permit for an apartment building of 98 suites and 85 parking spaces. Before the original construction was finished, alterations resulted in the creation of 101 suites and 19 rooms. The permit issued for the original construction did not conform to existing zoning limits, and the alterations were made without a permit. Many years later, the owner applied to the zoning board for a variance. Deeming the variance allowed insufficient, the owner appealed. The trial court affirmed. On further appeal, the court affirmed. When the initial permit was issued, the building was prohibited by then-current zoning ordinances that called for more garage space. The permit could not legalize beyond the ordinance, and it was thus a nullity. The fault was compounded when alterations increased the number of suites and rooms without parking additions. Construction not made in conformity with zoning regulations could not achieve the status of a pre-existent non-conforming use and needed to be validated, if at all, by a variance. The trial court properly affirmed the board's conclusions that the variance allowed conformed to the legal standards the board was authorized to apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Akron Board of Zoning Appeals challenged a judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Summit County (Ohio), which reversed the Board's decision not to grant a variance to appellee church to build a church building. The church wanted to build the church on appellee landowner's property, which was located in a single family residence zone. A city planning commission had approved the church's building plans prior to the Board's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The church was denied a building permit after the Board denied its application to construct a church building on the landowner's property. Upon review, the trial court found that the record failed to show that the proposed church would seriously injure the appropriate use of the neighboring property. The trial court ordered the Board to grant the requested variance, subject to the conditions recommended by the planning commission. The Board appealed and asserted that the trial court lacked the authority to order it to issue a variance and erred in refusing to allow Board members to testify in the appeal. In affirming, the court held that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2506.04 authorized the trial court to remand the cause to the body appealed from, with instructions to enter the order requested. The trial court had properly examined the record and had determined no substantial evidence supported the Board's order. The Board's order, therefore, constituted a reversible abuse of discretion under &sect; 2506.04. Members of the Board could have stated their reasons for denying the variance in the Board's record, but could not be called and examined as to their mental processes in the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's pre-trial motion to dismiss was properly denied where defendant failed to request a bill of particulars and waived any objections to the indictment by going to trial on the affidavit contained in the indictment. The court found that &sect; 2921.05 was not unconstitutionally vague where the statute sufficiently provided what could constitute a violation of it. The court determined that the wearing of a flag on the seat of one's pants was a physical act that defiled the flag in violation of &sect; 2921.05. The court concluded that such a use of the flag would degrade and cheapen it in the eyes of the people, as well as defeated the object of maintaining it as an emblem of national power and honor. The court reasoned that defendant chose to wear the flag in the one place that showed the most contempt, the most defilement, and the place which most debased and dishonored the flag.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The disputed land was zoned for single-family residential use. The prospective buyer alleged that the land's extremely uneven topography made that use unfeasible and that the city's refusal to rezone it constituted a confiscation of the property. The trial court held that the land's topography meant that not all of it could be developed into lots meeting the size restrictions of the class and that the ordinance was therefore unreasonable and contrary to law. The court reversed the judgment. The incidental loss of value in a piece of property was not sufficient to invalidate a zoning ordinance, as long as the regulation was reasonably related to health, safety, and general welfare. The prospective buyer did not show that his land was treated differently from other land in the community, nor did he show that a less highly concentrated development on the property was not economically feasible. Evidence that the land's soil was unstable, that it was subject to landslides, flooding, and fog, and that roads would have been difficult to construct supported the relationship between the land's zoning and the protection of public health, safety, and general welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court judgment that had granted declaratory relief to the prospective buyer of the disputed land and had held that the city's zoning ordinances were unconstitutional as applied to the parcels of land on which the prospective buyer held options to purchase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The juvenile was charged with being in a public place at during the hours when he was required to be in school. The trial court denied the juvenile's motion to have the ordinance declared to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the juvenile argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional, claiming the city lacked the authority legislate in the area of compulsory school attendance because it was in conflict with state law. The court affirmed the conviction, and refused to find the ordinance unconstitutional, holding that it in no sense conflicted with any general law passed by the state legislature. The court considered whether the ordinance, as measured by the city's police power, was an unreasonable, arbitrary, and oppressive exercise of the police power, and whether it was reasonably designed to accomplish the purpose falling within the scope of the police power. The challenged ordinance made absence from school and presence on the street a misdemeanor and was no more unreasonable or arbitrary than the compulsory attendance laws it supplemented. The court held that the general welfare, if not the public safety and morals, was enhanced by the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sewed a patch to cover a hole in the seat of his pants that extended to his crotch area. He made the patch a representation of the American flag to be stylish. He had no intention of offending anyone or of making a political statement. Defendant claimed that &sect; 2921.05&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated his freedom of speech rights. The court held that the conviction was proper. The court reasoned that only pure speech was to be protected and not symbolic speech. Because defendant's act did not involve pure speech, his act of wearing the flag was conduct and was not protected by the First Amendment. Though wearing the flag was not one of the prohibited acts stated in &sect; 2921.05, wearing the flag over his crotch was a sign of contempt and disrespect that constituted defacement and defiling of the flag, which was a similar act to the prohibited acts listed in &sect; 2921.05. Although the patch was not the flag, it represented the flag. Defendant could have used other styles to cover his hole. The need to protect the flag was important to lower any incidence of disorderly conduct caused by public outrage. Defendant's act was contemptuous, despite his lack of intent to be contemptuous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant individual challenged a judgment from the Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) denying his request for a declaratory and injunctive relief and upholding the validity of Cleveland, Ohio, City Charter amends. &sect;&sect; 198-1, 198-2. The amendments allowed the police and fire departments' compensation of appellee City of Cleveland, Ohio, to be three percent higher than any other municipality in the State of Ohio given a certain population size.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 198-1, dealing with the annual pay rate for firemen, was placed on the ballot by initiative petition. Section 198-2, regarding police compensation, was submitted to the electorate by the City council's enactment of Cleveland, Ohio, Ordinance No. 547-68. The court upheld the trial court's judgment after finding nothing in the Ohio Constitution to establish that the charter amendments were an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The City could properly make a law to delegate a power to ascertain a fact upon which that law was to depend. The City's citizens, through their charter, chose the way in which their police and firemen would be paid. Thus, having determined the fundamental issue, they delegated nothing. The City council, in implementing the amendments, had standards to use in determining the wages. They looked to other cities of similar magnitude to obtain statistical data. Because the formula used was precise, the amendments contained essential safeguards to protect against arbitrary actions by those assigned to compute the wages. The court also noted that analogous law existed where data was similarly obtained and used to establish wages.</SPAN></P>

There was no bill of exceptions or transcript of proceedings either in verbatim or narrative form. The court reversed defendant's conviction. The court held that under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution, defendant, even though it was a misdemeanor case, was entitled to be advised by the trial court of his rights and privileges, including the privilege against self-incrimination, right to trial by jury in all but petty crimes, right to be informed of the nature of the charge against him, right to confront witnesses against him, and the right to the assistance of counsel for his defense.

The employee refused to trim his hair and he was suspended from his employment. The personnel board of review upheld the order and the employee appealed, arguing that the administrative order was a violation of his personal freedom. The court ruled that the right to wear one's hair at any length or in any desired manner was an ingredient of personal freedom protected by the First Amendment and such protection was applicable to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Further, the court held that in determining whether regulations concerning the style and length of hair and manner of dress were lawful and reasonable each case must be decided in its own particular setting and factual background and within the context of the entire record before the court. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that unless there was specifically shown to be an expression of philosophy, idealism, or point of view through a style of one's hair no protection under the First Amendment could successfully be claimed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was walking down a city street wearing a Unites States flag that was folded and tied into a knapsack. He stopped at a public square, spread the flag out on the ground, and placed his personal property on top of the flag for display. Defendant was convicted of violating the provision of &sect; 2921.05 prohibiting any person from publicly defiling, defacing, trampling upon, or otherwise casting contempt upon the Ohio or United States flags. On appeal, defendant raised several claims. The court rejected each claim, and affirmed the conviction. Contrary to defendant's contention, the court found that subjecting the flag to pollution, desecration, and tarnishment by spreading it on the ground and placing personal items on it for display did not constitute constitutionally protected freedom of expression. The court also held that &sect; 2921.05 was not unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, or overbroad because the words &quot;or otherwise cast contempt&quot; had a clearly defined meaning. In addition, the court held that the lower court properly rejected defendant's motion to dismiss because there was sufficient evidence that defendant defiled the flag.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2933.21 as property used as a means for the commission of a crime and as obscene materials involved in a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.35. The court concluded that the arrest of defendant and the seizure of the motion picture films as evidence did not violate any constitutional right of defendant under either the First, Fourth, or Fifteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, or under the Ohio Constitution. The court found that defendant was engaged in the commercial exploitation of obscenity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant administrator sought review of the judgment of the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas (Ohio) that was entered for defendant State of Ohio on sovereign immunity grounds in a wrongful death action alleging that the negligence of state employees caused the death of the administrator's decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The administrator sued the state, claiming that his decedent was killed due to the negligence of state employees. The state moved to quash, arguing that it had not consented to be sued and it was therefore protected by sovereign immunity. The motion was sustained and judgment entered for the state. The administrator appealed, arguing that the action was not barred by sovereign immunity and any immunity violated equal protection. In reversing, the appellate court agreed that sovereign immunity did not apply. Notwithstanding precedent suggesting the contrary, under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 16 (1912), suits could be brought against the state and, from such statutes as Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 2305.01 and 2307.01, it was adducible that the state had waived any immunity that otherwise existed. Moreover, the notion of government immunity where private persons remained liable contravened elemental notions of due process and equal protection. Where negligence was the proximate cause of the injury, the rule was liability and immunity the exception.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment for the state was reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed with the State's argument that exigent circumstances excused compliance with Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2935.12, which required announcement of purpose and identity. The conduct of defendants did not warrant the conclusion that the officers held a reasonable belief they were in danger of bodily harm or that defendants were trying to escape or destroy evidence. The search warrant was unlawfully executed and evidence seized as a result of the search should have been suppressed. The affidavit in support of the search warrant was not defective. A sketch of the first floor showing some furniture and the location of the narcotics contained in an affidavit for the search warrant was a reason in support of the informant's conclusion and explained why his information was reliable.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court ruled that the entrapment defense was not available to defendant because the blackmail scheme originated with him and his cohort and the police were only observers when the criminal act was committed. Defendant also argued that the trial judge erred when he instructed the jury by reading the definition of reasonable doubt set forth in Ohio Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a theatre manager, a theatre operator, and a distribution company, challenged a decision from the trial court (Ohio), which because of appellee State's complaint, permanently enjoined them and all persons acting for them from exhibiting the film. Appellants filed an appeal bond to perfect their appeal and also to stay the execution of the trial court's injunction until a final adjudication was made in the State appellate courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State filed a complaint for an injunction to enjoin the exhibition of a film, which it deemed to be obscene, and to abate the film as a public nuisance. On appeal, the court sought to determine whether the film in question was obscene, and therefore, subject to the provisions of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 3767.01 et seq. The court viewed the film and determined that the film was obscene. To the average person applying national contemporary community standards the dominant theme of the film, taken as a whole, appealed to a prurient interest in sex, that the film went substantially beyond customary limits of candor and affronted contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters. Moreover appellants were pandering. The advertising and promotional materials were slanted to appeal to the erotic interests of their customers. Because the film was obscene, a nuisance as defined in &sect; 3767.01 was maintained, and the applicable provisions of that section were invoked and were mandatory. The court ordered that the theatre close for one year and an accounting of the box office receipts arising out of the exhibition of the film.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the permanent injunction and ordered the theatre to close for one year from the date of entry that was filed by the court. A tax of $ 300 was imposed on defendants and against the real property where the theatre was located. The box office receipts were to be paid to the county treasurer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city officials appealed from the judgment of the Common Pleas Court of Franklin County, Ohio, which permanently enjoined them from charging or collecting sewer rates imposed by ordinance and enjoined them from imposing a freeze on the issuance of building and sewer permits. The city officials alleged that plaintiff taxpayer lacked standing, that the judgment was contrary to law, and that the trial court improperly allowed intervention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer did not live in the city but worked in the city and paid city income taxes. The court held that he had standing to bring a taxpayer action challenging the ordinance. The city council passed the ordinance setting sewer rates as an emergency measure. The city charter provided that no measure regulating the rate charged by a public utility could be passed as an emergency measure. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4905.02, which defined &quot;public utility,&quot; excluded from its definition any municipally owned utility. The court further drew a distinction between the city's fixing the rates charged by city owned utilities and regulating the rates charged by other utilities. The court held the ordinance was valid. The trial court had permitted the homebuilder to intervene as a plaintiff to assert a claim that it had a right to issuance of building and sewer permits. The court held that the determination of an applicant's right to a permit was based upon the individual situation of each application and not a proper subject for a class action. The court held that the trial court erred in allowing intervention by the homebuilder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The real estate was located on the corner of a major intersection near a shopping mall. The oil company was going to purchase real estate from the property owners in order to build a gas station. The real estate was zoned residential. The property owners sought a zoning reclassification to permit them to use the property for commercial purposes. The city council rejected the petition for rezoning. The city council denied the application to build the gas station. The lower court affirmed the denial. The oil company and the property owners sought review. On review, the court held that the denial was unconstitutional. The court noted that the continuation of residential restrictions on the property owners' property would result in a deprivation of the welfare and safety of the property owners due to noxious fumes, dust and noise associated with traffic congestion. The court concluded that the only reasonable use to which the property could be put was commercial. The court noted that the changed characteristics of the area made it impossible for the property owners to enjoy their property while zoned under a residential classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company sold used cars by matching up prospective buyers with persons who wished to sell their cars. The company never took title to any of the cars. The State informed the company that it had no right to continue its business, pursuant to statute. The company brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment as to the validity of the statute, and requested that it be declared unconstitutional and invalid, or in the alternative, that it be declared not to apply to the company. The trial court denied the requested relief, and the court upheld the findings. The court held that the clear intent of the legislature in enacting the statute was to prevent fraud upon the public in the sale of motor vehicles. Further, the court held that the language of the statute was broad enough to encompass the business of the company. The court also agreed that the statute was constitutional because it was in keeping with reasonably sound public policy to require commercial enterprises to have title to automobiles with which they were dealing in a sales capacity in order that they could be required to stand behind any representations made by them during the course of a sales transaction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 70.27 was identical with the drag racing section of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.251, excepting that the penalties that could be imposed vary widely. Defendants contended that the ordinance violated Ohio Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 3 in that it was in conflict with the general statutory law providing for penalties for drag racing. The court noted that it had held in a number of cases that, where municipal ordinances were analogous to state statutes in all except punishment, or were analogous except as to the omission of one element of an offense, the differences did not amount to a conflict with the general law of Ohio. The court determined, however, that there was a legislative intention that not only the acts prohibited, under Ohio Rev. Code Ann. chapter 4511, but also the potential penalty, which could be imposed for committing them, could be the same whether under ordinance or statute. The court ruled that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.06 specifically required that all penalties pertaining to the violation of traffic laws relating to the operation of motor vehicles were to be uniform.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employers alleged in their declaratory judgment action that Ohio Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 4107.42, 4107.43, 4107.46, and other provisions that regulated work conditions for female employees, were inconsistent with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and were therefore invalid. The trial court declared the provisions to be invalid and permanently enjoined appellants from enforcing the statutory provisions. Upon review, the court reversed the judgment and dissolved the injunction. The court held that the statutes were not invalid on their faces, that they were constitutional and valid enactments that constituted a constitutionally valid classification of employees, and that the provisions did not deny the equal protection of the law to any employee. The court found that the provisions constituted a legislative determination that gender was a bona fide occupational qualification that was reasonably necessary in the normal operation of a particular business or enterprise requiring the frequent or repeated lifting of weights over 25 pounds. The court stated that no evidence was offered to show that such legislative determination was unreasonable or factually unsound.</SPAN></P>

The court held that when the evidence in a criminal case tended to sustain all the essential elements charged in the indictment, it was error for the trial court to withdraw the case from the jury and discharge defendant. The trial court on a motion of the prosecution ordered defendant to submit to the extraction of a blood sample by the county physician in a hospital. A hearing was had thereon with defendant and counsel present and it was ordered that either counsel could be present at the taking of the blood sample. Thus, more safeguards were given defendant than in the issuance of an ordinary search warrant. He was present with counsel and could voice his objections which he did.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of his conviction in a court of common pleas, division of domestic relations (Ohio) of violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.42 for failing to support his minor child. Defendant claimed Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.99, the penalty section relating to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.42, was unconstitutional and that he was denied equal protection under the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.99 was unconstitutional in that it provided for imprisonment for failure to pay a debt in contravention of Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 15, and that &sect; 2151.99 and Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.42 denied him equal protection under the law in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court affirmed the judgment. A claim for support money was not a debt within the constitutional guaranty against imprisonment for debt. The duty to support a child was an obligation owing by the parent to the public and was not dischargeable. It was reasonable for the state to provide for measures, which exacted penalties and sanctions for those who did not meet the attendant responsibilities of a parent to support his child. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.99 was not unconstitutional and did not conflict with the prohibition of imprisonment for debt. The state need not prove the ability of defendant to support a child, but that issue could be raised by way of affirmative defense. Because evidence of the inability to support would be a proper defense in an action brought pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2151.42, no equal protection violation was present.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Athens County Municipal Court (Ohio). The jury found defendant guilty of the misdemeanor offense of indecent exposure, a violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.30.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the presence of people of mixed ages and gender, defendant went swimming in the nude at a private reservoir. Deputy sheriffs, without a search warrant and without the reservoir owner's permission, observed defendant and arrested him without a warrant. The court held that defendant wilfully committed indecent exposure where there were other persons to be offended and annoyed thereby. The court found the search reasonable because defendant exposed himself and the reservoir was not adjacent to a house or residence or part of a curtilage. Consequently, defendant had no cause to complain concerning the lack of a search warrant. The court found that the sheriffs possessed the legal authority to arrest defendant for a misdemeanor committed in their presence. The court ruled that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2941.05 authorized charging the offense in the words of the statute,&nbsp;Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 2905.30. The court concluded that the statute was constitutional because the words &quot;indecent exposure&quot; in &sect; 2905.30 were not vague and indefinite. The court decided that those words had a well defined, well understood, and accepted meaning, and by their use an accused would be informed of the act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the state level, defendants were indicted for robbery of a financial institution, which was identical to the charges earlier disposed at the federal level. Defendants contended that the state indictments were barred by the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court found that the successive indictment was barred under the double jeopardy clause, holding that: (1) The double jeopardy stricture of the Fifth Amendment applied to the states through the providence of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) it was incompatible with fundamental justice that person who had been charged with a crime, be exposed to jeopardy for the same act first in the federal system and then a second time in the courts of the state; (3) for double jeopardy purposes, it was irrelevant whether the second jeopardy followed an acquittal, a plea of guilty, or a conviction; and (4) the evils prohibited by the state's double jeopardy clause under Ohio Const. art. I, &sect; 10 was not precluded merely because the state and federal sovereignties combined to generate them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed a petition in the Municipal Court of Miamisburg (Ohio) pursuant to Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191(F) to avoid the suspension, by defendant, the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, of his license to drive for refusing to take a chemical test for alcohol. The trial court found that the plaintiff was not advised of this right, but ordered his license suspended for failure to comply with the statute. Plaintiff appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The petition alleged that the arresting officer failed to properly advise him pursuant to statute of his right to have a physician, technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of his own choosing administer an addition chemical test or tests. The prosecuting attorney conceded that the result of a test, conducted without the accused person being advised of his right to an additional test as provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19, would be suppressible in a prosecution for driving while intoxicated, but argued that the requirement was not applicable in the matter of the registrar's revocation of the accused's license. The court disagreed. The court found that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4511.19 and 4511.191 were in pari materia where the right to be advised as provided by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.19 was stated in absolute terms and could not be taken away by Ohio Rev. Code Ann. &sect; 4511.191. The court found that the revocation of a license was the imposition of a penalty, without the requirement of a conviction in court, and that the double standard contended for by the registrar would have given him wider power than the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer sought review of an order from the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals upholding appellee Tax Commissioner's assessments and penalties against the taxpayer. The Commissioner filed a motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commissioner contended that the taxpayer's notice of appeal did not sufficiently set forth the errors complained of to invoke the jurisdiction of the court. The notice of appeal alleged that the Board's final order was unreasonable, unlawful, and against the manifest weight of the evidence. It also alleged that the Commissioner's evidence was so manifestly in error that the Board's decision amounted to an unconstitutional taking of the taxpayer's property under both the Ohio and federal Constitutions. The court refused to dismiss the appeal. First, it was highly persuasive that federal courts had held that the states could place practically no limitations upon a citizen's right to a judicial review of his federal claim of an unconstitutional deprivation of his liberty by a state court. Second, statutes providing for appeals and for proceedings with respect to appeals were remedial in nature and should be given a liberal interpretation in favor of a right of appeal. Here, the taxpayer stated its complaint well within the limits the government could constitutionally place upon independent judicial review of bureaucratic seizure of private property.</SPAN></P>
