</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A neighborhood association and landowners objected to the construction of homes on nearby vacant land. They brought an action under the MEPA, and the trial court granted an injunction barring such development. The developer appealed and the court reversed. The court held that although the natural resources on the land were the type subject to the MEPA, the developer's proposed construction did not rise to the level proscribed by statute and Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 52. The court held that the proper standard to be used was a balancing of the rarity of the resources against the magnitude of the harm likely to result. Because the plant and animal life was not rare or unique, the land was only marginally suitable for their purposes, and there were many other locations better suited, the court held that the MEPA did not apply.</SPAN></P>

Comp. Laws &sect; 750.110, and of assault with the intent to commit criminal sexual conduct in the second degree, in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520g(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke into the victim's apartment and attempted to perform a sex act on her. A struggle commenced, and when the victim began screaming for her roommate, defendant told her to shut up or he would kill her. The roommate awoke and succeeded in helping the victim fight off defendant, who fled from the apartment. The victim testified that she had no physical injuries but was sore and had been very scared. Defendant was convicted as charged. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to instruct the jury that the personal injury element of second-degree criminal sexual conduct required more than just evidence of injury that necessarily occurred in any sexual assault. The court rejected that argument and affirmed the conviction, holding that there was sufficient evidence produced during the trial to support a conclusion that defendant intended to inflict bodily injury at the time of the breaking and entering and of the assault. The court determined that the sentence imposed by the trial court exceeded that permitted by statute, so it remanded the cause for resentencing on the assault charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers owned property in villages within townships. The townships levied property taxes as to all properties within its borders at more than five mills. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 42.27 provided that no townships could not tax property located within the limits of a village at a rate in excess of one mill nor could it tax other property within its borders at a rate in excess of five mills. The taxpayers sought a declaratory judgment that certain taxes levied by the townships were illegal under &sect; 42.27. The trial court granted the townships' summary judgment motion, concluding that &sect; 42.27 was unconstitutional in part under the uniformity clause of the Michigan Constitution, Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 3. The trial court held that the uniformity clause did not permit the legislature to require a township to tax property within its borders at different rates. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the uniformity clause did not prevent the legislature from establishing reasonable classifications within particular taxing authorities where the purpose and effect of such classifications was the promotion of a more equitable distribution of the tax burden.</SPAN></P>

The company argued that Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 521.1 (1963) permitted the circuit court to enter a declaratory judgment in an assessment dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county and the township filed petitions with the tribunal seeking a declaratory judgment that the company's interests in the underground formations in which gas was stored be separately assessed from the interests of the surface owners, and that the company's interests in the storage field be assessed as omitted property for the relevant two years. The company filed suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief based upon the petitions. The circuit court granted defendants' motion for accelerated judgment, holding that the tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction to consider the company's claims. On appeal, the court held that: 1) the tribunal had authority to hear the company's constitutional claims; 2) the company's request for equitable relief had not invoked the circuit court's jurisdiction in contravention of the legislature's exclusive grant of jurisdiction to resolve assessment disputes to the tribunal; 3) the matter was clearly a tax assessment dispute, falling squarely within the exclusive jurisdiction of the tribunal; and 4) because circuit courts had no jurisdiction over property tax disputes, they had no power to enter declaratory judgments in such disputes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a county probate juvenile court and a judges' association, brought an action in a Michigan trial court for declaratory relief to determine whether the juvenile court had to comply with regulations promulgated by defendant, the Michigan Department of Social Services, under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.111 et seq. The Department sought review of the trial court's grant of declaratory and injunctive relief in favor of plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department, under &sect; 722.111, enacted rules stating that the probate court's juvenile division was within the definition of a &quot;child placing agency.&quot; Thus, the division had to submit an agency application. The juvenile court refused to comply, arguing that the legislature did not intend for the juvenile court to be included within the child care organizations licensing act of &sect; 722.111. The trial court agreed and found that the department's attempt to categorize the juvenile court as such violated Mich. Const. art. 3, &sect; 2 (1963). The department was restrained from attempting to apply the licensing act to any probate court. On appeal, the court construed the term &quot;child placing agency&quot; under &sect; 722.111 and determined that the judicial branch was not an agency under the definition of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 24.203(2). Further, the probate court was not a &quot;child care organization,&quot; as defined under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 722.111(a), because its principal function was not the receiving of minor children. Therefore, the licensing act was inapplicable to the juvenile court. There was no error in the granting of injunctive relief, pursuant to Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 521.6 (1963).</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the lease was valid and that the year-to-year provision conferred a right of continuing renewal on the church trustees. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) the state was permitted to contracting to lease property to a religious organization for valid consideration; (2) the lease was based on sufficient consideration and was not unconstitutional where the church trustees had to expend monies to establish the camp and the camp provided a service to the state; and (3) the year-to-year provision was a valid perpetual renewal clause where the renewal provision was coupled with the requirement that the land be used as a camp.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers had timely filed annual reports and the Department had accepted the franchise fees as paid. However, the Department subsequently conducted a field audit and found deficiencies. The taxpayers promptly paid the deficiencies but filed a petition for a refund. The tax tribunal, relying on 1978 Mich. Pub. Acts 392, declined to order a refund. On appeal, the court reversed, concluding that there was no rational basis for the classification of two types of taxpayers in 1978 Mich. Pub. Acts 392, which prevented the taxpayers who paid deficiencies after audits from collecting a refund but held taxpayers who refused to pay deficiencies unaccountable. Although the taxpayers were complying with the procedure in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 450.310 by paying the deficiency and then requesting a refund, the classification in 1978 Mich. Pub. Acts. 392 discouraged compliance with the statutory appeal proceedings. Although 1978 Mich. Pub. Acts 392 was passed to cure the administrative defects in the Department's procedures by declaring previous audits, payments received, and refunds valid, it created an impermissible classification in doing so.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the millage allocated to the county was reduced and the millage allocated to the township was reduced, which rendered the township ineligible for state revenue sharing funds under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 141.912. The township petitioned for review of the reduction order, alleging a denial of its constitutional rights of due process and equal protection. The tax tribunal dismissed the action. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the tax tribunal reached the right result for the wrong reason because it did have jurisdiction to decide constitutional questions. However, the reduction provision of 1975 Mich. Pub. Acts 243 did not violate the uniformity of taxation requirement found in Mich. Const. art. 9, &sect; 3 because uniformity did not require that different taxing units, such as the school district and the township, tax at the same millage rate. Local governments were creatures of legislation and had no privileges or immunities under the federal constitution that it could invoke in opposition to the will of its creator.</SPAN></P>

After a hearing, the director revoked the employer's self-insured status and directed it to obtain private insurance. The Workers' Compensation Appeal Board affirmed the order.

The court found that the statute did not unconstitutionally delegate a legislative function to the director by failing to give sufficient guidelines for the exercise of his authority. The court ruled that the standards for revocation were the same as those for an initial grant of self-insured status, which were directed to the employer's ability to make a reasonable showing of solvency and financial ability to pay compensation benefits under the Act and were as precise was possible given the broad purposes of the Act and the various circumstances in which it applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lawsuit arose out of a motor vehicle accident that occurred on May 1, 1974. At that time, an action against the driver was barred by Michigan's guest passenger statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.401 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.2101). The guest statute was declared unconstitutional on September 8, 1975. Plaintiffs filed their complaint on May 17, 1977. The parties agreed that the three year statute of limitations of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5805(8) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.5805(8)) applied to the action. On appeal, the court held that plaintiffs' action was not time-barred because the statute of limitations ran from the date that the guest statute was invalidated. The action was filed more than three years after the accident, but within three years after the date that the guest statute was invalidated. Because the statute of limitations had not run prior to the date of the invalidation of the statute that had prohibited plaintiffs' cause of action, it was equitable to use the date of the statute's invalidation as the date from which the statute began to run.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of armed robbery. He subsequently pled guilty to a supplemental information charging him as a habitual offender. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant's claim that the identification procedure was suggestive was not reviewable because no objection was made in the trial court. The court found that the identification procedure used by the police was not suggestive. The victim identified defendant at the time of the arrest, which was necessary in order for the police to make the arrest. There were exigent circumstances to validate the police's entry into defendant's house without a warrant. Defendant had been armed with a knife and identified by the victim, thus there was sufficient probable cause. Moreover, the police immediately arrested defendant to insure the safety of others. The court vacated the sentence. It found that the trial court should have vacated the sentence on the underlying felony once defendant pled guilty as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sought benefits for a work-related disability after she began to experience continued pain and difficulty performing her duties. A hearing referee determined that the employee failed to sustain her burden of proof with regard to her entitlement to benefits.

On appeal, the employer and the carrier contended that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.859, which authorized abbreviated decisions of the WCAB, violated the state constitution. The court found that the challenged statute explicitly demanded the rendition of findings of fact and conclusions of law in writing, leaving to the WCAB the option of issuing a written opinion or not. The court held that the WCAB's decision, although brief, provided a sufficiently detailed basis to effectively perform its appellate function. The court found that the WCAB's opinion contained a reasonably complete synopsis of the hearing and deposition testimony adduced and the legal standard applied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' motion for accelerated judgment asserted that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the Michigan Tax Tribunal (tax tribunal) had exclusive and original jurisdiction over any proceeding under the property tax laws. The taxpayers contended that the tax tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear appeals based upon equitable actions or containing constitutional questions. The court reversed the order that denied defendants' motion, concluding that the tax tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction over the claims in the instant action. The taxpayers' claims against the validity of the increased assessments, including a challenge to the data used, equalization factor, and inadequate hearing, constituted an attack on the legal validity of the assessments. The court determined that the tax tribunal had equity jurisdiction and that the proper forum for further administrative review was the tax tribunal. The fact that the taxpayers phrased their claim in constitutional terms of discrimination and violation of due process did not change the nature of the claim as a challenge to property tax assessments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The publisher's complaint alleged that it knew the identity of a defendant in two pending cases and some of the details of the alleged offenses. The judge issued the suppression orders pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520k. The publisher argued that the suppression orders were unconstitutional as prior restraints on publication and as violative of the publisher's right of access to criminal trials and to public records. The court found that if &sect; 750.520k were construed as the publisher feared, it would constitute a prior restrain upon a publication and be in violation of the First Amendment. The court noted that the judge did not enforce the suppression order authorized by &sect; 750.520k against persons not party to the proceedings.

The court held that the excluding order did not prevent the publisher from publishing any information in its possession.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was asked to modify its opinion in an earlier case, and to address the authority of the secretary to continue to collect Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA) taxes. The court granted mandamus and stated that two dates had been established in the attempt to encourage the merger of the public transportation systems. If a written merger agreement was reached before November 15, 1980 or if the systems actually had merged by April 16, 1981, the SEMTA tax would have continued. The court held that the authority to levy SEMTA taxes ceased as of April 16, 1981. To have allowed the tax to continue after that date, even though the merger had not occurred, was patently contradictory. The court ordered that the collection of taxes cease immediately; that SEMTA taxes collected after April 15, 1981 be returned to the individuals who paid them; that the costs of the secretary of state and the department of treasury in returning the sums be deducted from the escrow account; and that all SEMTA taxes collected through April 15, 1981 remain in the escrow account until the terms and conditions set forth in the earlier case had been complied with.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that based upon controlling case law, that the statute's prohibition of the possession of a gas-ejecting device was unconstitutionally vague and was overbroad. On appeal, the court found that recently decided case law precedent held that &sect; 750.224 clearly covered gas-ejecting weapons. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for a new trial. The court held that retrial was not barred by the constitutional prohibition of double jeopardy. Double jeopardy did not prevent retrial because defendant voluntarily obtained termination of his first trial on grounds unrelated to his factual guilt or innocence. The court concluded that the overbreadth or vagueness of &sect; 750.224 had nothing to do with defendant's factual guilt or innocence of the crime charged. Finally, defendant's consent to the dismissal was manifested through his counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court held that governmental immunity precluded recovery from the state under Mich. Comp.

Laws &sect; 400.1 et seq. by driving home from work. The victims also could not sue the state because under Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the patient was admitted to the hospital, she signed an arbitration agreement.

In an affidavit, a hospital employee stated that she had explained the agreement, given the patient a copy of it and a brochure explaining it, and advised the patient that her signature was not required, and that if she did sign she had 60 days to revoke the agreement. The patient stated that, contrary to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5042(7) (Mich. Stat. Ann. 27A.5042(7)), no explanation or information was provided, nor did she receive a copy of the agreement, and that she did not understand arbitration. The trial court dismissed the action and issued an order compelling arbitration. On appeal, the court remanded for further proceedings to determine whether or not the patient received an explanatory brochure and a copy of the agreement. The court found that the patient's due process right to a fair hearing was not violated by the Act where one of the arbitrators was a physician, nor was it unconscionable in abrogating the patient's right to access to the courts, but that strict compliance with the statute was required before arbitration could be ordered.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with similar crimes arising out of another similar transaction occurring three days later. Defendant was tried and found guilty.

On remand, the court directed the trial court to clarify whether it had mistakenly considered defendant to have pleaded to the delivery of the larger quantity on the later date.

The steamers travelled between Michigan and Canada. The lower court dismissed the corporation's claim for the recovery of the use taxes. The court affirmed. The court held that the corporation was not exempt under &sect; 1 of the watercraft tonnage tax act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 207.51 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.281). The purpose of the statute was to exempt vessels from general property taxation only. Nothing in the Michigan use or general sales tax acts specifically exempted vessels over 500 tons engaged in foreign commerce from the payment of use or sales taxes. The commerce clause of the United States Constitution did not preclude Michigan from imposing a use tax on fuel, supplies, and other provisions used in the operation of the steamers. The corporation's activities had a substantial nexus to Michigan and were fairly related to the services provided by the state. The corporation was not exempt from the use tax because it was engaged in interstate commerce as well as foreign commerce. There was no violation of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

Since the right of privacy was grounded in the U.S. Const. amend.

On appeal, the court found that assault with intent to commit unarmed robbery was an essential element of the first-degree criminal sexual conduct charge. Where the underlying felony was a required element for conviction of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, separate convictions violated guarantees against double jeopardy. Defendant's contention that the trial court did not properly instruct the jury that criminal sexual conduct required a finding that the penetration had as its purpose sexual gratification. The evidence of similar acts evidence was admissible because it tended to establish both that defendant had a distinctive modus operandi in committing robberies with related sex offenses and that there was no accident or mistake.</SPAN></P>

Upon the administrator filing suit, the physicians brought a motion for accelerated judgment, contending that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because of the failure to revoke the arbitration agreement. The court affirmed. The court found that the arbitration agreement did not constitute an unenforceable contract of adhesion because (1) the act required these agreements to state that execution was not a prerequisite to treatment; and (2) such arbitration agreements might be revoked within a certain period. The court further found the signing of the agreement did constitute an unknowing waiver of constitutional rights because the wife knowingly waived the right to court access; and (2) the required composition of the arbitration panel did not violate due process because the act provided for procedures to reduce the possibility of bias among panel members.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that defendants' arrests and the searches of the house were illegal because they were no exigent circumstances justifying their arrests or the searches. However, the evidence obtained in the two searches was not procured by an exploitation of the illegality of the arrests. Therefore, the evidence was not required to be suppressed as fruit of a poisonous tree. The trial court did not err in failing to dismiss the case, in admitting a weapon into evidence, or in not giving an adequate cautionary instruction on the nature of accomplice testimony.

The forcible entry into defendant's apartment violated his Fourth Amendment rights. However, the error was harmless, in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt. The prosecution used due diligence in attempting to locate the assault victim and that the defense had extensively cross-examined him at the preliminary examination.

The circuit court granted the participants' motion for summary judgment on equal protection grounds and permanently enjoined the department from terminating the participants' day care benefits. On appeal, the court held that because the executive order involved social programs, the participants had the burden of showing that the denial of day care benefits was arbitrary. Because the programs for which the day care funding was continued were monitored as to employment goals of the curricula and as to the time span, while the IET program was not, the participants did not meet their burden.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 450.321; Mich.

Some taxpayers had refused to pay the assessments, but plaintiffs in this case paid the assessments. The remedial statute declared that all previous audits and assessments were valid. Thus, those taxpayers who failed to pay never incurred liability, while those who had been wrongfully forced to pay the assessments received no refunds. The trial court determined that the disparate treatment of the two groups of taxpayers was unconstitutional, and denied plaintiffs equal protection of the law. The court affirmed, holding that the statute was used as a shield to avoid the constitutional right of equal protection for mere administrative convenience. The court held that reversal was not warranted on the basis of failure to consolidate all of the cases between the parties because they did not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence, and reversal would have been a waste of judicial resources.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's furnaces were not used for experimentation, were not used solely for space heating, and had a capacity of more than 1,000 pounds.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Michigan Civil Service Commission (commission) sought review of the decision of the Oakland County Circuit Court (Michigan), which granted plaintiff employees' motion to enjoin the commission from subjecting the employees to further layoffs and ordered the commission to pay the employees for the layoff that had occurred.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission initiated an involuntary layoff plan for certain employees and modified its rules to accommodate the plan. The plan called for six one-day &quot;shutdowns&quot; during the year. The employees claimed that the plan violated the commission's own rules and regulations and violated the employees' rights. The court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court found that the severe financial crisis facing the state constituted an emergency situation. The commission's determination that a certain day would be best to schedule the first layoff provided sufficient support to waive the 30-day notice requirement for modification of the commission's rules. There was no evidence that the affected employees were performing immediate essential public services. The exemption from layoff for workers covered by a collective bargaining agreement was not on the basis of union membership per se, but on the provision of the agreement forbidding such layoffs. Thus, the layoffs did not constitute unfair labor practices. The court also held that the employees' constitutional equal protection and due process arguments were without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court which held that the layoff program was unconstitutional, which enjoined the commission from ordering further layoffs, and which awarded backpay to the affected employees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners applied for a permit with the city to build a backyard tennis court. The city disapproved the tennis court on the grounds that it violated a zoning ordinance prohibiting structures within 35 feet of the rear property line. The zoning board of appeals (board) denied the property owners' request for a variance. The property owners claimed that the tennis court was not a building or a structure subject to the set-back requirements. The court affirmed the trial court's orders. The court held that zoning restrictions were limited to &quot;buildings&quot; or &quot;structures,&quot; that a tennis court was a &quot;structure,&quot; and that the trial court did not err in denying the property owners' motion for summary judgment. The court held that the set-back requirement was not an arbitrary and unreasonable restriction on the use of the property, that the ordinance advanced legitimate interests, that the ordinance was constitutional, and that the trial court properly denied declaratory relief.

The trial court granted the employees' motion for summary judgment, ruling that two of the Commission's and the Department's affirmative action policies were facially unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that the asserted purpose of Commission's and the Department's affirmative action policies was to eliminate the effects of past discrimination. The court held that race and sex could be factors used by an employer when the plan was designed in an effort to correct prior discriminatory practices and where a present selection method was not be free from discriminatory effects.

The trial court granted the injunction, and defendants appealed.

The state's motion for summary judgment, which contended that the assessments became final and the officers were precluded from contesting them because they were not appealed to either the State Board of Tax Appeals (SBTA) or the circuit court was denied. The state appealed the denial. The court affirmed the judgment even though the record indicated that the officers did not follow any of the available appeal procedures. The doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies was inapplicable because the officers had not initially sought relief in the court. The officers were not seeking redress from an adverse agency determination but were merely attempting to defend a civil action brought by the state. Because the doctrine was inapplicable, the officers were allowed to assert any appropriate defenses. Because the officers denied personal liability, a valid defense may have existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of wilfully endangering lives by tampering with railroad property and sentenced to probation. Defendant's probation was later revoked following conviction of second-degree criminal sexual conduct. At the preliminary examination, defendant moved to dismiss the charges on the ground that the statute under which he was prosecuted required a showing of specific intent. Following close of the proofs at trial, defendant again moved to dismiss, arguing that it was impossible to determine from the statute whether specific or general intent was required for a conviction. Defendant objected to the trial judge's refusal to instruct the jury on specific intent. On appeal, the court held that specific intent was not required for a conviction under the tampering with railroad property statute. Therefore, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss or in refusing to give the jury an instruction on specific intent. The court also rejected defendant's contention that the tampering with railroad property statute was void for vagueness. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a consolidated appeal, one defendant challenged an order from the trial court (Michigan) that denied his motion to quash an information charging him with delivery of 50 or more but less than 225 grams of cocaine. The State challenged the trial court's order that dismissed the charge of unlawful possession of over 300 grams containing cocaine against second defendant after construing the statute to mean the weight of pure controlled substance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented by both cases on appeal was whether the weight classifications of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 7401(2)(a), 7403(2)(a) referred to the aggregate weight of a mixture containing a controlled substance or referred solely to the weight of the pure controlled substance. The court affirmed the trial court's refusal to quash the information against one defendant and reversed the dismissal of the charges against second defendant, holding that a plain reading of the statutory language established that the weight classifications referred to the aggregate weight of a mixture. If the legislature had intended to apply the weight classification solely to the controlled substance, then the phrase &quot;of any mixture containing that substance&quot; would be surplusage. Defendants were not denied equal protection of the law because it was reasonable for the legislature to impose higher penalties on those possessing greater amounts of a mixture. The statutes, although not mathematically precise, were not unconstitutionally vague because they delineated the proscribed conduct with reasonable certainty. Any vagueness disappeared with a common sense reading of the statutes.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 600.5851 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.5851) was unconstitutional. The prisoner appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner had testified as a witness in a criminal trial. The prosecutor wrote a letter to the prison warden stating that the prisoner committed perjury. The prisoner petitioned to examine his file pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, discovered the letter, and filed an action for libel. The court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded for trial. The court held that the purpose of the tolling statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5851 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.5851), was to recognize that persons in prison were under a disability in that their freedom had been restricted and their access to the judicial process had been impaired and to provide such persons with additional time to assert their legal rights. There was no question that the legislature had the power to enact the statute and determine the conditions under which a right could accrue and the period in which a right could be asserted. Thus, the trial court erred in finding the statute unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection. Moreover, absent more specific language indicating the statute applied on a case-by-case basis, the court concluded that it should be applied generally to all prisoners.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed a judgment from the Michigan Tax Tribunal, which dismissed their claims against defendant drainage boards for lack of jurisdiction in the owners' suit against the boards and defendant township, claiming that a special assessment for a drain under &sect; 536 of the Michigan Drain Code, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 280.536 (1956), was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the township assessed part of the cost of a drain against the owners, they claimed that the law allowing the assessment was unconstitutional. Their claim against the boards was pending in a circuit court, and the claim against the township was pending before the tax tribunal. The owners argued that one forum had to resolve all claims about drain assessments. Affirming, the court held that the Tax Tribunal did not err in holding that it lacked jurisdiction over the claim against the boards, whose final orders were reviewable in the circuit court under &sect; 280.536. The dispute with the boards did not come within the Tax Tribunal's grant of exclusive jurisdiction under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.731(a), (b). The owners did not seek review of a special assessment. The remedy lay with the legislature, rather than the courts, for the claim that one forum had to resolve claims against the township and the boards. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 280.536 did not violate due process under the Michigan Constitution. When the township made the assessment against the owners, they became directly affected and the township gave them personal notice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to a plea bargain, defendant pled guilty in the trial court (Michigan) to three armed robbery charges and one count of carrying a firearm during the commission of a felony. Sentences for the armed robbery convictions were to run concurrently with a term defendant was serving, and he received a five-year consecutive sentence for the felony-firearm conviction. Defendant appealed as of right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant entered his guilty pleas, he filed a motion to withdraw them, and the court noted that although there was a hearing to consider defendant's motion, no testimony was taken and several questions remain unanswered. Defendant contended that because the total elapsed time between meeting his attorney, pleading guilty, and being sentenced was somewhat less than three hours, his plea could not have been considered voluntary and that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. The court held that where a cognizable claim was raised that counsel did not investigate potentially meritorious defenses, and the time-span from the initial contact between the attorney and his client to the point of the guilty plea was so short that a substantial possibility appeared on the record that potential defenses suggested by defendant were not considered, a full evidentiary hearing on the ineffective assistance of counsel allegation had to be conducted. In addition, the court held that defendant could not properly have received the greater five-year penalty for a second felony-firearm offense unless the second offense was subsequent to his first conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court retained jurisdiction of the case and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on defendant's ineffective of counsel claim, and directed that unless the trial court ascertained that the second felony-firearm offense occurred after conviction on the first offense, it should modify the sentence from five years to two years. All hearings were to be conducted and findings of fact were to be made within 60 days of the release date of the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The appeal arose from the city's refusal to grant a waiver use that would have allowed plaintiff landowner to construct a new four-theater complex on its C-2 zoned property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Livonia, Mich. Ordinance No. 1071, &sect; 1103 (1973) removed theaters as a permitted use in C-2 districts, subject to waiver-use approval, such that a new theater could not build. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and concluded that the city's zoning ordinance was not unconstitutional. The court found, inter alia, that (1) the ordinance did not, on its face, censor any particular type of movie or theater; (2) it applied equally to all theaters; (3) it was a land use regulation and not a censorship ordinance; (4) there were six theaters located in the city; (5) C-2 zoning allowed for numerous commercial ventures for which the land had substantial value; and (6) theaters could be constructed in a C-3 district as a permitted use, but the landowner never petitioned for such a zoning change. Because the ordinance was not facially invalid, it was presumed constitutional where it was not proved otherwise by competent evidence. Where ordinances furthered a reasonable governmental interest and were not arbitrary or capricious, a municipality could constitutionally pass the ordinance to restrict movie theaters to specified areas or preclude them absent a waiver or zoning amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment from a trial court (Michigan), which following a jury trial found him guilty of possession of a &quot;billy.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police found what appeared to have been a &quot;billy&quot; club after they stopped defendant for a routine traffic violation. Defendant contended that he was an avid fisherman and that he used the &quot;billy&quot; to stun large fish. Reversing, the court held that constitutional challenges for vagueness or overbreadth, where the claim did not touch the First Amendment, must be examined in the light of the facts at hand. The court ruled that the portion of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.224(1) prohibiting the manufacture, sale, offering for sale, or possession of a &quot;billy&quot;, as applied to these facts, was unconstitutionally overbroad because it proscribed conduct which was otherwise wholly innocent. The court found that possession of a &quot;fish billy,&quot; commercially sold and used as such was not within the ambit of the statute. The court held that because the term &quot;billy&quot; was not defined by the statute, and reasonable citizens could purchase and use such implements in sport fishing, totally innocent of any wrongful knowledge or intent, the lack of specificity in the statute made the law unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The church established a school located in its church building. The curriculum was oriented toward religion. Twenty students were enrolled. An inspector reported that the building violated school fire safety regulations. The church contended that the application of the regulations to the building was unreasonable and arbitrary and imposed an unconstitutional burden on the free exercise of religious beliefs. The trial court enjoined the church from using the building as a school until written approval was obtained from the state fire marshal. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the building met the definition of a &quot;school building,&quot; under Mich. Admin. Code r. 29.16(2) (1979). Thus, the fire safety regulations for schools applied. The burden placed on the practice of the church's religion was at most financial. The fire safety regulations did not prevent the operation of a religious school. The church was prevented only from conducting the school in a building that did not meet fire safety standards applicable to all schools. The purpose of the regulations was clearly a secular purpose and the application to the building was not unreasonable or arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from an order of a circuit court (Michigan) granting youthful trainee status to defendant under the Holmes Youthful Trainee Act (Act), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 762.11 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was bound over on a charge of felonious driving. He was 21 years of age on the date of the offense. The trial court granted defendant's petition to be assigned youthful trainee status, although his age exceeded the upper limit provided in the Act. The trial court reasoned that the Act violated equal protection requirements. On appeal, the court held that the Act did not violate equal protection requirements. Age was not a suspect classification for equal protection purposes; thus, the rational basis test, rather than the strict scrutiny test, was used. The cutoff point at age 20 was not unreasonable or arbitrary. The legislature apparently wanted to provide an alternative procedure to moderate the abrupt change in status occurring between the juvenile court system and the adult criminal process. Defendant's claim that his fundamental right to freedom was impaired by the denial of youthful trainee status was meritless because the denial of liberty could occur only after he was found guilty in a judicial proceeding at which he would be provided the full right and protections guaranteed under the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and vacated the trial court's order granting defendant youthful trainee status and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff schools cross-appealed the trial court's ruling that the statute applied to the schools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The schools argued that, because the state department of labor was statutorily required to set the prevailing wage rate at union rate, the legislature had unconstitutionally delegated its power to a private party. The schools argued that the prevailing wage statute was constitutionally defective because it delegated to the unions, or to the unions and contractor employers together, the authority to determine the wage rate on state projects. The court rejected these arguments. The court held that the department of labor's determination of that prevailing wage did not amount to the setting of any state policy. The court held that the department was merely authorized to implement what the legislature had already declared to be the law in Michigan. The court also held the relevant statute did not contain the delegation asserted by the schools. The court held that the statute expressed the policy that wages equal to union scale were to be paid to both union and nonunion workers on public construction projects. Accordingly, the court affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the decision of the trial court and ordered the permanent injunction dissolved.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the arbitration process was voluntary and revocable and, because of the safeguards provided in the proceedings and the arbitrator selection process, the statute was constitutional.

Defendant was not present in the first lineup. The court found that defendant did not meet his burden of proving that the lineup was impermissibly suggestive. Defendant argued that his convictions of criminal sexual assault in the perpetration of a felony and armed robbery violated his right to be free of being placed twice in jeopardy. The court found that defendant's convictions were constitutional under the Blockburger test because the elements of the two crimes were not legally necessary to convict defendant of the other. However, the court found that the conviction for armed robbery against the woman failed to pass constitutional muster because the facts indicated that the violations were not severable and because there was no clear legislative intent to make the two offenses separate and distinct and separate penalties had not been provided.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Common Pleas Court of Detroit appealed as of right a Wayne County Circuit Court (Michigan) order of superintending control that ordered an official reporter to attend each session of the Common Pleas Court, including the Landlord-Tenant Division, and report verbatim all proceedings unless the parties agreed otherwise, and that reversed the contempt citation of an attorney.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complaint challenged the practice of the Common Pleas Court, Landlord-Tenant Division of refusing to provide a court reporter where one had been demanded and the fee paid. In holding that a superintending order was proper, the court stated that it would have been burdensome to require litigants to appeal individual cases each time the right to a court reporter had been denied. In view of the fact that the entitlement to litigants of a court reporter was so clear that it could not have been denied, it would have wasted valuable court time to require individual appeals. The court also found that the circuit court's jurisdiction over the contempt conviction of the attorney was proper. Although the attorney's contempt conviction standing alone would not have provided jurisdiction for superintending control, when combined with other actions of the judge as alleged in the complaint the contempt conviction did appear to be an integral part of the complaint of general practices of the Landlord-Tenant Division of the Common Pleas Court. There was no valid justification for a distinction between landlord-tenant litigants and litigants who proceeded in other district courts of Michigan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, holding that the statute mandating the payment of a $ 3 fee for a court reporter in the Detroit Common Pleas Court was unconstitutional and that the circuit court did not err in ordering judges of the Detroit Common Pleas Court to provide a court reporter at all judicial proceedings without regard to whether the fee had been paid. The reversal of the attorney's contempt citation was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The college hired an orchestra to perform on campus. During the performance, the musician fell off the stage and was injured. The musician filed a petition for workers' compensation benefits listing the orchestra as his uninsured employer and the college as his &quot;statutory employer.&quot; The workers' compensation bureau rendered a decision awarding the musician benefits from the college, a decision that the college appealed. Meanwhile, the musician brought a negligence action against the college. The trial court entered an order denying the college's motion for accelerated judgment. On interlocutory appeal, the court reversed the order and remanded the action to the trial court with instructions to hold the matter in abeyance pending resolution of college's appeal from the workers' compensation benefit award. The court held that (1) under the exclusive remedy provision of the Michigan Worker's Disability Compensation Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 418.131, a principal who was liable for payment of workers' compensation benefits to an uninsured contractor's employee was entitled to immunity from a civil action; and (2) the musician failed to show a due process or equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

The concept of separation of powers was violated because the executive branch was allowed to judge the competency of a discharged employee of the legislative branch and order reinstatement.

The van was seized, and a warrant to search the van was issued based on the affidavit of an officer who was neither the arresting officer nor one of those working undercover. Defendant argued that the search was illegal because the supporting affidavit for the warrant was insufficient in that it was not based totally on the affiant's own personal observations. The court found that the Aguilar-Spinelli test was inapplicable because a confidential informant did not provide the information and that the magistrate was entitled to assume the information was credible because a law enforcement officer supplied it. Defendant also argued that his conviction under &sect; 7401 of the Public Health Code, Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner purchased a lot zoned for residential use. Most of the landowner's lot was rezoned for business use, with a small portion zoned for residential use. The landowner used the lot for his car dealership. The adjoining landowners had entered into a consent judgment with defendant zoning board, modifying the boundary between the business and residential areas. The effect was to zone the landowner's lot as entirely residential. The landowner filed an action against the city for a ruling that his use was a valid nonconforming use. The trial court awarded judgment to the landowner. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court was not clearly in error. At the time the landowner created a parking lot, his lot was mostly zoned for business use. The landowner's use as a car dealership was already in existence of the time of the amendment to residential use. Thus, the essential requirement for a finding of a nonconforming use was met, under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.583a, (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.2933(1)). The consent judgment was not binding on the landowner and did not operate to defeat his lawfully established nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

Laws &sect; 710.54 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27.3178(555.54)) and Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 710.69 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27.3178(555.69)).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disputed portions of the Michigan Adoption Code prohibited the exchange of money or other consideration in connection with adoption and related proceedings. The parents had entered into a written agreement with the surrogate for her to bear and deliver a child fathered by means of artificial insemination. The parents alleged that the disputed statutory provisions impermissibly infringed upon their constitutional right to privacy, that the state had no compelling interest, and that the provisions were drawn too wide. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants. The court held that while the decision to bear a child was a fundamental interest protected by the right of privacy, the right was not a valid prohibition to state interference in the parties' contractual arrangement. The court found that the statutes did not directly prohibit the parents from having the child as planned, but instead it precluded them from paying consideration in conjunction with their use of the state's adoption procedures. The court concluded that the statutes were constitutional, rendering consideration of the parents' remaining contentions unnecessary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee employee sought the recovery of partial disability benefits from appellant employer. On the basis that &sect; 251 (Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the employer was deprived of due process of law when the Board panel, consisting of three members appointed as representatives of employee interests, heard the employer's appeal of the referee's decision in the employee's favor. The members were representatives of employee interest as board members were defined by &sect; 418.251. In affirming, the court noted that, where the risk of bias was too high, decisionmakers were to be disqualified without a showing of actual bias. Reviewing the situations in which the risk of bias could be too high, the court noted that the employer did not claim that the representatives of employee interests had a pecuniary interest in the outcome, had been the target of personal abuse, or were enmeshed in matters involving a party. Further, none of them could have prejudged the case because of prior participation as an accuser, investigator, factfinder, or initial decisionmaker because they could only act as members of the Board by virtue of the provisions of the statute by which they were appointed. Because no actual bias was alleged, the court determined that the designation of the Board members was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1975, while he was serving a sentence in Wisconsin on a federal kidnapping conviction, defendant was convicted in the trial court of armed robbery. Defendant was later convicted of second-degree murder in Michigan; the sentence imposed ran concurrently with the federal sentence. In 1977, the court reversed the armed robbery conviction. In 1978, Michigan filed a detainer, under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 780.601 et seq., because defendant was still incarcerated in Wisconsin. In 1979, the trial court again convicted defendant of armed robbery. On appeal, the court ruled that: (1) the nine-month delay between the reversal of the first conviction and the filing of the detainer did not violate the 180-day rule of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 780.131 because defendant was not incarcerated in Michigan; (2) defendant did not carry his burden and prove that, for purposes of his constitutional right to a speedy trial, he was prejudiced by the 15-month delay between reversal of the first conviction and the second trial; and (3) the murder conviction was sufficient to justify the imposition of a sentence that was more harsh that that imposed in the first trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Residing with each couple were their children and six unrelated adults, all members of a religious nonprofit organization. &quot;Family&quot; was defined by Delta Township, Michigan Ordinance &sect; 2.2.0(28) as a group of persons related by blood, marriage, or adoption, including foster children and servants, together with not more than one additional person not so related living together. The couples argued that the township had no authority to define &quot;family&quot; within its zoning ordinances and that the ordinances violated state laws against restrictions on land use and the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. The court denied relief. The township was authorized to define the term &quot;family&quot; because its limited powers were expressly conferred upon it by the Michigan Constitution, by the Zoning Enabling Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.271 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.2963(1)), or were necessarily implied therefrom. The couples misplaced reliance on a state law barring restrictions on land use because the township did not totally ban the couples' proposed land use. Decisional law provided that such zoning was a legitimate guideline toward a permissible goal. Thus, the ordinances were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with breaking and entering. His counsel stated that the parties had reached an agreement whereby defendant pleaded guilty but mentally ill to an added count of larceny in a building. The trial court questioned defendant about the proffered plea, during which time defendant expressed considerable confusion as to what was transpiring, gave inculpatory testimony as to the factual basis for a guilty plea, and decided not to enter a guilty plea. The same judge who had heard the factual basis for the aborted guilty plea presided at the bench trial. The court held that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to disqualify itself as the trier of fact or in failing to inform defendant of his right to have a different judge sit as the trier of fact. Defendant had the same right to be heard by an impartial trial judge when sitting as a trier of fact as when a jury was impaneled to determine the facts. Thus, the potential effects on the impartiality of the trial court having first elicited sufficient facts from defendant to establish a factual basis for his guilt were too great to ignore or discount.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant purchased wine from the liquor store contemporaneously with the theft of liquor from the rear of the store. Defendant admitted that he knew before the fact &quot;what was going down.&quot; Defendant rode to and from the store in the car with the principals in the larceny offense. After defendant gave the police officers consent to enter the dwelling, they discovered the stolen liquor bottles. The court reversed defendant's conviction for receiving and concealing stolen property. The court held that defendant could not complain about any alleged illegality with respect to the search because he had consented to the search. The officers had probable cause to arrest defendant after discovering the stolen liquor bottles and the exigent circumstances were sufficient to circumvent the warrant requirement. The instruction that the jury could, but need not, infer defendant's knowledge that the property was stolen from the circumstances did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof. The trial court's refusal to instruct the jury that it must acquit defendant of receiving and concealing stolen property if it found that defendant had participated in the larceny was reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners appealed an order of the Circuit Court for Ingham County (Michigan) granting summary judgment to defendant township on the owners' challenge to special assessments levied against their lands for the widening and improvement of an intercounty drain and its tributaries pursuant to Chapter 21 of the Drain Code of 1956, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 280.1 et seq. The counts against two defendant county drainage boards remained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the procedures set forth in the Drain Code, the boards met to hear objections to a proposed apportionment of the costs of the project, which required the township to bear a certain percentage of the costs of the drain. The owners contended that even though they were major property owners of the township, they were not given notice reasonably calculated to reach them before the final order of apportionment of costs was approved. The township in turn assessed its portion against the especially-benefited property owners. Upon the owners' challenge, the trial court granted summary judgment to the township but let the complaint stand as to the boards. The court affirmed, agreeing with the trial court that the owners' complaints about procedural defects in the levying process were more properly asserted against the boards and not the township. Further, jurisdiction of the questions raised as to whether the township had properly levied the assessments lay with the tax tribunal and not with the trial court. Last, &sect; 539 of the Drain Code was not unconstitutional because it did not provide for the corrections of special assessments, as such relief was provided in other legislation.</SPAN></P>

The shareholders had sought dissenter's rights to the corporation's action extending its life from 30 years to an indefinite term, under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 450.1621 (Mich. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was incorporated in 1947 for a term of 30 years, which was then the maximum term permitted by Michigan law. To extend the corporate term, an affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the outstanding shares was required, under Mich. Const. art. 12, &sect; 3 (1908). Constitutional limitations on the duration of corporate life were abrogated in 1963. At a 1975 shareholders meeting, the corporation's articles of incorporation were amended by a majority vote to extend the corporate life to a perpetual term. The shareholders, owners of approximately 41 percent of the outstanding shares, voted against the amendment. They claimed that the right to redemption included the right of pro rata distribution of assets upon the corporation's dissolution. The court held that upon the impending expiration of the corporation's existence the shareholders were not possessed of a right of redemption that was materially altered by the amendment extending the corporate term. However, the state could not under its reserved power impair or destroy vested property rights or impair the contractual obligations of third parties. Therefore, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer sought review of the judgment of the Ingham County Circuit Court (Michigan), which upon consideration of the taxpayer's motion for leave to file an appeal, sua sponte remanded, pursuant &sect; 79 of the Tax Tribunal Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.779, the taxpayer's case regarding the assessment of taxes by defendant, a state department of treasury, to the state board of taxation appeals (SBTA).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.779 transferred jurisdiction over appeals from various tax assessments to a newly created tax tribunal. The state's attorney general determined that &sect; 205.779 was unconstitutional because it violated Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 25. The trial court found that the attorney general's opinion was in error; thus, the trial court found that it lacked jurisdiction over the taxpayer's case. On appeal, the court held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.779 was constitutional, as Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 25 did not invalidate amendments or repeal by implication. However, the court determined that the trial court had erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction over the taxpayer's appeal, as several enactments, including 1980 Mich. Pub. Acts 162, demonstrated the state legislature's intent to continue the jurisdiction of the SBTA despite the attorney general's opinion. Because any appeal on the merits could not be filed until after January 1, 1981, 1980 Mich. Pub. Acts 162 provided the taxpayer with an appeal to the court as of right; however, such appeal could only be taken by leave, as the taxpayer had delayed for over four months in seeking to appeal the SBTA's decision.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff and defendant entered into a settlement agreement. Plaintiff, acting individually and as guardian for the estate of the deceased, filed a complaint against defendant and third-party plaintiff, alleging that the injuries resulted from the arena's failure to maintain a safe premises and failure to prevent injury to its patrons. The arena filed a third-party complaint seeking contribution or indemnification from defendant. The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed. Under Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &sect; 600.2925(d)(c), a comparative negligence theory did not deprive the arena of due process or equal protection. The legislation bore a reasonable relation to this proper legislative objective and did not violate due process. It was logical to assume that joint tortfeasors would be more likely to enter into settlement negotiations if they knew they would not be entitled to contribution if the other tortfeasor settled and they did not. Because a rational basis existed to justify the classification, it did not violate the equal protection clauses.</SPAN></P>

The employees submitted claims for personal protection insurance benefits from the insurer for medical expenses and lost wages. The insurer denied liability, and the employees filed suit. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the employees. The trial court found that the insurer was not entitled under Mich. Comp.

The court reversed, holding that the terms of &sect; 500.3109(1) clearly and unambiguously gave the insurer the right to subtract benefits that were required to be provided by law regardless of whether they were paid. The court concluded that it had no alternative but to apply &sect; 500.3109(1) as the legislature wrote it.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a &quot;no cause&quot; verdict on the guardian's claim. The trial court denied the ward and guardian's motion for a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The action was commenced as the result of an automobile accident. The driver and the ward, aged 18 and 17 respectively, had been drinking before the accident. The ward was severely injured, suffering permanent brain damage resulting in speech loss and loss of motor coordination. The trial court found him incompetent to testify. A verdict was directed against the ward on the basis that the trial court found he was a noninnocent party under the dramshop act. On appeal, the court affirmed as to the guardian and reversed as to the ward. The court erred in directing its verdict against the ward where reasonable minds could have disagreed on the proper resolution of the case in light of the testimony adduced. Testimony was conflicting as to who purchased the beer consumed by the driver, whether it was the driver or the ward. The court held that active participation on the part of the ward in the intoxication of the driver was not made out by evidence only tending to show that the ward drank with the intoxicated driver. The court held that a directed verdict against the ward did not deprive the guardian of a right to recover.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from a trial court (Michigan), which convicted her of inciting second-degree murder. Defendant claimed that she was entrapped by the police and that the statute under which she was convicted, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.157b (1968), was unconstitutional as a form of cruel and unusual punishment and was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made requests of another individual to cause an accident that would kill her husband. Several of her conversations regarding her desire to have her husband murdered were recorded. She was arrested and charged with inciting first-degree murder. An entrapment hearing was held, and the trial court ruled that defendant had not been entrapped. Defendant pleaded guilty to inciting second-degree murder. Defendant later appealed, and the court upheld her conviction. The court held that there was no evidence of entrapment by the police and that the police actions could in no way be construed as scandalous or reprehensible. The police had knowledge that on a prior occasion some type of assault was made on defendant's husband, and the police were not required to adopt a wait and see attitude pending the occurrence of a tragedy. Next, the court ruled that defendant was properly charged under &sect; 750.157b for inciting, inducing, or exhorting another to commit the crime of murder. The court noted that although the statute was enacted during a period of widespread upheaval in Detroit several Michigan courts had already rejected the contention that the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA) sought a writ of mandamus directing defendant secretary of state to collect fees imposed under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 124.416a (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5.3475(116a)). The secretary of state ceased such collections after the state attorney general issued an opinion that the statute authorizing the collection of such fees was void because it conflicted with Mich. Const. 1963 art. 9, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute authorized the collection in three counties of a motor vehicle registration fee and transfer of title fee for public transportation purposes. The court granted SEMTA's petition for a writ of mandamus. The court agreed with the attorney general's conclusion that the taxes imposed were not &quot;use taxes&quot; falling within the exception contained in Mich. Const. 1963 art. 9, &sect; 9. The court, however, disagreed with the attorney general's conclusion that the statute facially violated &sect; 9, which provided that not more than 10 percent of the specified taxes could be used for mass transportation purposes. The court rejected the contention that &sect; 9 required 90 percent of each specific tax, rather than 90 percent of the aggregate of the constitutionally earmarked taxes, to be earmarked for conventional highway purposes. The court held that &sect; 9 imposed its limitations in the aggregate and, thus, found that the statute did not exceed the 10 percent constitutional limitation. Because the existence of two funds presented the possibility of unconstitutional distribution of the funds, the court directed the secretary of state to hold the funds in escrow to await a legislative remedy.</SPAN></P>

The tax tribunal dismissed the petition. The supervisors appealed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the judge held that Detroit, Mich., Municipal Code ch. 39, art. I, &sect; 39-1-52 was unenforceable, he dismissed any ordinance violation charges. The city obtained a superintending control, which found the judge in contempt for the refusal to enforce &sect; 39-1-52. The judge claimed that the superintending control order was invalid because it was an improper appeal. The court affirmed the superintending control order but vacated the contempt order because the city only requested that the court rule on the validity of the superintending order. The superintending control order was proper to challenge the judge's generalized practice of dismissal &sect; 39-1-52 violations, though other judges of the same court allowed did not dismiss such charges. The issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 39-1-52 was not before the court where there was no defendant before the court charged with its violation. However, the court did hold that whether &sect; 39-1-52 was enforceable did not deprive the judge with jurisdiction over the matter. Also, the city had the authority to pass the criminal ordinance, which was not preempted by any state statute, because the city was a home rule city.</SPAN></P>

The employee filed suit claiming that the employer was grossly negligent because safety guards were intentionally removed from the machine which injured the employee.

On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and found no Fourth Amendment violations. The court found defendant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy as to the vicinity in which he and his brother were shooting skeet and that therefore, the observations of the officers did not constitute a search.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant alleged that she initially consented to getting into defendant's car for the express purpose of finding her boyfriend. Thereafter, defendant and his accomplice drove her out into the country against her will and raped her. A jury subsequently found defendant guilty of criminal sexual conduct and kidnapping. On appeal, the court noted that the fact that the complainant possessed less than average intelligence was repeatedly brought out in the presence of the jury. Further, having been privy to a competency hearing in the accomplice's trial, defense counsel waived a competency hearing. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the complainant to testify. Further, a rational trier of fact could have found that the complainant revoked her initial consent and that the trip into the country satisfied the requisite kidnapping element of asportation. Moreover, the prosecutor's inadvertent reference to the accomplice's statement in the lengthy trial could not be said to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Finally, the attending physician's expert testimony, that there had been penetration against the complainant's will, was admissible.</SPAN></P>

The fire department was summoned to battle the fire and a rookie firefighter was killed. Defendant was charged with first-degree felony-murder. However, he was convicted of manslaughter and of burning insured property. On appeal, the court reversed the convictions. The court agreed with defendant's argument that the trial court committed reversible error by charging the jury on first-degree murder and arson because there was insufficient evidence presented to establish that the burned building was a dwelling house inside the meaning of the arson statute. The court found that the owner of the building testified that she did not want the house and had unsuccessfully sought to deed the property back to the mortgage company. The court also found that the house had been abandoned prior to the burning and was not fit for habitation when the fire occurred. The court reasoned that although death tragically resulted in this case, it was a death that did not call into play the special protection afforded by the prohibition against arson. Lastly, the court ruled that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury on preparation to burn property.</SPAN></P>

The people were not required to produce an informant because he was not a res gestae witness. Possession was proved through circumstantial evidence, which showed that the trunk of defendants' rented car contained an unopened bag that held 43 pounds of marijuana and that defendants held the key to the trunk.

Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3101 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24.13101 et seq.), to the suit filed by plaintiffs, truck insurer and subrogee, to recover damages stemming from a fire on the garage's premises. The truck insurer and subrogee also appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A truck and the garage where it was being repaired were destroyed or damaged when a bare lightbulb was ignited during repairs. The trial court held that the Garage Keepers' Liability Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 256.541 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9.1721 et seq.), controlled and established a rebuttable presumption that whenever a motor vehicle was damaged while in a storage or repair garage, the damage was due to the garage's negligence. The court agreed with the trial court that the Garage Keepers' Liability Act was applicable and rendered the No Fault Insurance Act of no effect, particularly as the requisite causal connection between the damage and the vehicle's maintenance was not present. Moreover, the court concluded that whenever a bailment-for-hire situation was presented, the bailment of the vehicle and not its maintenance governed, and that to hold otherwise would unnecessarily eviscerate the Garage Keepers' Liability Act and would extend no-fault insurance coverage beyond the legislature's intention when the No-Fault Insurance Act was enacted because bailment was not included among the three exceptions to the abolishment of tort liability for property damage in that Act .</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's determination that the liability for the damage to the truck insurer's property was governed by the bailment provisions as opposed to the no fault automobile insurance laws.</SPAN></P>

The jury convicted defendant of first-degree sexual conduct, and defendant appealed. In affirming, the court held that the testimony of the examining physician that the complainant had been sexually assaulted was proper, because the physician did not testify that defendant raped the complainant at a specific time or place or that he believe the complainant's claim. The court also held that Mich. Comp. Laws 750.520 (Mich. Stat. Ann. 28.788(10)), which barred evidence of the complainant's past sexual conduct, was constitutional and did not violate defendant's right to confrontation. Further, psychological evidence of the complainant's sexual propensities was irrelevant to the issue of whether she consented, and thus, the trial court properly denied defendant's request for a court-ordered psychological examination of the complainant. Because defendant voluntarily gave a statement to the police after he was given his Miranda warnings, evidence regarding his statements was admissible and did not violate defendant's right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was already on probation, provoked a scuffle in the courthouse after a judge threatened him with jail for failing to pay child support. During the scuffle, he bit one of the court employees on the arm. After a contested hearing, defendant was found to be in violation of the conditions of his probation that prohibited antisocial conduct and was sentenced to prison. Defendant appealed the order of the court revoking his probation. He argued that the antisocial conduct provision of his probation conditions gave no notice of what was actually proscribed and as a result was unconstitutionally vague and a violation of due process. The court held that the condition was impermissibly vague on its face, but that defendant's probation officer specifically informed defendant that fighting was an example of antisocial conduct. The court held that the testimony was sufficient to show that defendant was accorded prior notice of the terms of his probation. The court also held defendant was entitled to resentencing at which the trial court was to consider a reasonably updated presentence report.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The controller took records and accounts from the county clerk's office and assumed its accounting and payroll functions. The county clerk filed a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the controller and the board to return the records and to return his duties to him, which the trial court granted. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court ruled that the clerk had a clear right to the records and accounts under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 46.4 (Mich. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the employer voted to fire the employee, the union filed an unfair labor practice. A hearing examiner found that the employee had been fired in violation of &sect; 10(1)(a), (c) of the public employment relations act (PERA) contained at Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 423.201 et seq. The Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC) upheld the hearing examiner's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed MERC's decision. Based upon precedent, the court held that separation of powers did not preclude MERC from exercising jurisdiction over the employee's claim. The court further held that separation of powers did not preclude the applicability of PERA to the employee's claim. MERC's determination that the employee's job fit within PERA was supported by precedent and did not interfere with the employer's judicial functions. Finally, evidence that the employer fired the employee after learning that the employee's remarks at a union meeting incited divisiveness and encouraged obstruction of management was sufficient to support a finding that the employer fired her for exercising protected activity under Mich.

The clerk certified the petitions and directed that the annexation matter be submitted at the next general election. The annexation petition was approved. The trial court held that 1978 Mich. Pub.

An act thus complete within itself, even though repealing by implication another statute, was not a violation of that constitutional provision. No allegation was made that the county clerk applied any inappropriate standard in certifying the petitions filed with him regarding the annexation as valid, or that some other standard should have been applied and, if applied, would have led to the invalidating of the petitions.</SPAN></P>

Before returning to the prison, defendant drank a few beers. Upon returning, the guard attempted a shakedown of defendant under the suspicion that defendant had been drinking. Defendant tried to leave the office, and struck the guard with a shovel. Pursuant to an agreement, defendant entered a plea of guilty to assaulting a prison employee. Defendant sought review of his conviction, enumerating several errors in regard to his guilty plea. One of defendant's contentions was that his right to a speedy trial was violated by the 373-day delay between the date of arrest and the trial date. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court found that the delay was attributable to court congestion. The court held that while the nature of the delay was attributable to the state, it was only given minimal weight in determining whether defendant's right to a speedy trial was violated. In addition, defendant never asserted his right to a speedy trial. The court held that defendant did not suffer any prejudice due to the delay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmates appealed a judgment from the Marquette County Circuit Court (Michigan), which held that a municipal fire code did not apply to a state prison located in the municipality. Defendant Department of Corrections cross-appealed the circuit court's holding that the Michigan Housing Act of 1917, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.401 et seq., applied to the prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates contended that both the Housing Act and the local fire code applied to the prison. The court concluded that the circuit court erred in deciding that the Housing Act applied, while holding that the fire code did not, because Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 125.539(a) provided that the fire code of a community where a building subject to the housing act was located was incorporated into the Housing Act by reference. The court found that, standing by itself, the Housing Act applied to state prisons, but reversed the circuit court's judgment to that effect because: (1) Mich. Comp. Laws &sect;&sect; 791.202, 791.204, and the title of the act establishing the Department showed that the legislature intended to vest the Department with complete jurisdiction over state prisons and to nullify the applicability of any contrary legislation; (2) the legislature was presumed to have knowledge of existing laws; and (3) the State Department of Corrections Act was enacted 36 years after the Housing Act. In addition, the state supreme court had previously construed the same provisions of the Department of Corrections Act and concluded that the Department was not subject to municipal zoning ordinances.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that injunctive relief would not be granted unless the plaintiffs alleged injury to their property or person, that they would suffer irreparable injury, and that they had no adequate remedy at law. The court further held that the mobile home owners had not shown a property interest in the site and that they had an adequate remedy at law. Finally, the court held that the injunction was not properly granted pursuant to proposed Rule 2004, because the rule was only proposed and therefore not binding, and that there were disputed issues of fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chiropractor challenged &sect; 16401(1)(b) of the Code, which excluded incisive surgical procedures, invasive procedures requiring instrumentation, and the dispensing or prescribing of drugs or medicine from the practice of chiropractic. The trial court found in favor of defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that the chiropractor's complaint did not allege facts which would support the conclusion that the restrictions in &sect; 16401(1)(b) made it impossible for him to perform the functions which the legislature had included in the practice of chiropractic. The court found that the fact that other practitioners of medicine were permitted to perform the procedures prohibited of chiropractors by &sect; 16401(1)(b) did not deny the chiropractor equal protection of the laws. The court concluded that there were no factual allegations supporting the conclusion that there was no rational basis to the legislature's medical practice classifications.

After granting partial judgment, a trial was held on damages, which resulted in a further judgment for the employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was precluded from consideration for a position because his father worked for the sanitation division of the same department. The trial court found that the charter provision violated equal protection. The trial court also reasoned that because of city growth, the issue of nepotism was no longer a great problem. On appeal, the court disagreed. The court first found that a middle level of scrutiny applied. The right to employment was not a &quot;fundamental&quot; right to justify a higher level. The provision was precisely drafted and had a fair and substantial relationship to the legislative purpose of limiting nepotism. The provision was not an overly broad act because it did not preclude the employee from other positions in departments where his father did not work. Because of the constitutional question, the court did not reach the issue of damages.</SPAN></P>

On June 8, 1978, they received an administrative hearing at which they were not permitted to address the merits of their disciplinary charges. After the hearing, they were placed in solitary confinement pending a further disciplinary hearing. The inmates then filed their petition for relief, which the trial court denied on July 18, 1978, on grounds of failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The inmates were kept in solitary confinement for eight months until a disciplinary hearing was held, at which time they received penalties of an additional seven days in solitary confinement. On appeal, the court held that the first hearing amounted to a sham because although the inmates were not permitted to offer their proofs on the merits, the hearing resulted in their being kept in solitary confinement for eight months pending the matter's resolution. The court further held that the exhaustion doctrine did not apply because a controlling constitutional issue had been raised and additional administrative procedures would have been useless.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review from an order of the trial court (Michigan) that granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence of a gun and dismissed the charge against defendant of carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.424).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state argued that defendant did not have a right to carry a concealed weapon on the street that abutted his property. Defendant argued that he did, reasoning that, as an owner of the property, he had retained ownership of the property to the middle of the street and that the public only had an easement in that land. The state also argued that the police officer had the authority to ask defendant for his driver's license when he was observed unlocking an illegally parked automobile. The court agreed that defendant did not have the right to carry a concealed weapon on the street that abutted his property. However, the court rejected the state's argument that the police officer had the right to ask defendant for his driver's license and affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the charge. The court found that a public street was not an area that deserved the special status where defendant could rightfully carry a concealed weapon. Nevertheless, the police officer had no reasonable cause or even a mere inkling to believe that criminal activity had been, or was about to be, committed by defendant. Thus, the illegal stop tainted the subsequent arrest and search of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from a trial court (Michigan), which convicted him of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and second-degree criminal sexual conduct, in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520b, .520c, for the sexual penetration of defendant's two stepdaughters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court determined that the factual basis elicited from defendant was sufficient to support a conviction for first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and that the trial court complied with Mich. Gen. Ct. R. 785.7 (1963) in accepting defendant's plea of guilty to that charge. Thus, that conviction was upheld. However, the conviction for second-degree criminal sexual conduct was reversed. Evidence that the victim was &quot;upset&quot; was not sufficient to satisfy the element of mental anguish required for a conviction on that charge. Accordingly, because the element of personal injury was not sufficiently established, defendant's guilty plea to that charge was invalid. The court further noted that in light of the fact that defendant lacked personal knowledge to establish the element of personal injury, a nolo plea would have been more appropriate than a guilty plea, as it would have allowed the trial court to use the testimony of the complainant or other prosecution witnesses, e.g., doctors, psychiatrists, employers, relatives, etc. to establish that there had been a pregnancy, loss of a sexual organ, a disease, or extreme mental anguish.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's plea of guilty to second-degree criminal sexual conduct, affirmed the conviction on the charge of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, and remanded the case so that defendant could either enter a plea of nolo contendere on the charge of second-degree criminal sexual conduct or submit himself to a trial on the merits.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor examined the injured student and approved his physical condition for wrestling. While wrestling in a physical education course, the student suffered a subluxation of two vertebrae that resulted in quadriplegia. The trial court granted summary judgment for the doctor on the ground that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and for the school district on the ground that it was immune from tort liability. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the school district, finding that its operation of a public school was a uniquely governmental function and that it was entitled to governmental immunity under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 691.1407. However, the court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the doctor. The complaint demonstrated an issue of fact regarding the course followed by the doctor in his examination of the student.

The city asserted that the taxpayer had not challenge a certain year's assessment before its board of review (board). The tribunal reduced the valuations of the property for all tax years except the one. Judgment was entered and the city appealed. The taxpayer cross-appealed dismissal of the decision regarding the one tax year. The court affirmed, holding that the tribunal's application of a mortgage-equity formula for assessing the capitalization rate of the property was proper.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the trial court (Michigan), which convicted him of forgery and being a habitual offender, second offense, pursuant to Mich.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the plea bargain was illusory because he had not been fully advised of his rights in conjunction with a prior plea-based conviction. At most, he argued he could be found guilty under the habitual offender statute as a third offender with a maximum penalty of 28 years, rather than a fourth offender with a maximum of life imprisonment. The court disagreed. However, even if the argument were correct, the court could not agree that prejudicial error occurred in sentencing. Defendant was charged with two distinct felonies and was guilty of violating the habitual offender statute, at least as a third-felony offender. As his total sentence was only 6 to 14 years, it could hardly be said that he did not receive all that justice allowed. Common sense and logic compelled the court to conclude that he was neither prejudiced nor harmed by the inclusion of the fourth-felony conviction, to which he entered a guilty plea only 11 days after the United States Supreme Court issued Boykin v. Alabama. The court also found no merit to defendant's claim that he was convicted and sentenced twice, because the record reflected a single conviction and sentence by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department filed a claim for the return of money paid for the care of the deceased. Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 600.5821(4) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 27A.5821(4)) provided that the recovery of the cost of maintenance was not subject to the statute of limitations and could be brought at any time. The court reversed the judgment. The estate argued that a hearing more than ten years after the cause of action accrued was not a fair hearing as contemplated by the due process clause. The court held that the delay in the case was not so egregious that the estate had suffered a serious deprivation. The court held that the state was required to provide medical services for mentally incompetent persons regardless of ability to pay for such services. Yet the individual was financially liable for services provided by the Michigan Department of Mental Health. The court held that the state had a legitimate interest in protecting its revenue by collecting debts owed for care in state institutions and that there was no denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the insurer's argument that the pharmacy was an inadequate class representative and upheld the class certification. The court found irrelevant the fact that the pharmacy sold its business after filing its complaint, but before the class was certified because the case covered a limited time period during which the pharmacy and other potential class members participated in the prescription program. The class also met the convenient administration of justice standard because the class was identifiable and large enough to make it impractical for each member to personally appear, and the representative was a class member. The court adopted the trial court's order on computing and creating a damages fund because it considered and solved the practical problems of the case, including determining how much money each class member was entitled to receive.</SPAN></P>

(&sect; 15.1971 et seq.), and the circuit court reversed. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court's decision, holding that prior judgments in actions against the board finding that the tenure act was inapplicable to the termination of teachers for non-compliance with an agency shop clause were not res judicata in the teacher's case. Further, procedural due process required notice and an opportunity to be heard before the tenured teacher was dismissed under the agency shop clause. However, the board's failure to provide the teacher with a hearing before her discharge did not entitle her to relief because it was so clear that she deliberately refused to pay the agency shop fees required of her.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The regents sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction against the association for disruptions to their meeting. The association counterclaimed that the regents were in non-compliance with the Act. The trial court issued a declaratory judgment that allowed the meeting to be recessed and moved. The injunction request was denied due to the adequate legal remedy afforded, and the counterclaim was also denied. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's rulings and held that the grant of the &quot;recess and remove&quot; procedure did not violate the Act's notice requirements. The court found the plain language of the Act did not require a meeting recessed less than 36 hours to have a new notice. The court also found that the association's position, that relocation changed the meeting's categorization from recessed to rescheduled, was without merit. The court noted that the regents complied with the spirit of the Act by having posted officials at their original meeting place to advise the press and the general public of the room change. The court noted that the act was a comfortable balance of the public's need to know and the performance of the regents' duties without disruption.</SPAN></P>

The court found defendant could be convicted under &sect; 800.281 even though he was an inmate at the time of the offense where he was directly responsible for bringing the contraband into the prison because he employed agents to pick up the contraband and smuggle it inside the prison. The court held there was sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty as a principal where the evidence established that an inmate garbage truck driver knowingly brought whiskey and marijuana into the prison at the direction of defendant. The court determined that the jury was properly instructed on aiding and abetting where the jury was told they had to find a principal guilty of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt before finding defendant was an aider and abettor.

The Board adopted the hearing officer's findings as to acts of immoral conduct, but did not adopt the discussion of defendant's moral character. The Board ordered a 30-day suspension of the physician's license and a three-year period of probation with an order to follow a medical regimen. The trial court reversed the Board's order as to all disciplinary action except for the medical regiment and held that the new &quot;good moral character&quot; should have been applied to the physician. The court reversed and reinstated the Board's decision, holding that Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted under a 1972 amendment to Mich. Comp.

Acts 164, which amended the title of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 800.282. The court found that the method used by the legislature to amend the statute's title was constitutional because the amendment of the law was not merely by reference to the statute's title. There was only an amendment of the title both by reference to and publication of the title. The court determined that the legislature's full statement of the amended title adequately complied with Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 25, which required reenactment and publication. The court stated that because the legislature acted quickly to remedy the defective section, there was no real issue as to notice of the change. The court held that the legislature succeeded in reviving the 1972 amendment through its title amendment in 1977.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant insurer appealed the trial court's order granting plaintiff's motion to enforce its earlier judgment, which held that plaintiff, as her husband's survivor, was entitled to benefits under defendant's no-fault insurance policy, without any setoffs, and as adjusted for cost-of-living increases pursuant to Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3107. The court affirmed the grant of plaintiff's motion. It agreed that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3108, which prior to its amendment made no provision for cost-of-living increases for those surviving the death of family members, created a distinction between surviving accident victims and their family members that violated plaintiff's equal protection rights. While the purpose of both &sect; 3107 and &sect; 3108 was to provide accident victims and their dependents with compensation for lost wages and medical expenses, a legitimate legislative objective, there was no rational relation between that objective and the cost-of-living distinctions. Since plaintiff won on the equal protection issue and defendant failed to appeal the setoff issue, plaintiff was still the prevailing party and entitled to attorney fees under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3148.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of plaintiff's motion to enforce the judgment, holding that Michigan's statutory distinction between surviving accident victims and their family members with respect to cost-of-living adjustments violated plaintiff's equal protection rights. The legislative purpose for the statute was not reasonably related to the cost-of-living distinctions.</SPAN></P>

The citizens filed an action for a temporary and permanent injunction that prohibited the county from closing its facilities on Good Friday and paying the employees holiday pay. The trial court granted a summary judgment in favor of the county, which the court affirmed. The court held that the list of holidays in Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 435.101 (Mich. Stat.

Further, the action by the county was not constitutionally infirm because the decision to make Good Friday a partial holiday was the result of privately conducted negotiations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed an action against the livestock owner claiming that he allowed the cow to run at large on the highway and that the livestock owner was negligent in not fencing in and restraining the cow.

The court held that the trial court had discretion to join or sever defendants for trial. The court held that a severance was not proper because the defenses of defendant and the codefendant were not antagonistic. The court found evidence that both defendant and the codefendant were at the scene of the crime, identified, and apprehended with the fruits of the burglary.

The court rejected this argument on several grounds. The court agreed with the trial court's holding that it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove the corpus delicti of aiding and abetting independent of defendant's extra-judicial confession where the only thing linking him to the crime was the confession. Next, the court concluded that the trial court had acted properly in finding that defendant's several extra-judicial statements were voluntary.

At the preliminary examination, defendant was bound over on second-degree murder, under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.317, and felony-firearm. After a bench trial, defendant was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and felony-firearm. Defendant appealed and argued that because the trial court found that he did not possess a gun prior to shooting the victim, he could not be found guilty of felony-firearm. The court disagreed, finding that at the time when defendant shot his victim, he possessed a firearm.

The court held that a trial court could allow the amendment of an information at any time before, during, or after trial.

The mother appealed the judgment arguing, among other things, that the judgment should be reversed because of the trial court's awareness of the recommendations contained in the friend of the court's report. The court of appeals reversed the judgment. The law had long been settled that the report of the friend of the court was not generally admissible as evidence except by agreement of the parties. There was no agreement by the parties to admit the report of the friend of the court, and it did not become a part of the record. However, the trial judge indicated that he was aware of the report and recommendation. On the facts of the case, the trial judge should not have considered the report. It was error for the court to weigh, in making his custody determination, any evidence not made part of the record, including the friend of the court report. The trial judge's admitted knowledge of the contents of the report might well have had a persuasive effect in the final determination of custody. Accordingly, the court of appeals vacated the trial court's custody order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder but mentally ill. The trial court sentenced him to life imprisonment with eligibility for psychiatric treatment, if appropriate, and defendant sought review. The court held that the issue of competency to stand trial could have been raised at any time before trial and that defendant could not have been proceeded against until his competency was established. Under Mich. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, the accused had the right to counsel in every criminal prosecution. The court found that the preliminary hearing was a judicial proceeding and found that defendant was entitled to counsel at the hearing. The court held that from now on, where there was evidence of incompetency prior to the preliminary proceeding and defendant's counsel requested a competency determination, the magistrate was required to halt the proceedings and refer defendant for evaluation. The court found that defendant's incompetence was not so severe that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel and further held that the trial court had not committed prejudicial error in denying his motion to delay. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the trial court (Michigan) judgment of conviction for attempting to procure an act of gross indecency in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.338. His principal attack on his conviction claimed that the gross indecency statute was unconstitutionally vague, insufficiently apprising potential offenders of the conduct proscribed. He also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he approached undercover officers and offered to perform fellatio for money. When asked, he said he had no place to go. His defense was that he had been threatened by three other men who had told him to &quot;hustle&quot; some money for them. He was convicted in a bench trial and sentenced to prison. On appeal, he argued that the gross indecency statute was unconstitutional, that he had not offered to perform a public sexual act, and that private sexual acts were not prohibited. The court found that the statute controlled both public and private conduct, despite apparent support for his argument in a prior case. Holding the Dexter application of the Szymanski decision as controlling, the court affirmed. Prior decisions had provided ample warning that defendant's conduct was illegal, whether public or private; thus, he had had &quot;fair warning.&quot; The case on which he unsuccessfully relied, which apparently removed private consensual sexual acts from the statute's reach, reflected doubts as to the values of society and a concern for constitutionally protected privacy rights, but the court found that defendant's conduct was not constitutionally protected.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. The court noted that while a belief that private sexual conduct was not a matter of state concern was not irrational, the statutorily prohibited conduct of which defendant was found guilty was not constitutionally protected and he had been fairly apprised of its criminality.</SPAN></P>

The court found that other than the term &quot;Molotov cocktails,&quot; the information was very similar to the statutory language. The court concluded that all that needed to be proved was that defendants had in their possession any device that was highly incendiary, with intent to use the device unlawfully against the person or property of another in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.211a. The court rejected defendants' argument that the State failed to prove that the &quot;Molotov cocktails&quot; would have exploded. The court held that the State did not have to prove that the confiscated containers were &quot;Molotov cocktails,&quot; nor did it have to prove that they would have exploded. The court held that the statute just permitted a showing that the device was highly incendiary.</SPAN></P>

Admin. Code r. 436.37(2) and 436.39(2) (1977). The Commission found that the licensee had violated the provisions and revoked his liquor license. The court dealt with the issue of whether or not there had to be a showing that the dispensation of liquor by the drink occurred on the licensed premises simultaneously with the proscribed conduct before sanctions could have been imposed against an on-premise liquor licensee under Rules 436.37(2) and 436.39(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A licensee complained that rules prohibiting the issuance of a special license to sell gasoline in municipalities with populations over 3,000 were improperly promulgated in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 24.201 et seq., and the Open Meetings Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 15.261 et seq. The licensee also claimed that the rules denied equal protection of the law to licensees in larger municipalities. The court held that summary judgment was improperly granted because the licensee's claims of improper promulgation were not so clearly unenforceable that no factual development could possibly justify a right to recovery; the fact that the licensee had to meet a strict standard in attempting to establish that it has been denied equal protection of the law did not justify judgment on the pleadings. Although the rules were passed by a legislative committee, the Commission was a proper party defendant where an injunction against their enforcement was sought. The court noted that the circuit court's jurisdiction over a claimed violation of the Administrative Procedures Act was dependent on the exhaustion of administrative remedies by the licensee.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the indecent exposure statute infringed on her First Amendment free speech rights. On appeal, the court held that prosecution for indecent exposure was not beyond the scope of &sect; 750.335a simply because the charged conduct was performed before a theater audience comprised primarily of consenting adults. The court held that the State had valid interests which it could protect by the regulation of commercialized obscenity. In reversing, the court found that exhibitions of obscene conduct that occurred on commercial premises open to adults fell within the State's broad power to regulate commerce and protect the public. The court held that defendant's constitutional argument failed because she had no standing to challenge the facial constitutionality of the indecent exposure statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole two hams from a store. A jury found him guilty of larceny in a building, and the trial court sentenced him. The prosecution filed a supplemental information, charging defendant as a fifth offender after the larceny conviction. Defendant pled guilty to the charge. The trial court vacated his original sentence and imposed a new sentence. The court held that the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;&sect; 769.12, was constitutional. However, the court found that the supplemental information was not timely filed. The information charging defendant with the heist of the hams was filed on March 6, 1979, and he was convicted on June 5, 1979. The supplemental information was not filed until June 7, 1979. The prosecution either knew, or should have known, of defendant's previous convictions before his conviction on the latest offense. The supplemental information should have been filed prior to conviction for that offense. The prosecution advanced no to explain the delay. The fact that defendant was forced to go to trial without proper notice of the subsequent supplemental information and the attendant increased sentence resulted in substantial prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City was located in both Bay and Midland Counties, Michigan. The City sought to annex territory from the Township, which lay in Bay County. The greater part of the proposed enlarged City would lie in Midland County. Two members from Midland County were appointed to sit on the Commission when it considered the proposed annexation. The trial court set aside the Commission's order approving the annexation on the ground that the Commission should have included members from Bay County, not Midland County. The trial court did not reach the issue of whether the Commission used reasonable criteria when making its decision. On further appeal, the court noted that the City was a home rule city and, as such, its annexations were subject to the provisions of section nine of 1901 Mich. Pub. Acts 279, as amended. The court further noted that the Commission's actions were governed by the Michigan state boundary commission act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 123.1001 et seq. The court held that, under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 123.1005, the Commission properly appointed members from the county in which the greater part of the territory to be included within the proposed adjusted boundaries would be located.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The complainant alleged that defendants forced her at knifepoint out of a bar into a house where they engaged in various sexual acts without her consent. The court reversed defendants' convictions and remanded for a new trial upon the grounds that the provisions of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520j(2); Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.788(10)(2), which required that defendants give ten days notice of their intent to use evidence of the complainant's prior instances of sexual conduct, were unconstitutional when used, as here, to preclude evidence of specific sexual conduct between the complainant and a defendant. The court reasoned that the provision violated defendants' Sixth Amendment right to confrontation and that the issue of prior sexual conduct between the complainant and a defendant was relevant to the defense of consent. Because of defendants' improper notice, the trial had court declined to conduct an in camera hearing to weigh the probative value of the proffered evidence against its prejudicial nature.</SPAN></P>

A Michigan trial court sentenced defendant to an indeterminate sentence of eight years to life imprisonment on the armed robbery conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant seized a loaded gun from the complainant's truck. When the complainant returned to his truck, defendant robbed him of his wallet at gunpoint. On appeal, the court noted that defendant was carrying a gun at the time of the robbery. The court found that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b did not require some incident of ownership, but the use of a firearm during commission of the crime. The court further held that the defendant's argument that the firearm was &quot;jammed&quot; so that it did not meet the definition of a &quot;firearm&quot; under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 8.3t was without merit. The court held that operability of a gun was irrelevant for a conviction under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227, carrying a concealed weapon. In affirming, the court held that the same logic applied in the instant case. The court found that the trial court properly instructed defendant of the maximum sentence, life imprisonment, for the armed robbery charge. However, in vacating the indeterminate sentence, the court held that the high end of such a sentence had to be a fixed number under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 769.9, not life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

The employees brought an action against the employment commission seeking a declaratory judgment as to the constitutionality of Michigan Employment Security Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 421.27(i)(2).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the trial court (Michigan), which convicted him of second-degree murder, contrary to Mich.

Laws &sect; 750.227b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was originally charged with felony murder in connection with the robbery, but the jury found him guilty of second-degree murder, as well as guilty of the robbery and firearm charges. On this appeal, the court issued a plurality opinion. The court's members agreed that the second-degree murder and firearm convictions were valid. The judges divided on the robbery conviction with two of the three judges in favor of reversal for differing reasons. The main opinion writer noted that the jury found defendant not guilty of the charge of felony murder while the evidence was clear that the killing took place during the robbery, so that the findings were inconsistent. The writer held that the robbery conviction was invalid as an inconsistent verdict that could not be reconciled. The writer addressed the concurring opinion rationale that the robbery conviction was barred by double jeopardy principles and found that while the rationale might also be valid, the proper ground for reversal was the inconsistent verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was evidence that a robber fled in an automobile and that the complainant gave chase, enlisting along the way the assistance of the police officers who eventually stopped defendant and made the arrest. A gun and the complainant's property were found in the automobile that defendant was driving. One of the arresting officers testified, perhaps unresponsively, that the automobile in which defendant was captured had been stolen at an earlier date. The trial judge immediately instructed the jury to disregard the remark. However, defendant freely admitted knowingly receiving the stolen vehicle, denying the robbery, and asserting that the lesser crime was the reason he had led the police on the chase. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's receiving or concealing stolen property over the value of $ 100. The court found that defendant's reference to the stolen vehicle was a strategic move to explain why he fled the scene of the alleged robbery. Therefore, he entered no objection to the addition of the receiving or concealing count. However, the court found that the two offenses occurred on different days and had no connection with each other, and should not have been joined.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in failing to explain that the two felony-firearm convictions would not run concurrently. The court held that the Supreme Court of Michigan definitively ruled that the felony-firearm statute was constitutional in its entirety. The court also held that upon review of the record that the trial court, the prosecutor, and the defense counsel clearly stated that the felony-firearm convictions would run consecutively. The guilty plea form signed by defendant revealed that he understood that the sentences resulting from the one-armed robbery conviction would run consecutively with the sentences from the other. The court concluded that the felony-firearm statute made it clear that upon a first conviction, there was a mandatory two-year imprisonment, that upon a second conviction there was a mandatory five-year imprisonment, and that upon a third conviction there was a mandatory ten-year imprisonment. Accordingly, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the city ordinances defeated legislative intent expressed by the state Legislature in the Michigan Liquor Control Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 436.28a and comprised an arbitrary economic prohibition to the placing of pinball machines. The court found that the trial court properly based its decision not on preemption, but rather on the economic prohibition fostered by the ordinances. The court also found that the city ordinances gave the city clerk the authority to disapprove a license application if an arcade hall was operated &quot;in a manner generally reputed in the immediate vicinity to be immoral and a menace to the good citizenship of the community, as evidenced by petitions of the affected community&quot;. The court found that the ordinance provision in question did not set forth a standard of conduct which was reviewable. While the court recognized the interest the city was attempting to protect, it concluded that that end could be more narrowly protected by specifically delineating the conduct proscribed, and that the trial court's ruling in this regard was not improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose out of the robbery of a party store by two men. Defendant was identified at trial as being the robber without a gun. Defendant argued that he could not be convicted under the felony-firearm statute because he was not in possession of a firearm at the time of the robbery. The court noted that no language in either the felony-firearm statute or the aider and abettor statute limited the application of one to the other. Defendant contended that the prosecution failed to prove that the firearm was operable. The armed robbery statute did not require proof that a gun was operable. A victim's reasonable belief that a perpetrator was armed was sufficient to sustain a conviction. The prosecutor did not have to prove operability as an element of a prima facie case in a felony-firearm prosecution. Defendant also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. All that was required to support a conviction was that the prosecutor introduce some competent direct or circumstantial evidence as to each essential element of the crime charged so as to support the jury's finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. It was for the jury, not the court, to weigh the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contested the constitutionality of the felony-firearm statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b. The court found that the statute did not violate Mich. Const. art. 4, &sect; 25 (1963) by revising, altering, or amending existing laws without reenacting and publishing them as required. Conviction of both felony-firearm and second-degree murder did not violate the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. Further, the felony-firearm statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The felony-firearm statute proscribed carrying or possessing a firearm while committing or attempting to commit a felony. The crimes that defendants were charged with were felonies. Both were in possession of a firearm at the time of the commission of the offenses. Since neither defendant made any claim that the conduct of which they were accused was constitutionally protected, neither had any standing to raise an overbreadth issue. Defendant B admitted that when he and defendant A were in the alley where they killed the victim, they discovered that the victim's wife was in a car nearby. Defendant B's admission that he killed her because she had seen him supported a charge of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

She entered a guilty plea to the offense of larceny in a building and to being a third offender under the habitual offender act. On appeal, defendant argued that she was denied her guarantees of due process and equal protection under both the state and federal constitutions because the State had charged her with a felony instead of a misdemeanor. The court rejected this argument. The court pointed out that the prosecutor's discretion in charging defendants with a crime had some limits. The court noted that a prosecutor could not exercise his or her discretion in a manner that violated constitutional principles and that courts had limited judicial review power for the correction of prosecutorial abuse. The court found that the prosecutor's charging decision in this case did not unreasonably or arbitrarily discriminate against similarly situated persons. The prosecutor's exercise of discretion was supported by the existence of at least two prior convictions for the same conduct that was charged in this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision by the trial court (Michigan), which convicted defendant of felonious assault, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.82, carrying a concealed weapon, a violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, a violation of Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted two double jeopardy claims on appeal, contending that double sentencing was unconstitutional when imposed for both felonious assault and felony-firearm, and both felonious assault and carrying a concealed weapon. Based upon the exception that there was no double jeopardy violation for dual punishment if each offense required proof of a fact that the other did not, the court found that there was no double jeopardy violation for convictions of felonious assault and carrying a concealed weapon. Carrying a concealed weapon required proof that an accused carried a weapon and that it was concealed on or about his person. The underlying statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227, was enacted to discourage quarreling persons from suddenly drawing and using concealed weapons. On the other hand, felonious assault was an assault, a positive act against another person committed with a dangerous weapon. Its purpose was to discourage assaulting persons from inflicting even more serious injuries upon one another. As these crimes required proof of distinct elements and did not overlap in purpose, there was no double jeopardy violation.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the trial court had been under the mistaken impression that defendants were pleading guilty to an armed robbery rather than to assault with intent to rob. However, the court found this to be harmless, as the facts recited in the trial court record sufficiently established the offenses for which defendants were convicted. The court also found that the felony-firearm statute did not violate double jeopardy. One defendant additionally argued that his mandatory five-year sentence for his second firearm conviction was improper because both convictions occurred on the same day although they had arisen from separate incidents. The court rejected this argument because the language of the felony-firearm statute was mandatory and the rule against the accumulation of multiple convictions on the same day did not apply.</SPAN></P>

R. 785.7 (1963) because the trial court failed to ascertain that the plea was made freely, voluntarily, and understandingly. The court found that the trial court accepted defendant's guilty plea after full compliance with R. 785.7. Defendant argued that he could not be convicted as an aider and abettor of felony-firearm because the requisite element of personal possession of a firearm by defendant was missing. The court stated that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b did not require proof of personal possession of a firearm when used in the commission of a felony. The record indicated that defendant actively participated in the armed robbery by taking a ring and a watch from the complainant while his codefendant held the gun. The evidence was sufficient to give rise to the inculpatory inference that defendant knew his companion was armed with a firearm during the commission of a felony. Defendant's participation in the armed robbery was sufficient encouragement and assistance in the commission of the crime to constitute &quot;aiding and abetting.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his motion. On appeal, defendant argued the state court had lost jurisdiction to try him under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, art. IV (e). The court rejected defendant's argument. The court pointed out that the Interstate Agreement on Detainers was designed to avoid shuttling of defendants back and forth between jurisdictions and to avoid the disruptive effect such transfers would have on a consistent treatment program. In this case, defendant was not being shuttled back and forth between the county jail and a federal prison. Rather, he was held only for a brief time while awaiting his trial. Further, there were no rehabilitative programs offered at either facility, thus, his right to an uninterrupted program of rehabilitation was not infringed upon.

Defendant also claimed that, as an aider and abettor, he could not be convicted under felony-firearm statute where there was no indication that defendant personally carried, or had in his possession, a firearm at the time of the robbery. The court held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227b did not require proof of personal possession of the firearm when used in the commission of a felony. But it had to be shown that defendant knowingly acted or encourages, with the intent to aid, the possessor to obtain or retain possession of or to use the firearm during the course of a felony. Despite defendant's lack of personal, physical possession of the shotgun used to rob the establishment, defendant admitted that he knew that his companions went into the store with a shotgun in order to rob someone.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On July 5th, the car manufacturer terminated a dealer agreement with the car dealership upon 30 days notice and stated the termination was effective August 5th. On July 11th, the Michigan Legislature enacted Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 445.522 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19.856(2)), which required 60 days written notice and cause as a prerequisite for a valid termination. The car dealership obtained an ex parte injunction restraining the car manufacturer from terminating the agreement. After a hearing, the trial court dissolved the injunction, ruling that the statute was not retroactive. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court because it held that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 445.522 (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19.856(2)) applied to the termination of the dealer agreement because the termination date occurred after the statute was effective. The court remanded to the trial court for a determination as to whether the car dealership could show cause to terminate the dealer agreement. The court rejected the car dealership's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because it held that the legislature had the power to regulate the potential inequities between manufacturers and dealers of vehicles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officer was given three suspensions and two discharges for various conduct. The commission reduced the suspensions and upheld the discharge and the trial court affirmed the commission's decision. The court reversed in part, remanded in part, and affirmed in part. The court held that the officer's dismissal for conduct unbecoming a police officer was unconstitutional because there was no notice to the officers of the definition of conduct that was unbecoming and there were no prior offenses. There was no conflict when the prosecuting attorney and the advisor to the commission were part of the same law firm where no prejudice to the officer was demonstrated. Under 1935 Mich. Pub. Acts 78, &sect;&sect; 13, 14, the department was not authorized to suspend an officer; only the commission could lawfully terminate an officer's employment.

The city then amended its ordinance to clarify the definition a basement and exclude it from living space. The court denied the application for the writ. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found it was proper to apply the amended ordinance to the case because it was the law at the time of the decision. The court gave great weight in the equitable mandamus proceeding to the circuit court's finding.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen and others filed an action to enjoin defendant, the Department of Social Services, from operating its client reporting system (CRS) in certain counties, in accord with the mandate contained in &sect; 59 of the annual Department appropriations act, 1977 Mich. Pub. Acts 105. Over the Department's claim that &sect; 59 was unconstitutional, a trial court (Michigan) granted the injunction. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department challenged, inter alia, the trial court's ruling that &sect; 59, which terminated the CRS program after a certain date, absent proof of cost-effectiveness and approval from the legislature, was constitutional. Plaintiffs challenged the trial court's ruling that the Department's promulgation of the CRS qualified for an exemption to Administrative Procedure Act rule-making, under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 24.207(h). In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court first ruled that it would address the parties' claims because, although the appropriations act had expired, &sect; 68 of the new appropriations act, 1978 Mich. Pub. Acts. 401, contained a provision similar to &sect; 59, and thus the issues raised on appeal, while technically moot, were of public significance and were likely to recur. The court then ruled, inter alia, that: (1) the Title-Object Clause, Mich. Const. art. IV, &sect; 24 (1963), was not violated because the challenged provision was directly related to 1978 Mich. Pub. Acts. 401's object, to make appropriations for the Department; and (2) while the CRS did not qualify for exemption under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 24.207(h), it did qualify for exemption under &sect; 24.207(j).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff newspaper filed a complaint alleging that defendant university board of trustees (board) had met on numerous occasions in closed sessions not permitted by the Open Meetings Act (OMA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 15.261 et seq., Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4.1800(11) et seq. The newspaper appealed the decision of the trial court (Michigan) that granted summary judgment for the board.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper alleged that the board had met in closed sessions not permitted by the OMA to discuss topics including a legal opinion regarding closed sessions and audit reports and procedures. The newspaper sought summary judgment, attaching the affidavit of its reporter. The board's answer to the motion alleged that the pleadings were incomplete and that there were genuine issues of material fact, but provided no supporting papers. The board's answer to the complaint admitted that it had met in closed session but maintained that the matters discussed in closed session were exempted from open discussion by the OMA because both were exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 15.231 et seq. (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4.1801(1) et seq.). The court found that the board was not entitled to summary judgment based on the pleadings alone. The record was devoid of any indication outside the pleadings that the audit report might be the subject of a valid exemption under the FOIA. The board failed to show proof of its affirmative defense and the summary judgment could not stand. The court remanded the case for further proceedings in the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded to the trial court, stating that either the newspaper or the board may move for summary judgment. The court required that summary judgment shall not issue for the board unless the affidavits submitted, or the testimony, or in camera inspection of the reports, if any, showed that the board was entitled to judgment.</SPAN></P>

Rather, &sect; 29(2) of the MIOSHA directed the Department to apply to a magistrate for an administrative inspection warrant if access to a workplace was denied. Probable cause in the criminal sense was not required. The probable cause that was required was to be based on evidence of an existing violation or upon a showing that a business was chosen for a search based on neutral sources, that &sect; 29(2) of the MIOSHA was constitutional, and that the trial court properly dismissed the employer's action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner sought review of the judgment from the trial court (Michigan), which upheld a zoning ordinance of defendant city and held that the ordinance was not unreasonable as applied to the landowner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner purchased property that was zoned for single-family homes. The landowner built some single-family homes on the property, but then he began to lose money on the homes that he was building. Because there was no longer a market for the homes, the landowner requested a rezoning of the property. The rezoning application was tabled for four years and then denied. The landowner filed an action claiming that the ordinance was unreasonable as applied to the landowner's property. The trial court upheld the zoning ordinance, but on appeal, the court reversed and remanded. There was no evidence that any responsible person would have been able or willing to develop the land with single-family homes; therefore, under the present ordinance there was no means to develop the raw land. The landowner should not have been required to pay taxes on the property, as he had for several years, without any opportunity to use or develop the land. The ordinance, in effect, was taking from the landowner the use of the property without just compensation in violation of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, enjoined the city from enforcing the unconstitutional classification, and remanded the matter to the appropriate municipal zoning authority with instructions to present to the appropriate reviewing court an adopted amended ordinance comporting with the dictates of equity as well as the requirements of constitutional reasonableness as applied to the landowner's property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners operated an establishment licensed to sell liquor in which they permitted nude dancing. The Commission adopted Rule 436.37, which prohibited on-premises licensees from allowing nudity or performing explicit sexual activities on the premises. Subsequent to the adoption of Rule 436.37, the owner continued to permit nude dancing, and a complaint was issued against the owners for violating Rule 436.37. The owners filed a complaint for declaratory judgment that Rule 436.37 was unconstitutional. The trial court found that Rule 436.37 was a valid exercise of the police power. On appeal, the owners argued that nude dancing, when not performed in an obviously obscene manner, was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that Rule 436.37 was not facially violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. A distinction existed between statutes that censored dramatic performance in the theater and statutes that only prohibited such exposure in places where liquor was sold. Thus, the State could prohibit nude dancing in places where liquor was sold.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff subdivision developer appealed an order from the Livingston County Circuit Court (Michigan), which dismissed its complaint against defendant Livingston County Road Commission. The trial court held that the Subdivision Control Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 560.183 et seq. allowed the Road Commission to require a developer to make improvements to a county road outside the subdivision as a condition of subdivision plat approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer challenged the power of the Road Commission to compel it to regrade a portion of a county road as a condition for approval of its subdivision plat. It asserted that the Commission's action deprived it of property without due process of law. The trial court found that the Subdivision Control Act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 560.101 et seq. empowered the Commission's action. On appeal, the court held that the statute did not limit the Road Commission's exaction power solely to improvements on roads within the proposed subdivision as a condition of plat approval. The court adopted the rational nexus test for determining the constitutionality of off-site improvements as a condition for plat approval. The evidence established a rational nexus between the subdivision and the hazardous traffic intersection where the Commission ordered the regrading. The hazardous condition was a direct result of the development of the subdivision. In view of this relationship, the Commission's exaction, that the developer regrade a hill on a county road outside the subdivision, was a legitimate exercise of the state's police power which furthered the public health, safety and welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that allowed the Road Commission to require a developer to make improvements to a county road outside the subdivision as a condition of subdivision plat approval.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant broke into the victim's house, jumped on her bed, grabbed her wrists, and stated his intention to engage in sexual intercourse with her. After a further struggle he left the room and was while exiting the house. The court affirmed his conviction for breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny and assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct involving sexual penetration. There was no error in the admission of defendant's prior conviction of attempted breaking and entering for impeachment purposes as the ruling indicated that he was aware of his discretion and that he believed the prior offense was probative of defendant's lack of credibility. The trial court erred in requiring the prosecutor to specify the theories of first-degree criminal sexual conduct under which he was proceeding. In requiring the prosecutor to designate a theory of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, the trial court incorrectly read subsection Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.520g(1); Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.788(7)(1), as requiring an intent to commit criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the property owner's arguments and affirmed the trial court. The court first noted that the trial court had applied the proper standard of review to the government unit's denial of his request for a zoning variance. The record also showed no systematic exclusion of sanitary landfills by the governmental unit as a minimal review of the record below showed that sanitary landfills were possible within the governmental unit's boundaries. The court also found that the property owner, although he had a state permit, was still required to obtain a license from the local governing body.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were assessed use taxes for the exhibition of non-copyrighted &quot;adult films.&quot; They paid the taxes under protest and instituted suit for a refund, arguing that the disparate treatment between copyrighted and non-copyrighted films violated equal protection. The trial court agreed, but concluded that the violation necessitated striking down the exemption for copyrighted films rather than applying it to all films. Thus, the equal protection violation did not relieve the taxpayers of their liability. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the taxpayers were liable for the payment of use tax under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 205.94(o) (Mich. Stat. Ann. &sect; 7.555(4)(o)) and that equal protection was not violated under the Use Tax Act. Exempting copyrighted films from the use tax tended to promote originality and advanced knowledge. It also promoted the development of a centralized body of information relating to the ownership of motion-picture films. Neither of the grounds were refuted by plaintiffs. The distinction between copyrighted and non-copyrighted films was supported by a rational basis and comported with the requirements of the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with carrying a concealed weapon in violation of Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 750.227. Defendant sought to suppress the evidence obtained in the pat-down search. The trial court denied the motion to suppress and defendant was convicted as charged. On appeal, defendant conceded that the original stop was legal, but argued that the stop and frisk exception did not justify the warrantless search because there were no specific and articulable facts from which the officer could have reasonably concluded that defendant was armed. Where an officer stopped a hitchhiker on a freeway in violation of state law and, in lieu of issuing a citation, intended to transport the hitchhiker off the freeway, the police officer was permitted to have conducted a pat-down search for weapons prior to having the hitchhiker enter the patrol car.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed from the decision of a Michigan circuit court that reversed defendant's conviction for unlawfully displaying an emblem or insignia on a motor vehicle on the ground that the statute under which defendant was convicted, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 430.53, was unconstitutionally broad on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 430.53 by displaying the emblem of an organization on his car when he was not a member of that organization. Defendant's conviction was reversed on appeal. The court affirmed. The court noted that this case dealt with a type of &quot;pure speech&quot; in that the statute attempted to control the content of certain displays on automobiles by imposing criminal penalties. In such cases the State was required to demonstrate a compelling state interest in regulating the content of the &quot;speech&quot; before such regulation could be upheld. The court observed that the statute did not limit its application to attempts to defraud or gain improper advantage from use of an organization's emblem or insignia. Its ban was absolute without reference to intent or purpose. Every display on a vehicle owned by a nonmember subjected the owner to fine and imprisonment. The court found that this was improper. The statute was invalid on its face as overly broad in that it did not even attempt to differentiate between legitimate and nonlegitimate use of an organization's emblem or insignia but, instead, made membership in the organization its sole test.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court granted the union's motion for summary judgment without taking evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed but modified the decision. It held that a trial was not required before enforcement of the award. The circuit court could enforce the award after the city had an opportunity to raise the appropriate objections, it had an opportunity to review the arbitration record to determine if the questions decided were within the jurisdiction of the panel, and the award was supported by competent, material and substantial evidence. However, the circuit court erred in ordering the enforcement of the education incentive provision as the panel had rejected both parties' proposals. The layoff clauses were not beyond the authority of the panel. It gave the city additional rights and did not restrict the city's basic legislative choices. The procedure for selecting the arbitration chairman did not deny the city due process.</SPAN></P>

The parties filed a stipulation of facts regarding the mother's marriage to the other man and the father's non-access to the mother during a certain period of time. The mother and the other man were divorced, the judgment making no reference to children. The trial court denied the father's motion for rehearing and for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the Act was operative where the mother of the child was not lawfully married to the father of the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs sought to recover personal protection insurance benefits as survivors of the deceased accident victim. Defendant insurer alleged that it was entitled to deduct Social Security benefits paid to plaintiffs from the survivors' benefits owed to plaintiffs by defendant under the no-fault act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3109(1), and that it was entitled to reimbursement from the amount paid to plaintiffs by the dramshop defendants under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3116. The other issue to be decided was the amount of survivors' benefits owed to plaintiffs by defendant under the no-fault act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3108. The trial court found that Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 500.3109 was unconstitutional and that defendant was not entitled to a setoff for Social Security benefits. On review, the court held that both statutes were constitutional, thus, defendant was entitled to setoff the social security benefits. However, defendant was not entitled to setoff the dramshop recovery because Mich. Comp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger was on one of two motorcycles involved in an accident with a car. The car driver settled with both motorcycle drivers and their passengers for the limit of her insurance policy. In return, the motorcycle drivers and passengers executed full releases. At the time of the release, Michigan had a guest passenger statute,&nbsp;Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 257.401 (Mich. Stat.

The guest passenger statute was found unconstitutional and the passenger brought a negligence action. The trial court found that the release covered this situation and prevented the passenger's suit. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the theory of mutual mistake was not applicable because the parties knowingly waived other claims. The court discussed cases where previously unknown injuries allowed a plaintiff to bring a claim despite a release but distinguished this case which did not have previously unknown injuries, but, at most, had previously unknown claims.

The deed containing the reservation was recorded and, about two years later, a fire destroyed the county's register of deeds. The transferees rerecorded the deed about 17 years later. The transferor deeded the mineral rights to the grantee and retained a life estate. About six years after the transferees rerecorded their deed, the transferor and grantee filed an action to quiet title to the property. The trial court issued a judgment quieting title to the transferor and the grantee on the basis that the dormant minerals act, Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 554.291, did not operate upon the deed reservation of a fee interest and that the oil and gas interests had not been abandoned. The court reversed that decision. The court held that the act was applicable to any interest in oil or gas, not just oil and gas leases. The court found that the transferees' rerecordation of their deed under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 561.4 did not toll the operation of the 20-year period under the dormant minerals act. The court concluded that the transferor's and grantee's interest in the oil and gas had been abandoned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following collective bargaining negotiations, the employees were laid off by the employer.

On appeal, the court noted that to conclude that the legislature could never vary a circuit judge's term and yet still require that they adhere as closely as possible to a system wherein one-third of the circuit court judges in a particular circuit were elected every two years would be counter-productive. The court concluded that Mich. Const. art. 6, &sect; 12 did not require that a circuit judge invariably hold office for a term of six years. The court held that to the extent necessary to achieve a system wherein, as nearly as possible, one-third of the judges in a particular circuit were elected every two years, the legislature was authorized to alter the duration of a circuit judge's term from the normal six years.

The court disagreed and affirmed the convictions, holding that: (1) defendant admitted he shot at an intended victim, intending to hurt him but not to kill him; (2) this was the requisite mens rea of the crime of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder; (3) while all charges arising out of a single transaction were required to be tried at one time, defendant, by a single act, could be found guilty of multiple offenses; (4) the trial court informed defendant that he was charged with assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder; (5) defendant replied affirmatively when asked whether he understood the charge and the nature of the charge; thus, (6) the judge properly complied with the allocution requirements despite the fact he requested the defendant state the facts before reading his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff board of education appealed an order of a Michigan circuit court, which dismissed the truancy proceedings. The circuit court also reversed the probate judge's denial of defendant student's motion to dismiss the board's petition. The board asserted that the student had been truant from school and therefore should have been determined to be a juvenile delinquent under Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 712A.2(a)(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student's motion to dismiss the board's petition was first denied by a juvenile court referee. A probate judge in the juvenile division upheld the referee's denial. On the board's subsequent appeal to the instant court, the sole issue was whether the student's attendance in school was required by law. The circuit court interpreted &sect; 712A.2(a)(4) as only conferring jurisdiction over children who are &quot;being required by law to attend school.&quot; The circuit court then determined that no statute specifically required a child to attend schools. The court reversed, finding that &sect; 712A.2(a)(4) gave the juvenile division of the probate court exclusive jurisdiction over any child under 17 years of age who was wilfully and repeatedly absent from school. The compulsory education statute that was in effect at the time was Mich. Comp. Laws &sect; 340.731, which required that parents send their children, between the ages of six and 16, to school. The court noted that it would be unreasonable to hold that the legislature intended to require parents to send their children to school without a requirement that the children must attend. Accordingly, the student's attendance in school was required by law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporation commenced an action seeking injunctive relief against defendant township and declaring invalid a township ordinance regulating disposal of sludge contrary to a permit held by the corporation. The Washtenaw County Circuit Court (Michigan) determined that the township could not prohibit the activity of the corporation once the state had licensed it in a properly zoned area. The township appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that it held a permit issued by the state and that the local township could not vote to terminate it. The township contended that the ordinance regulating the disposal of sludge was approved by a properly constituted body, which unanimously voted to terminate the disposal permit held by the corporation. The court found that although the ordinance provided that a license would be granted only if a proposed activity would not pollute significant natural resources, the record did not indicate exactly what factors were considered and resolved when the decision was made to issue the state license to the corporation. The court held that to the extent that the ordinance allowed the township to deny a permit based upon factors previously determined by state authorities, it was invalid. However, the court held that it was unable to determine all the factors under the ordinance for lack of evidence. It therefore remanded to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the ordinance was invalid to the extent it permitted the township to deny the corporation's activity, but remanded for the determination of the factors prescribed in the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
