This appeal arises from action commenced in the District Court of Oklahoma County by the Police Pension and Retirement Board of Oklahoma City, seeking declaratory relief to cease pension benefits of Fred Weed pursuant to 11 O.S. 1971 &sect; 541(p) and Oklahoma City Code &sect; 2-342 (1970). The district court held the statute and ordinance, purporting to divest Weed of his pension benefits based on his felony conviction, to be unconstitutional..  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a city's police pension board of trustees, sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which held that Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 541(p) (1971) and Oklahoma City, Okla., Code &sect; 2-342 (1970), which purported to divest appellee retired city employee of his pension benefits based on his felony conviction, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the employee retired, he began receiving his pension. He was then convicted of conspiring to distribute a narcotic controlled substance. The board requested that the trial court terminate the employee's pension benefits under Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 541(p) (1971) and Oklahoma City, Okla., Code &sect; 2-342 (1970). The court affirmed the trial court's holding that the statute and ordinance were unconstitutional under Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 15, which provided that no conviction would work a forfeiture of estate. Once the employee qualified for his pension, it became a vested property right. Nothing in the record showed that his pension benefits were obtained by or acquired in pursuance of illegal activity; the felony conviction occurred four years after retirement. The employee's vested right to his pension could not be forfeited as a consequence of his felony conviction.</SPAN></P>

McDanel, Judge.  Appellant questions the validity of the denial of his requested relief in the District Court of Cleveland County. In that proceeding appellant attacked the Department of Corrections' reclassification of the prisoner as a security risk not eligible for incarceration in a minimum security facility by virtue of a past escape. It is contended this action, taken under Corrections' rules instituted after the escape, violate constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws.  </SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that such action violated constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant escaped from a state correctional facility. He was later convicted of such escape. Subsequently, Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 510 (Supp. 1983) was enacted, which authorized the Department to enact rules and punishment for recalcitrant prisoners. Pursuant to &sect; 510, the Department instituted a new security risk rating scale. Under such scale, appellant was reclassified as a security risk and deemed ineligible for minimum security incarceration. Appellant sought post-conviction relief, arguing that such action violated constitutional prohibitions against ex post facto laws. The trial court denied relief. On appeal, the court initially noted that the prohibition against ex post facto laws was intended to secure substantial personal rights against arbitrary legislation and not to limit legislative control of procedures that did not affect matters of substance. The court then held that appellant did not have a substantial personal interest in the place of his confinement. Whatever deprivation he experienced after the change in security status did not encroach upon his liberty interest; such interest was extinguished to the point that the State could confine him where it wished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff construction company presented a certification order requesting clarification of Okla. Stat. tit. 51, &sect; 24.3 (1981) after the Oklahoma Attorney General issued an opinion advising the defendants Oklahoma Department of Transportation and its officers that the construction company, pursuant to &sect; 24.3, could not continue to work under an existing construction contract with defendants, the state and the department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the clear, unequivocal, and unambiguous language of Okla. Stat. tit. 51, &sect;24.3 (1981), was to prohibit certain felons from making sale of real or personal property to the state or any political subdivision thereof. There being no contrary indication from the language of the statute, the court held that it was the sale of real or personal property that is debarred. The court held that upon applying the word &quot;sale&quot; as used to the statute, a highway construction contract did not constitute a &quot;sale&quot; and was therefore not within the prohibition of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that the provisions of the statute did not apply to the construction company's contract because it encompassed contracts for the sale of goods and the contract the construction company had been maintaining with defendants was a construction contract, which was a contract for services.</SPAN></P>

Two questions of law have been certified to this Court by the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma pursuant to the State's statutorily provided procedure therefor. The questions involve the constitutionality of the repeal of certain portions of retirement acts of public employees which reduced the benefits provided by those acts. The questions involve two classes of employees; those whose rights to the benefits had &quot;vested&quot; or &quot;accrued&quot; prior to the repeal of the act, and those employees whose retirement benefits had not vested in them prior to the effective date of the repeal.  Certified Questions Answered.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two questions of law were certified to the court by the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma regarding the constitutionality of the repeal of Okla.

Laws 143, &sect; 8 repealed those two statutes The public employees were of two classes; those whose rights to the benefits had &quot;vested&quot; or &quot;accrued&quot; prior to the repeal of the act, and those employees whose retirement benefits had not vested prior to the effective date of the repeal. The district court certified two questions to the court. In response to the first question, the court decided that those employees who had retired or who could have retired and become eligible for payment of pension benefits prior to the effective date of the repeal of the pension provisions acquired a right under those provisions which could not be detrimentally affected by subsequent acts of the legislature. The court noted that no contract existed between an employee and the state, concerning the state pension plan, unless and until the pension vested. In response to the second question, the court found that 1983 Okla. Sess. Laws 143, &sect; 8 was not unconstitutional as applied to the employees who had not become eligible for benefits prior to the effective date of the repeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad was a competitor of the pipeline company who had previously appeared before the commission and opposed the license application.

The court ruled that the railroad company had standing but the order was proper. The court held that: (1) as a competitor of the licensed company, the railroad had standing as an &quot;aggrieved&quot; party; (2) the commission had subject matter jurisdiction over the pipelines because Okla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 34, which defined transportation companies that the commission was permitted to regulate was not exhaustive, but was intended to include new modes of transportation; (3) the regulation of coal pipelines was not pre-empted by congress because the state law did not stand as a obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress; and (4) a joint venture was still a legal entity upon which the right of eminent domain could confer under Okla.

Honorable W. Keith Rapp, Judge.  Appellant landowner originally brought suit individually and as class action against abstract company, claiming abstract company exacted charges in violation of mandatory fee schedule as set forth in 1 O.S. 1981 &sect; 7 (repealed 1984).  Following trial court's direction, landowner added as parties defendant all abstract companies in Oklahoma.  Certiorari was granted to review a certified interlocutory order in which the trial court concluded that 1 O.S. 1981 &sect; 7 was advisory only, and if enforced would be unconstitutional as confiscatory, unreasonable and vague.  JUDGMENT OF TRIAL COURT AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED WITH DIRECTIONS.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner appealed an interlocutory order from the District Court of Pawnee County (Oklahoma), which concluded that Okla. Stat. tit. 1, &sect; 7 (1981) was advisory only, and unconstitutional as confiscatory, unreasonable, and vague. The landowner brought an action against defendant abstract and title company, claiming their charges violated the mandatory fee schedule set forth in Okla. Stat. tit. 1, &sect; 7 (repealed 1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company prepared five abstracts and submitted a bill for fees greater than those set forth in Okla. Stat. tit. 1, &sect; 7 (repealed 1984). The landowner brought an action for a refund of charges exacted by the company in excess of the statutory fee schedule for abstracts ordered and delivered over the past five years. He also sought delivery of the five abstracts upon payment of the statutory charges. The trial court found that the maximum fee schedule established in 1910 was advisory only and its strict enforcement was unconstitutional. If applied to the current abstracting industry, the schedule was vague, economically unreasonable, and confiscatory. The trial court directed the company to calculate its charges for abstracts prepared for the landowner in an amount not to exceed 40 times the charges stated in the statute. The trial court took judicial notice that current movie prices were 40 times what they were in 1910. The trial court then certified the ruling for interlocutory appeal. On appeal, the court held that the statute was mandatory but agreed that it was unconstitutional. The court found, however, that the trial court's comparison to movie prices was inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the part of the order that found the statute that set fees for title companies unconstitutional. The court reversed the part of the order that found that the statute was advisory only and not mandatory. The court reversed the portion of the order that purported to calculate maximum fees based upon a multiple factor of 40 and remanded for a determination of the company's reasonable compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Indian father sought to set aside a decree of adoption on the grounds that the adoption of his son without consent or notice was subject to invalidation under the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA), 25 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1901-1963 and Oklahoma Indian Child Welfare Act (OICWA), Okla.

The court held that appellant did have standing to challenge the constitutionality of Oklahoma adoption statutes that did not require an unwed father's consent, but that U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">CERTIORARI TO THE COURT OF APPEALS, DIV. 4.  In a post-divorce interparental proceeding to terminate paternal rights based upon grounds provided in 10 O.S. 1981 &sect; 1130, the District Court, Lincoln County, Donald E. Powers, Judge, ordered that the father's parental bond with his minor daughter be severed.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Certiorari was granted on the mother's petition.  THE COURT OF APPEALS' OPINION IS VACATED AND THE TRIAL COURT'S ORDER IS REVERSED.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mother obtained certiorari to the Court of Appeals, Division 4 (Oklahoma), which reversed a decision from the trial court that appellant father's parental bond with his minor daughter be severed for his failure to pay child support. The trial court's decision arose in a post-divorce interparental proceeding to terminate paternal rights based upon grounds provided in Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1130 (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dispositive issue on certiorari was whether an involuntary termination of a parental bond might be effected in a private interparental proceeding based on Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1130(A)(4) (1981). The court held that all contests instituted under the Juvenile Code must first be judicially examined or &quot;screened&quot; for &quot;intake&quot; before they were allowed to proceed. The court, sitting in the administration of the so-called juvenile process, functioned as the legally trained discretionary authority charged with the duty of balancing societal interests with those of the child. Because the record was devoid of any evidence of harm sufficient for invocation of governmental intervention, the mother's sole recourse to affect the father's status vis-a-vis his child lay either in a private action countenanced by Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 9 (1981) or in an adoption without his consent under Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 60.6(3) (1981). The court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1130 (1981) grounds were not invokable in a private suit by the custodial parent who sought termination of parental rights of the noncustodial parent. Thus the court answered the question in the negative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the opinion of the appellate court. The court reversed the trial court's termination order without prejudice to the mother's post-remand institution of a suit or to her joining in a proceeding to terminate the paternal bond in an adoption to be effected without the father's consent.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the Board's decision, the court held that the Board had discretion as to whether or not to issue the certificate and that it did not abuse its discretion or act in an arbitrary or capricious manner by not issuing the certificate. The court rejected the bank's contention that it was denied equal protection under the laws because a rational basis for the differential treatment accorded the bank existed in that such treatment furthered legitimate state interests as set forth in Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question presented on appeal was whether bonus money was required to be paid to owners of unleased mineral interests when a forced pooling application was dismissed at the request of the moving party when drilling operations had proven the land concerned would not produce hydrocarbons. The mineral owner contended that the commission erred in sustaining the oil company's motion to dismiss without providing compensation for damages caused by the oil company's delay in the pooling application proceedings. Specifically, the mineral owner asserted that during the period of conversion his property rights were held captive and that the lease value of his mineral rights dropped precipitously. The court sided with the position of the oil company because the pooling application was not sufficiently delayed to deny the mineral owner of the fair market value of his drilling rights. Further, the mineral owner made no effort to lease his mineral rights to others during the pendency of the pooling application although the he was permitted to do so and had done so in the past.</SPAN></P>

Appellee claimed that appellant's conduct was for the purpose of lessening competition and that it irreparably injured appellee. Lower court granted appellee's motion for injunctive relief to restrain the retail sale of gasoline below cost. On appeal, appellant contended that the sale of gasoline could not be said to constitute the sale of merchandise within the meaning of the Oklahoma Unfair Sales Act (Act), Okla. Stat. Tit. 15, &sect;&sect; 598.1 et seq. (1981). Alternatively, appellant urged that the Act was unconstitutional as applied to the sale of gasoline. The court held that gasoline was one of the ordinary commodities of trade and therefore constituted &quot;merchandise&quot;. The court asserted that the state had authority under its exercise of police power to fix prices or place regulatory controls on business and the Act did not contravene U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Okla. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 2, 7. Therefore, the order of the trial court for permanent injunction against appellant was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court stated three factors for ascertaining when retroactivity of a new pronouncement should be restricted: (1) the decision must have established a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent or on an issue of first impression whose decision was not clearly foreshadowed; (2) the reviewing court must weigh the merits of applying the rule retroactively by considering its prior history, purpose and effect, and whether retroactivity would further or retard its operation; and (3) the reviewing court must consider the inequity flowing from retroactive application.

The inmates' 20 percent prison accounts were conditional credits of potentially accessible funds, not vested property interests. The court held that prison officials had a legitimate goal of providing the inmate with funds upon his release to assist him in readjusting to society.

Stat. tit. 28, &sect; 153 (1981). He subsequently filed an action under the Act requesting the trial court to declare the statute in question unconstitutional. The trial court ruled that appellant should have raised the question of the constitutionality of the court costs statute at the trial level in the traffic case. Because he failed to do so, he could not use the Act to raise the question at this later date. The trial court sustained appellees' motions to quash for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and dismissed the case. Upon appeal, the court affirmed the order. The purpose of a declaratory judgment was to declare rights not theretofore determined and was not to determine rights previously adjudicated. Furthermore, the court held that court costs must be litigated in the action in which they were taxed and not in a subsequent suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents, whose minor son died from injuries incurred while working on an oil and gas drilling rig, contended that they were not limited to workers' compensation benefits. Alleging the employer's negligence and reckless disregard for the son's safety, the parents claimed wrongful death under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1055 (1981). The court found that the parents could recover as heirs-at-law if they sustained pecuniary loss under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 22.9 (1981). The court pointed out that under the constitutional amendment, the legislature did not destroy a wrongful death action, but it limited the amount. The court explained that the amendment's valid purpose was to allow the legislature to limit the pecuniary loss that could be recovered by those taking action under the wrongful death statutes for deaths covered by the Workers' Compensation Law. The court concluded that because a limitation was explicitly recognized by the provision on which the parents relied, they did not meet their burden of showing that a legislative enactment was unconstitutional in the face of a presumption of validity under Oklahoma law, and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

Honorable William Bliss, Trial Judge.  This is an appeal from an order confirming the sheriff's sale of an oil and gas lease.  The trial court confirmed the sale after determining that because the lease was personalty, the sale was subject to less stringent statutory guidelines.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant leaseholder appealed the order of the District Court of Muskogee County (Oklahoma), confirming the sale of its oil and gas lease pursuant to plaintiff judgment creditor's execution and subsequent purchase of the lease, classified as personalty, for $ 500 as opposed to the contended value of $ 45,000. The sale had been conducted pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 764 (1981) that required two-week publication notice of the sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the property had been advertised as a sale of lands and tenements, the creditor failed to comply with the law requiring that a bid on such realty was required to amount to two thirds of the appraised valuation. Thus, the leaseholder asserted a failure to follow proper statutory authority, voiding the sale. Although it reversed the district court judgment due to the constitutional insufficiency of notice by publication for such sales, the court held that the lease conveyed an estate in the realty, but was not itself realty within the meaning of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 706 (1921). Instead, the lease was properly classified as chattels real and was, therefore, personal property. However, decrying the inability of &sect;&sect; 757 and 764 to provide the personal notice required by constitutional due process concerns, the court determined that Uniform Commercial Code, Okla. Stat. tit. 12A, &sect;&sect; 2-706(3), 9-504(3) (1981) required that the leaseholder be properly notified of the sale. Further, the court held that failure to afford personal notice to one who held a security interest, such as the leaseholder, resulted in an unconstitutional exercise of jurisdiction as to such interest holders.</SPAN></P>

In two proceedings before the Oklahoma Water Resources Board, mineral lessee was denied standing to seek either a special or a provisional temporary groundwater permit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mineral lessee sought review of a judgment entered in the District Court, Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which dismissed the lessee's appeal from the Oklahoma Water Resources Board's denial of the lessee's application for a provisional temporary permit to withdraw groundwater from the land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee's application for a provisional temporary permit for groundwater use was denied on the ground that the lessee had not obtained permission from the surface owner to withdraw the water and thus did not have standing to seek a permit under the Oklahoma Groundwater Law, Okla. Stat. tit. 82, &sect; 1020.1 et seq. (1981). The lessee's request for a special permit was denied for the same reason. The district court dismissed the lessee's appeal from the denial of his first application and affirmed the Board's denial of his second application on the basis that the decisions were correct. On further review, the court ruled that lessee's first appeal was from a non-final order so that the district court should have dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction rather than on the merits. As to the second appeal, the court ruled that the lessee had a proprietary interest in the reasonable non-domestic use of groundwater that was sufficient to place the lessee in the category of &quot;owners&quot; within the meaning of Okla. Stat. tit. 82, &sect; 1020.11(D) (1981) and could not be precluded from obtaining a permit for lack of standing.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the district court's judgment affirming the Board's denial of the lessee's application for a special permit.</SPAN></P>

Appellants claimed that the trial court erred in sustaining the validity of the prior orders and in approving the payment. The court affirmed. The court first determined that its prior decision that appellants were contingent beneficiaries was the law of the case and that the decision was binding because it was not palpably erroneous and it did not result in manifest injustice to the parties. The court also determined that the fact that not all of the contingent beneficiaries were served with process in the prior proceedings did not affect the validity of the orders because the contingent beneficiaries were not necessary parties under Okla.

The gas company appealed and the court reversed the appellate court with directions to dismiss the oil company's cause of action for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.

The creditor refiled the judgment in Oklahoma under the Act in 1982. The trial court granted the debtor's motion to quash interrogatories and held that the refiling had not revived the judgment. The creditor appealed all rulings, asserting that the trial court erred in finding the judgment dormant and that it had a right to revive the judgment. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that under the Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 721, a foreign judgment was treated as if it had been rendered in the state of filing for purposes of enforcement. The judgment filed from a longer running state followed the shorter term of the state of filing. Thus, the rendition of judgment in Colorado started the dormancy period running under the Act. The judgment became dormant because no execution had issued on it within five years of judgment, as Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 735 (1981) required.</SPAN></P>

An appeal from an order of the Corporation Commission granting the request of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation to designate two grade crossings with necessary signal devices and directing the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad, Appellant, to construct and maintain such crossings.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railway company disputed an order of appellee Corporation Commission (Oklahoma), which granted the request of appellee Oklahoma Department of Transportation to designate two grade crossings with signal devices and direct the railway company to construct and maintain the crossings. The issues included whether the order was within the Commission's jurisdiction and whether the order violated the state and federal due process clauses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission asserted jurisdiction under Okla. Stat. tit. 17, &sect;&sect; 81, 82, 84 (1981) and Okla. Stat. tit. 66, &sect; 128 (1981). On appeal, the court pointed out that the statutes had been settled law for more than 60 years. The court rejected the railway company's strained construction of Okla. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 18, 19, 35. The court held that the Commission's exercise of jurisdiction was proper under Okla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 19 given that the construction of railroad crossings related to the railway company's public duties. It made no difference that the road where the crossings were to be placed was laid after the tracks. Requiring the railway company to pay for the crossings was not a taking without due process of law prohibited by Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Nor was there a violation of the equal protection clause. The constitutionality of Okla. Stat. tit. 17, &sect; 82 (1981), which required a railroad to bear the expense of highway grade crossings, was well established. Because the Department did not perfect an appeal by filing a petition in error and failed to object or seek review of an issue before the Commission, it could not obtain affirmative relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the Corporation Commission.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner President Pro Tempore of the Oklahoma State Senate, sought a writ of prohibition and/or declaratory judgment and petitioned the court to review the propriety of an opinion of respondent Oklahoma Attorney General.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The opinion declared the repealing statute unconstitutional absent a showing that it was necessary to protect the actuarial soundness of the firefighters' and police officers' pension systems. In his petition for the writ, the senate president contended that the attorney general had no authority to declare an act of the legislature unconstitutional. The court denied the writ, holding that the opinion was to be considered advisory only and that it was not binding until finally so determined by an action in a district court of Oklahoma. For an opinion finding an act of the legislature unconstitutional to be binding upon state officers prior to judicial intervention was an unwarranted encroachment upon the power of the legislature to determine policy of the law applicable to state government. Such power properly rested only with the judiciary. Moreover, the opinion failed to embrace the basic presumption that an act was constitutional. Also, contrary to Oklahoma law, it placed the burden of going forth on some unnamed forum to prove that the act was necessary for it to be valid.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 82, &sect; 1085.37 (Supp. 1982), challenging the legality and the constitutionality of the sale of investment certificates by respondent, the Oklahoma Water Resources Board, to develop state and local plans for water control and use. Petitioners contended that the bond issue, at Okla. Stat. tit. 82, &sect; 1085.31 et seq. (1981), was forbidden by Okla. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 14, 15.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board passed resolutions accepting bids and authorizing the issuance and sale of investment certificates to provide funding for state and local plans. Under Okla. Stat. tit. 82, &sect; 1085.33, the certificates were not an indebtedness of the State but were special obligations payable solely from the revenues derived from the projects. A revolving fund was created for security and collateral for certificates issued by the Board. The Board was allowed, in the event of default, to transfer monies from the debt service reserve fund to the debt service fund. The court found that the guarantee by the State of the loans to the public entities was an unconstitutional assumption by the State of debts, in violation of Okla. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 14, 15. Thus, Okla. Stat. tit. 82, &sect; 1085.41 (Supp. 1982), allowing for the pledge for collateral or security, violated Okla. Const. art. X, &sect;&sect; 14, 15, as a pledge or lending of the State's credit. The court held that an invalid provision of a statute could not be made valid because of an apparent need for the proposed law. The constitutional restraints were insurmountable blocks to the approval of the Board's bond program.</SPAN></P>

Appellant appeals from the judgment of the district court which determined that he was the father of a minor child in an action initiated pursuant to 12 O.S. 1981 &sect; 1277.2.  On certiorari, the appellant alleges that the Court of Appeals erred in its holding that he had waived the argument that the three-year statute of limitations, prescribed by 10 O.S. 1981 &sect; 83, was applicable; that the court lacked jurisdiction to determine paternity pursuant to 12 O.S. 1981 &sect; 1277.2; and that HLA blood tests are inadmissible in paternity proceedings.  </SPAN></P>

The lower court found the HLA test results, and other supportive evidence sufficient to establish paternity. The putative father was ordered to pay child support and attorney's fees.

The parents of an eighteen year old congenitally deaf woman brought this action to declare their daughter incompetent to manage her person and estate, and therefore in need of supervision.  After a lengthy trial, Special Judge Robert D. Frank found Ms. Polin to be &quot;judgmentally immature&quot;, capable of being manipulated by &quot;artful and designing persons&quot;, and therefore incompetent under 58 O.S. 1981 &sect;&sect; 851-852.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The daughter was 18 years old and was congenitally deaf and she had average to above average intelligence. Her parents were Jewish and raised her in that faith. The daughter became exposed to Christianity and expressed her interest in that faith. Her father forbade her from practicing that faith and, ultimately, the daughter moved away from her parents' home after she insisted on practicing that faith. Alleging that a certain Christian sect was brainwashing her, the parents filed a petition to have her declared incompetent and for guardianship. The trial court found that the daughter was &quot;judgmentally immature&quot;, capable of being manipulated by &quot;artful and designing persons&quot;, and therefore incompetent. On appeal, the court ruled that the case, prompted by familial disagreement, resulted in misconstruction of the incompetency statutes and in an intolerable chilling of the daughter's fundamental constitutional right of freedom of religion. The &quot;artful and designing persons test&quot; was inapplicable in cases when its application invaded the area of personal ideas, thoughts, and beliefs. The &quot;judgmentally immature&quot; standard used by the trial court did not satisfy any test for incompetency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation had entered into a tax abatement agreement with a state official, which was not in accord with Oklahoma law at the time it was made. The legislature had no authority to grant the tax exemption. The corporation sought retroactive application based upon its reliance on the contract and challenged its requirement to pay ad valorem taxes. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that where the legislature was without constitutional authority to grant a tax exemption, then state officials could also not grant the exemption. The corporation was charged with notice of the state constitution and the limitations of public officials, and the court held that it could not rely on assumed authority by the legislature or public officials. The court held that the agreement was void because no public official could constitutionally grant the tax exemption allegedly contained in the agreement. Since the alleged agreement was unenforceable, the corporation was not entitled to the tax relief it sought. The court held that a contract which rested on an unconstitutional statute was itself void and created no obligation to be impaired by subsequent legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Oklahoma Alcoholic Control Board challenged a judgment from the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma), which determined that Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect;&sect; 539, 568 (1981) of the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 502 et seq. (1981) were unconstitutional and directed alcoholic beverages seized thereunder to be returned to appellee restaurant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Incident to the arrest of restaurant employees, agents of the Board and police conducted a warrantless search of the premises and seized 400 bottles of alcoholic beverages. Individual &quot;members&quot; of the &quot;club&quot; labeled some of the bottles as belonging to them. The restaurant moved for an immediate hearing at which the district court held that the bottles were not subject to forfeiture. The district court held that the forfeiture provisions of the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Act were &quot;overbroad&quot; because they permitted seizure of all alcoholic beverages in the possession of one who had violated the open saloon law, rather than limiting seizure to alcoholic beverages which constituted contraband. On appeal, the court held that seizure was limited to those bottles for which there was probable cause to believe they were possessed or used in violation of the Act. An important governmental interest outweighed any temporary loss of lawfully possessed property, justifying seizure of the alcoholic beverages before a hearing. Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 539 (1981) was not unconstitutional for lack of due process in failing to provide for notice and hearing prior to seizure of the liquor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the district court that held sections of the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Act unconstitutional and remanded the cause for action consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

After a careful review of the publications both separately and together, the court found that none of them, nor all of them collectively, stated a cause of action for libel per se. None of the publications charged the attorney with a commission of a crime. Nor did they expose the attorney to public hatred, contempt, ridicule or obloquy, or tend to deprive him of public confidence, or injure him in his occupation within the meaning of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1441 (1981). The attorney's amended petition was demurrably deficient in its failure to aver how the special damages were occasioned. The court held that the amended petition was fatally deficient in allegations of innuendo sufficient to withstand a demurrer. The court further held that all of the publications were clear and unequivocal in their meaning and import and, therefore, immutable to innuendo.</SPAN></P>

General Motors filed a protest with the Oklahoma County Board of Equalization and it denied the protest.  General Motors appealed the denial of its protest to the District Court.

On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court found that trust properties in which private entities held a possessory and contractual interest by virtue of a lease agreement with a public trust as holder of legal title should be subject to ad valorem taxation. The court added that although property that belonged to a public trust should be exempt from taxation under Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 6, the interest the landowner had in public trust property was subject to ad valorem taxation because the landowner was a lessee. The court held that the landowner's property was subject to the taxes in question unless the disputed tax abatement agreement was legally enforceable.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile division of the district court committed custody of the children to the DHS, with authority to place them for adoption. The district court reserved the right to consent to adoption. Two days later the DHS placed the children with the prospective adoptive parents. The court-appointed attorney of record for the children, who was a member of the Public Defender's office, then announced in open court that she and her husband would like to apply to adopt the children. She filed a successful writ of habeas corpus petition seeking custody. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the trial judge was prompted in his decision more by what he perceived to be a usurpation of unauthorized powers by DHS rather than by an objective determination of what action was in the best interests of the children. The court held that DHS Okla.

The court held that whether property should or should not be annexed to or detached from the corporate limits of a municipality was purely legislative. The court ruled that although the courts could have determined whether a governing board had acted within the scope of its legislative authority and whether such action was reasonable or unreasonable, the courts could not have determined whether a petition for annexation or detachment should have been granted and could have been granted without injustice to the inhabitants or persons interested. The court concluded that the determination was purely legislative and that Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 21-107 (1981) imposing such a duty on the judiciary was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The father was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. The father and the mother divorced, and the divorce decree imposed no support obligation on the father.

Over the father's objection, the trial court granted the adoption pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 60.6(3) (Supp. 1974), finding that the father had wilfully failed to provide any monetary support. In reversing on appeal, the court held that the father's meager monthly stipend could not be considered as a resource in gauging the father's ability to contribute. Moreover, imprisonment could not be equated with a wilful failure to contribute to the child's support under &sect; 60.6(3) because the incarceration prevented the father from making any contribution to the child's support. The trial court erroneously relied on the father's incarceration as a ground for dispensing with his consent to the adopt, and the order allowing adoption without the father's consent was contrary to law.</SPAN></P>

Second, the only limitations imposed upon a constitutional amendment under Okla.

Const. art. 5, &sect; 57 was designed to avoid.

The City of Bethany appealed the granting of a zoning ordinance variance to the District Court of Oklahoma County.  The District Court sustained appellant's demurrer to the evidence on the basis that the landowner did not present evidence sufficient to establish a right to a variance.  This action was appealed and the cause was assigned to the Court of Appeals, Division II, for determination of constitutional infirmity allegedly arising from the vague nature of the ordinance and the power of the Board of Adjustment to rule on constitutional objections.  </SPAN></P>

On writ of certiorari, the court of appeals' opinion was vacated and the trial court's decision was affirmed. The court held that the board of adjustment did not have the authority to determine the constitutionality of the ordinance, but the trial court did have such authority. Although the trial court did not state that the ordinance was constitutional, that ruling was implicit in its judgment. The words &quot;building&quot; and &quot;structure&quot; as defined in the ordinance gave fair notice to the landowner that she was prohibited from placing a carport in front of the minimum setback line. Thus, the ordinance was not vague as applied to her. The landowner was not entitled to a variance pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 44-407 (1981) because any hardship was created by her, the hardship was not peculiar to her property, and the variance would impair the intent of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

Clifford E. Hopper, District Judge.  Appellee filed an application to modify award of support alimony granted in divorce decree, on grounds of a substantial change in circumstances relating to need for such support, citing 12 O.S. Supp. 1979, &sect; 1289(D), in that appellant was living in a &quot;private conjugal relationship.&quot; Trial court granted the relief and appellant appeals on grounds of unconstitutionality of the statute and sufficiency of the evidence.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were granted a divorce. The husband was ordered to pay $ 10,000 in support alimony in three payments. After the first payment, the husband filed a motion to modify the divorce decree by terminating the other payments based on the wife's cohabitation, which motion was granted. On appeal, the wife challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 1289(D), which made the voluntary cohabitation with a member of the opposite sex a ground for reducing or terminating support alimony so long as a substantial change of circumstances relating to need for support or ability to support was also proved. The wife also alleged that the trial court erred in finding a substantial change of circumstances and in finding that a private conjugal relationship existed. On appeal, the court affirmed the modification of the divorce decree, reasoning that there was nothing unconstitutional in &sect; 1289(D). The purpose of the statute was not to regulate morality but rather to regulate support maintenance when the need for continued support had diminished or vanished. Absent an abuse of discretion, the court refused to reverse the discretionary decision of the trial court based on the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 16 failed to meet the constitutional standard for procedural due process because it did not address emergency situations, it had no provisions for prior notice or hearing, it failed to establish alternative safeguards for due process, and it was fatally imprecise as to what information was necessary for an alleged creditor to file a claim.

Action by State of Oklahoma to revoke alcoholic beverage licenses for wrongful sales to minors.  Purported appeal as against all defendants below dismissed except McMar General Stores, d/b/a McMar No. 2.  McMar General Stores' Motion to Quash was sustained on the basis that 37 O.S.1971, &sect;&sect; 241, 242 were held unconstitutional under Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 97 S. Ct. 451, 50 L.

The district court sustained the businesses' motions to quash the State's 20 separate actions because a controlling precedent held that Okla.

The court reversed the contested order. The court dismissed the State's petition with respect to all but one of the businesses. The court determined that the State failed to file a petition in all 19 cases within 30 days from the contested order's date. The court found that the one timely filed petition did not include the other 19 actions and only referred to them as separate matters. The court ordered stricken the State's amended petition in error because Okla. Sup. Ct. R. 1.17(a) did not provide for amendment to substitute parties. The court declined to apply the rule so as to contravene the valid time limitation statute of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 990 (1971). The trial court incorrectly found that Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect;&sect; 241-242 (1971) was invalidated by the precedent's declaration that the definition of a minor in Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 245 (1971) was unconstitutional. The court held that the precedent did not affect the validity of Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect;&sect; 241-242 and that it reactivated the definition of a minor in Okla. Stat. tit. 15, &sect; 13 (Supp. 1972).</SPAN></P>

The wife challenged the constitutionality of applying &sect; 1289(D) to a judgment rendered before the statute's effective date. The trial court overruled her special demurrer. The court reversed the order. No language in &sect; 1289(D) either expressly or impliedly indicated a legislative intent to give retrospective effect to the statute.

For the same reason, the employer's failure to object, the trial court's acts of conducting a physical examination of the employee's hand in open court and consideration of a medical report in an improper form, were not reversible errors.

The city denied the landowner's request for a rezoning to allow twice the number of dwelling units, and the landowner filed his action for an injunction. Witnesses for the city testified that the zoning change would increase traffic congestion, noise, and flood danger, but the trial court found that the evidence did not establish that the zoning change would substantially increase these dangers as compared to single-family zoning. The court reversed the judgment. A municipality's legislative action in establishing a zoning classification was controlling if the classification's validity was fairly debatable. The evidence established that either the existing single-family classification or the requested rezoning would have been reasonable. The factors relied upon by the city in denying the rezoning were legitimate concerns, and its action was neither arbitrary nor an unequal exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

The Council's decision was approved by the Board of Health and the corporation did not appeal from either decision. Subsequently, the corporation challenged the regulation in an action for declaratory relief pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 75, &sect; 306 (1981) and obtained a judgment against the agencies.

The court reasoned that &sect; 306 was not intended to allow an aggrieved party to seek a declaratory judgment after an agency's final order had been issued and the time to appeal from that order had expired. The court held that because the corporation failed to timely perfect an appeal from the agencies' order pursuant to Okla.

In granting the writ, the court determined that the issues presented to the district judge fell within the orbit of the Uniform Trusts Act. There was nothing in the Act to exclude a district court's jurisdiction over a trust established for school lands and trusts, despite the fact that the lands were given by the federal government. Pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 60, &sect; 175.23, the district judge had original jurisdiction over the case. Moreover, venue was proper in the county where the trustee resided. If the court did not act to confine the issues properly determinable under the Act, there was a possibility that two trial courts would have entered conflicting decrees in the case. Because jurisdiction was acquired by the district judge, no other court with concurrent jurisdiction was permitted to interfere.</SPAN></P>

In reaching its decision, the court held that proponents' invocation of Okla.

Her contract was not renewed by the board based on the recommendation of the superintendent, who refused to disclose any specific reasons for her nonreemployment. After a hearing, the school board affirmed the superintendent's action but failed to state reasons for its decision. The teacher filed a declaratory judgment action, and the trial court held that the teacher was not afforded due process because of the board's failure to state reasons or disclose the evidence upon which its decisions were made. It awarded damages of $ 1,000.00. It also held that the admonishment statute, &sect; 6-103.2, was inapplicable because the principal had no reason to believe the teacher would be nonreemployed. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the provisions of &sect; 6-103.4 (B) entitled a probationary teacher to a due process hearing and that she be given a general explanation of the basis of a decision. The court also found that &sect; 6-103.2 was not to a condition precedent to nonreemployment and did not apply to the superintendent.</SPAN></P>

The school districts filed an application to intervene as necessary and indispensable parties to the action. On appeal, the court found that Okla.

The public trust admitted as much when it conceded that the school districts received impacted aid from the public trust in the past and were guaranteed a constitutional minimum percentage of the public trust's funds.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An executrix paid estate inheritance taxes, both federal and state. The executrix demanded reimbursement from the bank that was trustee of a trust included in decedent's estate for tax purposes, prior to the disbursement of the trust to the beneficiaries. The trustee requested the direction of the lower court as to how it should proceed. The lower court ruled that under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 825 the state and federal taxes were subject to apportionment and that the trust was required to contribute. The lower court also exempted charitable beneficiaries from contribution. The trustee sought review. On review, the court concluded that the trust beneficiaries rather than the trust should bear the responsibility for payment of the apportioned estate tax. The court also concluded that it should be the responsibility of the executrix to determine the apportioned share of tax, which each beneficiary should pay, and to demand payment of each beneficiary. The court found that the trustee should be responsible only for termination of the trust and distribution of the assets to the beneficiaries.

The citizens contended that the statutes at issue prohibited the commissioners from complying with the terms and purposes of the Oklahoma Enabling Act, which established Oklahoma's School Land Trust. The citizens further asserted that the statutes prohibited the commissioners from complying with the duties imposed upon them as managers of the trust under Okla. Const. art. XI, &sect;&sect; 1, 2, 5. Thus, the citizens argued that the statutes were unconstitutional. The commissioners had an irrevocable duty to manage the land trust under the Enabling Act. The citizens contended that the below-market statutorily set interest and rents was solely for the benefit of farmers and ranchers. The court agreed with the citizens' position. The court held that the State could not use school land trust fund assets to subsidize its highway construction program or to subsidize farming and ranching.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Supreme Court, in Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 209, 97 S. Ct. 451, 50 L. Ed. 2d 397, 414 (1976), declared that Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 245 (Supp. 1972) created an unconstitutional and arbitrary age difference between males and females in defining a minor in relation to the sale of certain types of alcoholic beverages. The State, under Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect;&sect; 241 and 242 (1971), attempted to revoke the alcoholic beverage licenses of the licensees for selling to minors, but the licensees' motion to quash was granted. On the State's appeal the court noted that the trial court's rationale that Craig v. Boren also held that &sect;&sect; 241 and 242 were unconstitutional was erroneous. The court noted that the gender difference only regarded the disparity in the ages of males and females, not the regulation of the sale of alcohol to minors. The court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 15, &sect; 13 (Supp. 1972), which established the age of majority for both sexes in civil matters, was still applicable. The court found this controlling and held that Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect;&sect; 241 and 242 were not unconstitutional and reversed the granting of the motion to quash.</SPAN></P>

The court limited its review of the company's claim of erroneous jury instructions because the company failed to preserve its objections for review. Under this limited review, the court found that the instructions contained no misstatement of law. The court also held that the award of attorney fees was allowed under Okla.

The court noted that every person had the right to drill wells on his own land and take all the minerals that he was able to reduce to possession, subject to the power of the state to prevent waste. The court stated that if the practical recoverability of minerals would be affected by increasing or decreasing the size of a drilling or spacing unit, the Commission could consider such factors as constituting waste. The court concluded that the Commission had properly considered the price of gas upon the economic inducement to produce and properly determined that there was no substantial change of conditions or substantial change in knowledge of conditions since the prior orders were entered.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 87.1(d) (Supp. 1978); and the companies could not complain that the Commission failed to re-space the entire source because they argued for piecemeal proceedings before the Commission.</SPAN></P>

Honorable David M. Cook, Trial Judge.  On February 6, 1981, the District Court of Oklahoma County, David M. Cook, Judge, issued a writ of mandamus in an action brought therefor by plaintiff, below, Grand Lake Association, Inc., an Oklahoma nonprofit corporation, directing the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Commission, Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department, Abe L. Hesser, and David W. Way, Director of State Finance, and each and all of them to immediately approve certain claims submitted by plaintiff for payment under the provisions of Laws 1979, c. 289, &sect; 16, as amended, Laws 1980, c. 268, &sect; 4, from the appropriations provided in 1980 Session Laws, c. 354, &sect; 1 as required by law, and issue the warrants necessary for payment of said claims.  David W. Way, as Director of State Finance, defendant below, appeals.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation filed a suit seeking to compel payment of matching funds under the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Act. The trial court entered a peremptory writ of mandamus directing the state department of finance to pay the claims properly submitted by the corporation from the appropriations as required by law and issue the warrants necessary for payment. On appeal, the state department of finance contended that mandamus was not the proper remedy because there was an adequate remedy at law and that the corporation could not enforce an alleged contractual right by writ of mandamus. The court held that the allowance of payment of the claims under the circumstances was a ministerial act enjoined upon the state finance department by statute. Mandamus was an appropriate remedy under the facts and circumstances. The court found that the appropriation statutes were in the nature of a unilateral contract between an agency of state government and the corporation and therefore not in violation of Okla.

It was written, typeset, cut and pasted, distributed, circulated, and advertising prepared from appellee's production facilities at Piedmont. However, the newspaper, in final form, was taken outside of the county for offset reproduction. Appellee petitioned the trial court for an order declaring it to be qualified to publish legal notices pursuant to &sect; 106, which was granted. Appellants claimed that the act of &quot;reproducing&quot; was synonymous with &quot;printing&quot; and therefore appellee could not qualify to publish legal notices under &sect; 106. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court had held in a 1973 amendment to &sect; 106, that the word &quot;printed&quot; meant more than the simple act of reproduction. The court held that the amendment imposing restrictions on out-of-county printing related only to more substantial, integral, and important components of &quot;printing&quot; rather than reproduction only. Therefore, where the only act done out of the county was the mere reproduction of the finished product, appellee's newspaper was being &quot;printed&quot; within its county for the purposes of legal qualification under &sect; 106.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appeal from the District Court in and for Tulsa County, Honorable Ronald N. Ricketts, Trial Judge.  An appeal from the District Court of Tulsa County, the Honorable Ronald N. Ricketts, presiding, from a judgment and sentence for indirect contempt.  The contempt sentence was issued for violation of an injunction requiring appellant to cease the unauthorized practice of dentistry.  The fine and punishment assessed for contempt under 59 O.S. 1971 &sect; 328.49 were the minimum permissible sentence.  Contemnor brings this appeal objecting to the existence of criminal attributes of the statutory penalty for contempt provided by the legislature for unauthorized practice.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Tulsa County District Court (Oklahoma) that found him guilty of indirect contempt for failing to cease the unauthorized practice of dentistry and imposed a fine and punishment under Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 328.49 (1971).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After it was determined that defendant was practicing dentistry without a license in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 328.49, the district court issued an injunction barring defendant from such further unauthorized practice. When it was subsequently learned that defendant continued to practice dentistry, contempt proceedings were instituted. After defendant was found to be in indirect contempt, the district court sentenced him to 30 days in the county jail and assessed a fine of $ 500. Defendant appealed. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's argument that the contempt adjudication did not serve the purpose of coercing compliance with the injunction where, although he had violated the injunction, he had not violated it within the last five months. An indirect contempt under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 565 (1971), was the willful disobedience of any court order, and defendant's violation of the district court's injunctive order rendered him susceptible to contempt proceedings. Further, Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 25, contained no prohibition against a punitive sentence in an indirect contempt proceeding and did indicate that the district court could only act remedially.</SPAN></P>

She challenged the trial court's order, arguing that the Congressional Act was unconstitutional because Congress lacked power to alter the effect of Okla. Stat. tit. 84, &sect; 44 (1971). The principal beneficiaries contended that all of the issues presented by the wife in the case at bar had been resolved in a previous case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company filed a lawsuit against defendant city seeing an injunction to prohibit the enforcement of an ordinance as well as damages suffered thereby under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The Court of Appeals (Oklahoma), reversing in part a decision of the trial court, held that the ordinance, which restricted by weight traffic on certain streets, was invalid. The city sought a writ of certiorari from that decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company owed a lease for the purpose of mining riverbed sand at the southern end of one of the city's streets. That street was the only route on which the company could transport its mined sand into commerce. The city, however, passed an ordinance that limited the weight of trucks that could travel on the street. The ordinance only affected the company. The court enjoined the city from enforcing the ordinance. The court stated that the ordinance did not bear a rational relationship to the city's concern for health, welfare, and safety. The ordinance would have had the effect of requiring the company to use smaller trucks more often. The problematic threat caused by the sand would remain fixed, but the real health and safety threat, which was the object of the ordinance caused by the increase of the number of trucks, would be proportionately increased. The court noted that the present truck traffic had not damaged the street or violated the city noise ordinance. Thus, the ordinance was beyond the scope of the city's police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court's decision was vacated. The trial court's order, insofar as it denied the company a permanent injunction to restrain enforcement of the ordinance, was reversed. The court enjoined the city from enforcing the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 87.1(e), in order to protect correlative rights and to prevent the drilling of unnecessary wells, required forced pooling if the mineral owners had not agreed to pool their interests or where a separate owner had drilled or proposed to drill a well on the drilling and spacing unit. Section 87.1(e) did not require that a separate owner promise to drill a well, only that the Commission had the authority to order forced pooling if a well was proposed. There was no authority that required the separate owner to bind himself inextricably to drill a well before the unit could be pooled. Second, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the order. Third, the court held that that &sect; 87.1(e) was constitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General (Oklahoma) rendered an opinion that &sect; 175.11 violated Okla. Const. art.

VII, &sect; 2 and due to the public nature of the case, the court assumed original jurisdiction to decide whether &sect; 175.11 violated the state constitution. The court reviewed its past decisions as to the constitutionality of laws similar to &sect; 175.11 under Okla. Const. art. XXI, &sect; 1, which provided that certain institutions created for the public good had to be established and supported by the state. Uniformly, laws requiring that counties assume some of the burden for financing such institutions were held to violate art. XXI, &sect; 1. One such law was quite similar to &sect; 175.11.

The Department asked that a writ be issued requiring various county commissioners and members of various county excise boards to comply with the provisions of that statute. The Department argued that since county ad valorem revenues were only used to pay for treatment provided to each county's residents, the funds were being appropriated and used for a county purpose, and, thus, Okla.

Appellants contended 52 O.S. 1971 &sect; 87.1(b) applied to contractual interests created prior to the effective date of the statute. The trial court sustained appellees' demurrers to the petition and thereafter dismissed the action.  Appellants perfect this appeal.  </SPAN></P>

The property owners sought to have that cloud of title removed pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 87.1(b) (1971). They asserted that &sect; 87.1(b) applied retroactively, but the trial court disagreed and awarded judgment to the oil companies. That decision was affirmed by the court, which noted that legislative intent was of paramount importance in determining whether statutes should be applied retroactively. Absent legislative intent to the contrary, statutes would not be interpreted retroactively where doing so altered rights and duties under an existing contract. The court noted that words alone were not the only decisive factor in divining legislative intent in this regard. Nonetheless, the court held that &sect; 87.1(b) was not meant to be interpreted retroactively. In its decision, the court noted that the passage of &sect; 87.1(b) by amendment to an older act did not necessarily mean that it operated retroactively.</SPAN></P>

The surviving widow and children of Samuel E. Kimery (decedent) brought a wrongful death action against Public Service Company for the wrongful death of decedent.  Decedent was electrocuted when he and his co-worker were painting an industrial building and their aluminum ladder came into contact with high voltage lines owned by Public Service Company.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent was electrocuted when his ladder came into contact with a high-voltage line. His survivors brought a wrongful death action against the electrical utility company. The utility company's defense rested on a claim of ordinary contributory negligence and contributory negligence per se resulting from the decedent's violation of the &quot;six-foot law,&quot; Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 981 (1971). On appeal of a judgment in favor of the utility company, the court affirmed. The decedent was warned of the presence of the high-voltage line. Thus, his survivors could not challenge the alleged constitutional infirmity of &sect; 981 for failing to require the utility company to notify the general public of the presence of the high-voltage lines. The statute was not unconstitutionally vague when measured by the decedent's conduct. Nor was it unconstitutional class legislation in violation of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 51. It did not confer any immunity from tort liability upon electrical utilities. The burden of care it imposed upon the public was intended to promote the safety and welfare of the general public. The trial court's instructions on contributory negligence and negligence per se were proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dispute over the ability to foreclose on a materialmen's lien statement, the primary issue was the constitutionality of &sect; 141 et seq. Appellants claimed that the procedures were valid, while appellees relied on recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions regarding other remedies to argue that they were denied due process under the lien statute. On review, the court found that the trial court erred in finding the statute to be unconstitutional, so it remanded the case for further proceedings. The court concluded that the statutory procedures did not violate due process principles because the mere filing of a lien statement did not entitle a claimant to a lien on the land. The court rejected the claim that there was an unconstitutional &quot;deprivation&quot; from the filing of a lien. The court noted that a landowner was not deprived of substantial use and enjoyment of the property when such a lien was filed, but notice was simply given to all that a pending claim might be enforced against the land. Thus, the court held that under the Oklahoma lien statutes, there was no deprivation of a property right without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The workmen's compensation court held it had no jurisdiction to rule on questions of election, assignment, or subrogation, and on appeal, the workmen's compensation court en banc upheld the award of death benefits and held that there was no right of subrogation under Okla.

The court rejected petitioners' argument that denial of the right of subrogation was an abrogation of their common law right, stating that the right to death benefits under the Act and the right to pursue a wrongful death action were purely statutory rights, neither of which arose from the common law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Despite knowledge of the father's address, the mother changed the surname of the parties' eight year old daughter pursuant to Okla.

On appeal, the father argued that his unsevered parental bond as a non-custodial parent who was paying child support and exercising his visitation rights were in jeopardy if the mother was allowed to summarily change his daughter's name without notice to him. Agreeing therewith, the court reversed the district court decision and held that it erred in refusing to void the decree allowing the mother to change the daughter's name. Basing its ruling on the fact that the father's address was indisputably known when the action was commenced and that the parental bond was an essential right, a basic civil right, a fundamental right, and a personal right more precious than a property right, the court held that the bond was constitutionally protected by the due process and equal protection clauses. However, the court did not declare &sect; 1633&nbsp;unconstitutional. It merely held that &sect; 1633 provided insufficient constitutional notice for a hearing that involved such an important right.</SPAN></P>

In this case, we are asked to determine whether the issuance of an injunction, prohibiting the defendant below from engaging in certain acts deemed to constitute the practice of dentistry, was proper.  In determining this question, we hold that The Board of Governors of the Registered Dentists of Oklahoma has the capacity to bring injunctive actions in order to prohibit non-dentists from performing acts which constitute the practice of dentistry.  Additionally, we hold that neither the placing of a newspaper ad advocating denturism, nor the cleaning of dentures, constitutes the practice of dentistry, as that term is defined in the State Dental Act.  </SPAN></P>

The court found that the board was statutorily authorized to regulate the practice of dentistry and to enforce the statute that regulated dentistry. Therefore, the court found that the board was authorized to bring an injunction action against the technician and declared that the board's existence created no unconstitutional deprivation of equal protection or due process of law. Nonetheless, the court found that the trial court erred when it prevented the technician from publishing an advertisement that it decided had nothing to do with dentistry. Similarly, the court held that the cleaning of dentures did not constitute dentistry within the meaning of Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers sought a refund of taxes erroneously paid through a mistake of law based upon the court's decision that Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1402(a) (Supp. 1979) was unconstitutional. The taxes were paid without protest. The taxpayers claimed refunds under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 227 (1971). In reversing the decision, the court found that Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 227 (1971) could not be construed as precluding a taxpayer from recovering taxes erroneously paid without protest through an error in computation if the claim was timely filed and did not preclude recovery if the claim was based on a mistake of law. Since all the taxes for which the taxpayers sought refunds were paid to satisfy the liabilities which accrued prior to the 1978 amendment of Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 227 (1971), the taxpayers' right to refunds had to be determined under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 227 (1971) prior to its amendment. Under Okla. Const. art. 5, &sect; 54, the repeal of a statute could not affect any accrued right. The taxpayers' payment under a statute that was subsequently declared unconstitutional constituted an erroneous payment through a &quot;mistake of law&quot; under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 227 (1971).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners appealed a decision in favor of defendant roofer by the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma on the roofer's counterclaim for lien foreclosure, attorney fees, and an in personam judgment against the homeowners, which was part of the homeowners' claim to set aside the subcontractor's lien pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 42, &sect; 177 (1977).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners hired the contractor to install a new roof. After having obtained a bid from the subcontractor, the homeowners decided to rip off the old roof themselves to reduce the price. The roofer then put a new roof on the house. When the homeowners refused to pay the roofer because the roof leaked, the roofer filed a subcontractor's lien. The homeowners filed an action to set aside the lien. Although the subcontractor's lien was filed late, the trial court found that the roofer was a contractor for purposes of installation of the roof under Okla. Stat. tit. 42, &sect; 142 (1977) because it dealt directly with the homeowners on the reduced price. The court held that the roofer was a subcontractor because the roofer performed the work through the contractor. Therefore, the roofer was not entitled to foreclose the lien because it filed the lien too late. However, the subcontractor was entitled to damages for unjust enrichment because it installed the new roof at a good faith cost. The homeowners were still entitled to the offset from the damages because of the poor quality of the roof. Because both parties prevailed, both parties were entitled to attorney fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision for the subcontractor and ruled for the homeowners on the lien foreclosure issue. The court affirmed the decision for the subcontractor on the issue of a judgment against the homeowners and affirmed the decision for the homeowners regarding an offset from the award. The court modified the order so that both parties received attorney fees and the cause was remanded to determine the homeowners' attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

The neighbors filed motions, demurrers, and answers challenging the right to a &quot;way.&quot; Before the district court could rule, the landowners dismissed the action without prejudice to future filing and the neighbors moved for judgment on their cross petitions. The district court granted judgment in favor of the neighbors, enjoining the landowners permanently from asserting any further claim. The landowners appealed and the court reversed, dissolving the injunction. The court found that Okla. Stat. tit. 27, &sect; 6 (1971) and Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 23 indicated that an individual had certain rights by virtues of such enactments as to a grant of the power of eminent domain.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General issued two opinions that found that an appropriations bill was unconstitutional because it commingled general appropriations with special appropriations.

The Attorney General argued that the court had no jurisdiction over the Office of Attorney General. The court disagreed and held that it had jurisdiction because the issue was one of statewide concern. The court then held that the constitution contained no limitation or prohibition upon the legislature's power to enact an appropriations bill similar to the one at issue. Mandamus was improper, however, because Okla. Stat. tit. 74, &sect; 18b(q) (1979) required the Attorney General to provide the legislature with opinions when asked. The Attorney General met this requirement. The court therefore chose not to issue a writ of prohibition, but rather determined that the opinions were invalid and of no effect.</SPAN></P>

They were &quot;public officers&quot; within the contemplation of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 133 (1971); as such, the venue of all petitioners was dependent upon the public officers' venue.</SPAN></P>

Relators filed an &quot;Application to Assume Original Jurisdiction and Petition for Writ of Mandamus&quot; seeking to compel the Corporation Commission to comply with &sect; 12 of Enrolled Senate Bill 49 of the First Regular Sessions of the 37th Legislature.  The Corporation Commission, through its staff attorneys, filed a response.  The Attorney General of Oklahoma has filed motions challenging the right of the Corporation Commission's attorneys to represent it in this action, questioning the relators' standing to sue, and to dismiss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed and the governor signed an act that required the Commission to prescribe a method for giving consumers credits on their utility bills. The attorney general rendered an opinion holding that portion of the legislation invalid because it was enacted in violation of the state constitution. The legislators sought by their mandamus action to compel the Commission to comply with the legislation. The attorney general argued that the legislators' action was brought in the name of the state and he was, therefore, the proper representative to bring the action. He argued that he thus represented both parties and sought dismissal of the complaint. The court held that it had jurisdiction of the action. The Commission had a right to counsel of its own choosing. The legislators sought to vindicate an important public right under circumstances where the attorney general could not be expected to represent the interest. They therefore had standing to bring the action. The attorney general's views on the issue were important and should be heard. The court therefore decided to realign the parties.</SPAN></P>

This cause is a consolidation of a direct appeal filed from a decision of the Oklahoma Court of Tax Review, and a declaratory judgment action brought by the Board of Trustees of the Employee Retirement System of the City of Oklahoma City.  On motion of the parties, both causes were consolidated for consideration in this Court.  The question presented in both causes is whether certain sinking fund levies levied by the Cities of Oklahoma City and Lawton violated the provisions of Article 10, Section 26, of the Oklahoma Constitution, which require municipalities and counties to be on a &quot;cash basis.&quot; Finding that the levies did violate the provisions of Article 10, Section 26, of the Oklahoma Constitution, we affirm the ruling of the Court of Tax Review, holding that it should be applied prospectively.  </SPAN></P>

The court determined that it was the intent of the legislature that judgments rendered under the provisions of &sect; 149 could be rendered without proving that the city appropriated funds to pay for the premium debt underlying the judgment. The court held that the levies violated the provisions of Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 26, requiring municipalities to operate on a cash basis. Thus, the fund was under no mandatory obligation to provide services for which the cities made claim. It was necessary for the fund to allege and prove there were funds on hand out of which the claims made against the cities could be paid. The fund's failure to do so was fatal, and the court held that the judgments entered against the cities, based on the fund's claims, were not properly satisfied through a sinking fund levy.</SPAN></P>

After the corporation removed the action to district court, appellant was victorious and sought attorney fees under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1757 (1975). The District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma) denied the application for attorney fees, and held that the act violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation removed the small claims action to district court and lost. Appellant sought attorney fees under &sect; 1757, which imposed attorney fees on losing defendants. The corporation claimed that the unilateral attorney fees clause violated equal protection. The court disagreed, finding that the clause withstood strict scrutiny because it served a compelling public interest. The unilateral attorney's fees feature was triggered by defendants' election to fundamentally alter the character of the lawsuit from a summary, informal small claims matter into a formal, protracted litigation involving greater complications and most significantly, the appearance of attorneys. Defendants' election in such cases served to defeat the unmistakable public policy goal of establishing small claims forums as &quot;peoples&quot; courts, uncomplicated by the formal demands of superior courts. The discriminatory portion of the statute that imposed attorney fees on one party for the benefit of his opponent without granting defendant a corresponding right, did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the law, or Okla.

In an appeal from a judgment of the District Court of Oklahoma County holding portions of House Bill 1484 of the 37th Legislature of the State of Oklahoma unconstitutional as measured against both State and Federal Constitutions, it is held House Bill 1484 neither violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, nor impermissibly encroaches on the Oklahoma Constitution's reservation to the people of the right to Initiative.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act was passed prior to an election on an income tax initiative. The Act was intended to overturn the initiative, however, the initiative failed to pass. The tax classification at issue in the Act taxed a higher percentage of the taxpayer's total cash flow at a lower rate for those not using the federal tax deduction and a lower percentage of the taxpayer's cash flow at a higher rate when the deduction was used. On appeal, the Commission argued that deductions from taxable income were purely a matter of grace dependent upon the legislative will alone. The court reversed the judgment, holding that the Act neither violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, nor impermissibly encroached on the Oklahoma Constitution's reservation to the people of the right to initiative. Additionally, the legislature had the power to create the deduction for federal tax paid. Having the power to create the deduction in itself established two classes of income taxpayers, those using the deduction and those refraining to do so. The classification of taxpayers was rationally related to the end to be achieved, which was the taxation of income.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed on appeal. The court rejected the mother's argument that the notice requirement was unconstitutional. The court held that the notice requirement furthered legitimate state interests by fostering a prompt investigation and opportunity to remedy the problem quickly. The court, however, agreed with the mother's alternative argument that there was substantial compliance with the notice requirement. The court found that the mother had sent a letter to the board president.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailer made a request to the Board to transfer his retail liquor license to a new premises. The Board approved the transfer conditioned on the removal of a beverage mart sign located on contiguous property also owned by the retailer. The Board indicated the large beverage mart sign indirectly attracted customers' attention to the adjacent liquor store in violation of the Board's rules and regulations. The Board issued a declaratory judgment of a violation. On appeal, the trial court reversed the Board's order. The trial court concluded that the rule relied on by the Board was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and that the determination that the sign violated such rule was based upon insufficient evidence. The court reversed the trial court, finding that although the rule could be more precise, it was not so vague and overbroad as to require holding it to be void. Therefore, the rule met constitutional scrutiny. The court did not agree that the Board's ruling was clearly erroneous because photographs of the premises were introduced, the Board's investigation showed a violation, and the retailer did not introduce evidence to refute the violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denturists, technical dentists practicing prosthetic dentistry, claimed that the Board's injunction violated the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 25, &sect;&sect; 301-314 (Supp. 1977), because the decision to seek an injunction against the denturists was not made at an open meeting. The Board claimed that the decision to seek an injunction was a judicial determination, which was not subject to the Act, and was thus properly determined by the Board's attorney and agreed to by a Board member. The court held that the Board violated the Act. As a public body, the Board had to have a public meeting to pass a resolution with votes publicly cast on whether to direct specific action against the denturists. The Board also failed to make and keep minutes from that meeting. The State Dental Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect;&sect; 328.1 - 328.52 (1971), did not unlawfully delegate public power to a private group. The Board had a right to seek injunctive relief under Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 39 and Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 328.49 (1971). The Board members' pecuniary interest in dentistry was not substantial enough to make their enforcement of the Act unconstitutional where the Act limited their powers.</SPAN></P>

The appellants, Tulsa County officials, appeal from a summary judgment in favor of the appellee-taxpayers in their suits for refunds.  The district court held that the Tulsa County Board of Equalization did not have the authority to hear and correct the taxpayers' grievances and that the county assessor had unconstitutionally assessed the taxpayers' property at a higher ratio than that applied to other real property in Tulsa County.

The taxpayers attacked the action of the county assessor in applying different assessment percentages to different categories of property. The court held that the actions of the county assessor in applying to the taxpayers' properties different assessment percentages from the percentages applied to other properties resulted in an unconstitutional unequal burden of taxation. Under the county assessor's system of assessment, there were 10 categories of real property, arguably 14 since four had two sub-categories. Against the value of property in these various categories, eight different percentages were applied to arrive at the assessed valuation, ranging from a high of 25 percent to a low of 6 percent. This was a disparity in tax burdens. Under Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 5, taxes were required to be uniform upon the same class of subjects. Under the county assessor's system, taxes were not uniform upon real property. Real property was one class of subjects. Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 5 mandated that taxes be uniform upon the same class of subjects; that provision was not affected by the 1971 amendment.</SPAN></P>

Although not required to do so under the statute, the Secretary mailed the petition and summons to defendant's service agent, but it was subsequently returned. Defendant was actually notified of the action when it received a notice of taking a deposition. The trial court found personal jurisdiction because service had been rendered as required by &sect; 1.204a. The court found that the judgment was void for want of jurisdiction. Further, &sect; 1.204a was constitutionally impermissible because it allowed a judgment to be rendered without service of process upon an undomesticated foreign corporation and because it was not reasonably calculated to apprise defendant of an impending action. Defendant had not entered into a series of acts constituting &quot;doing business&quot; so as to invoke domestication status.

He claimed that the tenants violated their lease by failing to pay him excess rent based on the volume of their business, to keep the premises free of debris, and to refrain from subleasing any portion of the premises. The landlord filed his forcible entry and detainer action against the tenants and demanded the amount of the excess rentals he claimed were owed. The tenants filed various counterclaims and a jury demand, all of which the landlord moved to dismiss as being not permitted under the entry and detainer statute. The trial court granted the jury demand and ruled that most of the counterclaims could proceed in the action. The landlord filed his petition for a writ of prohibition against the trial judge. The court noted that the forcible entry and detainer action expressly provided for the right to jury trials. The statute, however, prohibited the assertion of any counterclaims that were not specifically permitted by it. The purpose of such actions was to determine quickly the right to possession of land. The matters raised by the tenants had to be addressed in a separate suit.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that, where the constitution and laws exempted from taxation all property of municipalities within the state, without reference to the use to which the property was put, it was exempt from all taxation regardless of the character of the use thereof.

The court determined that freedom of speech could not be made subservient to any definition of beauty or aesthetics that the state offered for not permitting billboards in rural locales. The court rejected the state's contention that the restriction on billboards was in the interest of the health and safety of the motoring public. The court concluded that the manner and place restrictions imposed upon the citizen's speech activity had little if any relationship to the legitimate governmental purpose to be served by the legislation.

The mother's confinement in a mental hospital, while necessitating custody of a child being placed elsewhere, did not constitute failure to give the child the necessary parental care or protection required for his mental or physical health within the purview of Okla.

Finding that under the Rules promulgated by this Court in Creating and Controlling the Oklahoma Bar Association, the Petitioners have the right to practice law within this State without the imposition of conditions such as association with resident attorneys and operation of an in-State office, we issue the Writ of Mandamus requiring the Respondent Trial Judge to permit the Petitioners to practice within the First Judicial District of Oklahoma.

The mother contended that Oklahoma's provision for adoption of children born out of wedlock was unconstitutional since it deprived the putative father of a right to object to the adoption. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the natural mother did not have standing to assert the constitutional rights of the putative father because constitutional rights were personal and could not be asserted vicariously. The mother failed to show how she was prejudiced by not receiving the investigative reports prepared by a DISRS before the hearing on adoption and her argument was insufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of the correctness of the judgment of the trial court that she was not prejudiced. The trial court did not err in its determination that the mother consented to the adoption voluntarily without coercion, undue influence, or fraud, and that the best interest of the child would not be furthered by withdrawing the consent to adopt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The private club sought injunctive relief to prevent the city from enforcing the license fee. The trial court entered an order holding that the regulation of private clubs was within the city's police power, but also held that the fee was unconstitutional because it was not based on the cost of the regulation. The city challenged the ruling, contending that the trial court erred in finding that the private club overcame the presumption of validity attaching to the municipal ordinance. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the ordinance should have been upheld unless the amount required for the license was clearly arbitrary and unreasonable. The record showed that the license fee generated income of over $ 300,000, but the cost of administering the program was much less, so long as police expenses were excluded. The city contended that the trial court should have allowed evidence of police patrol costs into evidence as competent evidence of costs and administering and enforcing the licensing and regulation scheme. But the court disagreed, ruling that the evidence lacked probative value because it included expenses devoted to locations other than that of private clubs.</SPAN></P>

The lower court affirmed the trial court's grant of relief. On further appeal, the owners argued that the ordinance was unenforceable against their property because the city failed to comply with the notice requirements of Okla.

In reversing, the court ruled that the city's adoption of a comprehensive zoning plan was a matter of general public interest and required only general notice by publication pursuant to &sect; 404 but that when the specific restrictions and zoning changes were adopted affecting the owner's prior conforming use, specific notice to the owners was required under Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 405 (1971). The court held that a valid ordinance was a precondition to entitlement to injunctive relief and that the owners could raise the ordinance's invalidity without first seeking administrative relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners supported their demurrer by arguing that, under Norman, Okla., Ordinance #1890, an action on a surety bond had to be initiated prior to the expiration of the bond. The City claimed that the five year limitation of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; (1971) applied and began to run from the date of a breach of a condition of the bond. The court noted that under the City's ordinance, sidewalks had to be completed by the time that 65 percent of the lots of the subdivision were developed or within two years of the approval of the bond, whichever was first. If 65 percent of the lots were not developed, owners had two years for performance before the surety was liable on the bond. Thus, a breach of a condition of the bond might not accrue until the two years expired. The court concluded that it would violate Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 46 to construe the ordinance as a statute of limitations. The court held that the ordinance provision stating that the City had to institute an action prior to the expiration of the bond to recover the cost of uncompleted sidewalks was not a statute of limitations, but merely a directory provision. Therefore, non-compliance did not bar the City's action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On June 17, 1974, a foreclosure judgment was entered against the mortgagor for $ 933,376 and $ 93,338 in attorney's fees. The property was sold at public sale to the mortgagee for $ 620,100 that was two-thirds of the property's market value. The sale was confirmed on August 11, 1975 and the action for deficiency judgment was filed on October 16, 1975. The mortgagor alleged that Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 686(1971) required the mortgagee to file its motion for deficiency judgment simultaneously with the motion to confirm the sale. The court held that the mortgagee had 90 days after the sale to file the motion for the deficiency judgment. The mortgagor alleged that the deficiency judgment violated his due process rights. The court held that the mortgagor was provided with sufficient protection within the proceedings of the deficiency judgment. The deficiency judgment was the difference between the greater of the market value or sale price of the property and the amount of the judgment. Because the mortgagor did not appeal the foreclosure judgment, the court held that the mortgagor was estopped from protesting the amount of the attorney fees.

The county officers involved in the litigation were in the class that received lower salaries. The county officers had been assigned duties that were not germane to their respective offices.

The trial court also found that because the county officers were performing the same duties as officers who received salary increases, the county officers were denied equal protection of the laws. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment. The court found that the constitutional prohibition against salary increases under Okla.

The trial court held a hearing and found the evidence sufficient to adjudicate the children dependent. The children were placed in the temporary custody of the children's home. The mother appealed and argued that Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1101(d) (Supp. 1972) was void for vagueness. The court held that the &quot;proper parental care and guardianship&quot; provision of &sect; 1101 was sufficient for a dependency proceeding. The court held that the mere fact that the mother was no longer hospitalized did not make the trial court's denial of her demurrer to the evidence error. The court noted that the mother did not show that her mental health had improved.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the writ and the company appealed. It argued that the application of &sect;10 was unconstitutional and violated state and federal due process guarantees, and the taking of private property for private use. The state supreme court dissolved the writ of mandamus. Compelling a public utility to service a market not theretofore professed or undertaken as public business was an appropriation of private property without just compensation. Section 10 did just that. The company had not undertaken, professed to undertake, or desired to make natural gas available for residential purposes and for a hog operation to require the company to furnish and make available the gas sought by the landowners was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Materialman seeks payment for materials furnished subcontractor on construction projects through enforcement of lien, and other, rights, against certain entities, including the general contractor.  By counterclaim, and by making sub-contractor a third party defendant, general contractor seeks to impress particular funds paid by sub-contractor to materialman with a trust to pay for unpaid materials furnished.  General contractor asks for indemnity from any materialman's recovery against it and to recover additional expenses in completing the sub-contract; all as against the sub-contractor.  That sub-contractor cross-petitions against the general contractor for monies owed for unpaid, but performed construction work.  On trial to the court, judgment was entered allowing recovery to materialman as sought in the petition, including attorney fees, denying any relief against the materialman, and allowing judgments, with offsetting credit, sought by the general contractor and the subcontractor as against each other.  Judgment allowed general contractor&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and bondsman to be indemnified by sub-contractor for judgment rendered against them in favor of materialman.

The trial court allowed the supplier to recover payment for the materials that were furnished to the subcontractor. The court found the existence of an implied contract which required that the supplier provide electrical material for the subcontractor's use in complying with sub-contract on particular jobs and, therefore, a materialman lien was permissible under Okla. Stat. tit. 42, &sect; 143 (1971). The court also held that the general contractor was owed the construction trust funds that were paid to the subcontractor. The funds were needed to pay valid lienable claims against the construction projects that generated the funds. The supplier was charged with notice and, therefore, was required to inquire as to the source of the payments from the subcontractor and make payments according to the statutory trust imposed by Okla. Stat. tit. 42, &sect;&sect; 152, 153, rather than make a blanket application to the oldest purchase, on the basis of a letter agreement.</SPAN></P>

The department contended delinquent children, such as the youth, upon commitment to its custody, are its children, and are thereafter beyond the reach of the courts. The court granted certiorari and reinstated the order of dismissal because the court of criminal appeals had no authority to issue the relief sought by the department and the judge possessed the authority to voluntarily terminate his jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The Board entered its declaratory ruling that the brewer was required to sell to all licensed Class B wholesalers without contractual requirements made with its distributors, except as to quality controls of refrigeration and inventory rotation as specified in the ruling. The trial court affirmed the Board's ruling. On review, the court affirmed and held that &sect; 533, and the Board's declaratory ruling was an exercise of the State of Oklahoma's broad power to regulate the liquor industry and the court there was no need for concern that a private contract would be impaired or even destroyed.

The candidate contested the opponent's candidacy before the Board, which dismissed the candidate's contest without hearing evidence. The court denied the candidate's petition for writ of mandamus. The court held that where there was neither an explicit statutory nor constitutional provision setting forth explicitly the length of residence required to run for district judge, and the requirement contained in Okla. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, requiring six months durational residency to be a qualified elector was unconstitutional, there was effectively no residency requirement as a qualification for district judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In urging relief, the passenger argued that the trial erred in holding that Okla.

In denying relief, the court held that in prohibiting consolidation without the consent of all parties &sect; 559&nbsp;unconstitutionally encroached on the power of the judiciary to hear and decide justiciable controversies provided by Okla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 7 and thus was an abridgement of the separation of powers set forth in Okla. Const. art. IV &sect; 1. The court ruled that Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 79 (1971) merely permitted the court to grant consolidation in the exercise of sound judicial discretion and that there was nothing inherently improper in a statute defining procedure so long as it did not seek to supplant the exercise of judicial discretion. The court found that the two suits were for injuries sustained by the passenger and his wife in the same accident, both claimed damages against the same bus company, and both actions involved the same medical expert and common questions of fact as to liability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged an order of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which terminated her parental rights to six children, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1130 (Supp. 1975). The children were previously adjudged dependent and neglected under Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1101 et seq. (1972) and placed in the custody of appellee Oklahoma Department of Institutions, Social and Rehabilitative Services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a prior decision had disposed of the mother's claim that she was entitled to a jury trial. With respect to the mother's claim that there were no ascertainable standards for the application of Oklahoma's termination statutes, the court held that the standards were those determined in the prior adjudication of dependency and neglect. The court pointed out that termination could only be determined after the mother, over a period of six months, failed to correct the conditions condemned in the dependency hearings. Therefore, Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1130 (Supp. 1975) was not unconstitutionally vague because the mother had fair warning of the sanction and a guide by which to act. The court also rejected the mother's contention that &sect; 1130&nbsp;unconstitutionally placed the burden of proof upon her as to the issue of termination. The court opined that &sect; 1130 gave the mother only the burden of persuasion as to whether she corrected the conditions imposed upon her in the adjudicatory stage. However, because the record did not contain the pleadings and standards that evolved from the prior adjudication, the trial court's order was against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's holdings that the mother was not entitled to a jury trial, that Oklahoma's termination statutes were constitutional, and that the statutes did not wrongfully place the burden of proof on the mother. The court reversed the judgment terminating the mother's rights because the trial court's order was not supported by the evidence. The matter was remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The mother claimed that a verified petition for termination had been required, that Okla.

Thereafter, the trial court denied the mother's request and confirmed the referee's decision. When the appeals court reversed, the DISRS sought certiorari. Upon review, the mother claimed that a verified petition for termination had been required, that the trial court had erred in failing to grant a trial de novo, and that testimony as to the adoptability of the children had been inadmissible. The court held that no verification of pleadings was required where pleadings were filed in a juvenile action after children were adjudicated within the purview of the juvenile statutes and where the need for termination was fixed after the juvenile petition and summons were filed and issued. The court also held that &sect; 1126 did not require a trial de novo and that exclusion of the adoptability testimony would not have changed the decision to terminate.</SPAN></P>

The motion alleged that the child was seen at a hospital for a cut on the head, scratches on the body, and that the mother was unemployed and had no suitable residence for the child. The motion also urged that the mother failed to continue psychological counseling. A referee recommended termination of parental rights under Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1130, and the district court confirmed the findings. The mother appealed. On review, the court held that the referee's decision was not supported by the weight of the evidence, which tended to show that the mother was not confined to an institution, was able to care for the child, and that the child was well dressed and healthy in the mother's custody. The court remanded for dismissal of the motion to terminate.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1103 (1971).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was seen at a hospital for a cut on his head and a scratch on his body. The child was adjudicated as a dependent and neglected child by reason of his mother's incapacity due to illness. The State then sought termination of the mother's parental rights, which was granted. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. First, the court found that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction because the action to terminate rights was filed on an unverified petition. Second, the court determined that the fact that the mother was unemployed and the additional allegation that the mother had failed to continue counseling for her emotional problems, which had originally caused him to be dependent, were not elevated into the scope and intent of &sect; 1130. The court held that the juvenile court's construction of the statute was unconstitutional. Third, where a petition for neglect was filed, which did not seek termination and the child was adjudicated neglected, the mother did not thereafter have the burden of proof in a subsequent termination action. Fourth, the court held that the standard of proof required to support an order of termination was that of clear and convincing proof.</SPAN></P>

Honorable Elvin J. Brown, District Judge.  R.B. Carl, M.D., and State of Oklahoma, on relation of Larry Derryberry, Attorney General (appellants) challenge on appeal certain rulings of the District Court dismissing their action for injunctive relief which had the effect of compelling the Admissions Board of the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine to comply with Oklahoma's then existing &quot;open meeting law&quot;. 25 O.S. 1971, &sect; 201; which was repealed by Ch. 214, 1977 Session Laws.  The Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma (appellee) contended and the trial court ruled as a matter of law the Admissions Board was not a &quot;governing body&quot; of a state agency, was not supported in whole or in part by public funds, and was engaged in activities in the nature of personnel matters thus rendering Oklahoma's then existing &quot;Open Meetings Law&quot; inapplicable to activities of the Admissions Board.  </SPAN></P>

The court determined that the Board of Regents, the parent entity that created the Admission Board, came within the purview of &sect; 201, and the Admission Board was a subordinate entity that also came within the purview of &sect; 201 because it exercised decision making authority for the Board of Regents.

In reversing the decision the court erased any distinction made on the basis of whether the place where the work was performed was a garage or a service station, or one where minor repairs were made versus major overhauls. The court also dispatched an attempted distinction based on the whether power tools were used only incidentally in the performance of the work. The court noted that &sect; 3(11) declared a workshop to be any place where machinery was employed and manual or mechanical labor exercised for gain in repairing or adopting for sale any article or thing.

The court held that the building of the warehouse on the milk producer's premises in the city would not result in any increase of traffic on the &quot;major street&quot; necessitating improving the street.

Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1402a (Supp. 1977) He asserted the tax discriminated against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., art. I, &sect; 8, cl.3.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The businessman and intervenors argued that additional use tax placed a more onerous burden on products he brought into the state through interstate commerce than it imposed on products purchased within Oklahoma. Several foreign companies doing business in Oklahoma filed amici curiae briefs in support of the businessman's petition. The Oklahoma Municipal League filed an amicus curiae opposing the petition, based on the amount of tax dollars that would be lost if the tax were held unconstitutional. The court assumed original jurisdiction because the constitutionality of the statute was a matter of great public concern. The court rejected the Commission's argument that the use tax statutes could be applied to an in-state sale because by definition a use tax applied to out of state sales. Applying the equality test, as set out by the United States Supreme Court, the court held that &sect; 1402a was unconstitutional because it was it imposed an additional tax that resulted in an unequal and discriminatory tax burden on interstate commerce. The inequality was not rectified by the existence of statutorily enacted optional and non-uniform municipal sales taxes.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the tax was on the local state act of severance or production of gas without regard to sale in intrastate or interstate commerce that occurred after severance and after the levying of the tax. The court found that the levy was prior to entrance of any gas into interstate commerce and was on all gas so severed and produced without regard to subsequent entrance into either intra or interstate commerce. The court found that if there was an effect on produced gas entering on interstate commerce, that effect was incidental. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional as placing an undue and discriminatory burden on interstate commerce. The court further held that there was no discrimination between indirect owners of working interest and royalty interest as opposed to non-resident owners of working interest and royalty interest in Oklahoma.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother brought an action for divorce, requesting custody of the parties' two-year old child. She had taken care of the child since his birth. She was not employed and the overwhelming majority of her time was spent at home with him. The trial court granted the divorce to both parties, and awarded custody of the child to the father. On appeal, the court held that the trial court abused its discretion by ordering the child's custody placed with his father rather than with his mother. The gender-based means chosen by the Oklahoma Legislature for determining custody in a divorce action was substantially related to the important objective of providing for the welfare of its minor citizens and the classification scheme contained in Okla. Stat. tit. 30, &sect; 11 (1971) was constitutional. The evidence did not support the trial court's finding that the child's welfare and best interests would have been best served by placing his custody with his father. The mother was a fit and proper person to have the child's custody and the award of custody to the father was clearly against the weight of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer brought suit for specific performance of an sales contract for some 240 acres of real property that he entered into with the sellers' agent. The buyer, who lived in Alaska and was the sellers' brother, owned an undivided one-ninth interest in the real property. The sellers, who owned the other eight-ninths, sought partition. The trial court sustained the sellers' motions for summary judgment on the specific performance claim and ordered the suit to proceed as a partition action. The buyer appealed, contending that the statute of frauds was discriminatory and unconstitutional. The court disagreed, holding that: (1) the statute of frauds required the agency agreement to sell real property to be in writing and to be subscribed by the party to be charged; (2) the statute did not violate the prohibition against discrimination between citizens of different states; (3) the agent did not deny his authority as the sellers' agent; (4) the agent admitted by his affidavit that his authority was not in writing; and (5) the motions for summary judgment were properly granted where there was no material fact issue in dispute and the sellers were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was living in his mother's care. The child's father sometimes resided in the mother's home. The child was admitted to a hospital with severe medical problems, including pneumonia, severe dehydration, vomiting, hypernatremia, and severe anemia. As a result of subsequent investigation, the Oklahoma Department of Institutions, Social and Rehabilitative Services filed a petition in the district court alleging that the child's medical problems were the result of improper care by the child's mother. The child was made a ward of the court pursuant to a temporary order, with custody in the Department, and later adjudicated a dependent and neglected child, with custody in the Department. Although custody was temporarily returned to the mother, the child again had to be hospitalized and subsequently the motion to terminate parental rights was filed. The court held that the termination statute was not unconstitutionally vague, the trial court did not err in overruling the demurrer to the State's evidence, and the denial of trial by jury in the termination proceedings did not violate the mother's constitutional and statutory rights. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The district judge issued an order and dismissed the case. The district judge held that, under Okla. Const. art.

The State then filed a petition for writ with the court asking it to assume original jurisdiction against the district judge and bar the filing of the order dismissing the accusation for removal. The question on review was whether Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1182 (1910) was repealed and amended in such a manner that a duly empanelled grand jury could legally initiate a proceeding of accusation for removal against a county official. The court noted that removal proceedings were civil in nature, but that ouster proceedings had attributes in the nature of both a criminal action and civil action; thus, Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 18 was held not to repeal the power of a grand jury to initiate, investigate, or indict the removal of a public officer. The writ of prohibition was granted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother argued that the order lacked legal basis because it: (1) issued despite her requests for a trial by jury; and (2) had insufficient evidentiary support. The mother secured partial relief. The court began by noting that the right to jury secured by Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 19 was limited to those cases in which the right existed either at common law or in federal court just prior to statehood.The court's review of the language, structure, and history of the Oklahoma juvenile code led the court to conclude that the right to jury only extended to hearings to determine whether the child was within the purview of the code. Conversely, a hearing on the question of termination of parental rights was not a hearing to determine whether the child was within the purview of the juvenile code. Consequently, the legislature did not provide for a jury as part of termination proceedings. The record was deficient, however, in that its condition did not permit the court to determine whether the trial court had properly concluded that termination of the mother's parental rights was in the child's best interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment as it related to the finding that the mother was not entitled to a jury in the hearing determining whether her parental rights should be terminated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The question was whether Okla. Stat. tit. 41, &sect; 42 (Supp. 1973), was unconstitutional when tested by U.S. Const. amend. XIV as applied through 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and whether a private person acting under the statute did so under color of state law. The tenants rented a mobile home from the landlord, and while they were in the process of getting a divorce, they separated and left the mobile home and their personal property behind. It was winter, the furnace was not working, the pipes froze and burst, and water damaged the premises. The landlord stored the tenants' property and would not return it until they paid what they owed, so the tenants filed for replevin. The court opined that the state's legalization of certain action did not mean that the state was a participant, but that the state was establishing rules governing the parties' rights. The court noted that the disputed statute created only the right to act, but it did not require an action. The court stated that the landlord took the initiative, not the state, so it was not state action under the Fourteenth Amendment and was limited to the goods the landlord stored. The court concluded that the statute was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court did not agree with the trial court's interpretation of the phrase &quot;payment in any one case.&quot; The court stated that while there could be one information or case number, there were three separate cases contained in each information. Each defendant represented one case, and separate trials could be ordered for each defendant. The court held that the references in &sect; 701.14 pertained to each defendant. Further, the court held that mandamus did lie to require the trial court to pay up to $ 2,500 to each of the attorneys because the trial court erroneously interpreted the statute. The construction placed upon the statute by the trial court defeated the legislative intent to provide competent and effective assistance of counsel for indigents accused of capital offenses.</SPAN></P>

On appeal to the district court from an order of the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (Board) suspending the alcoholic beverage license of Heublein Wines International (Heublein), for thirty (30) days, the district court: (1) vacated Board's order of suspension because there was insufficient evidence to sustain a finding that Heublein was guilty of any willful misconduct that would justify a suspension or revocation of its license, and (2) determined that Art. 27, &sect; 5, of the Oklahoma Constitution and 37&nbsp;O.S. 1971, &sect; 516, which prohibit advertising the sale of alcoholic beverages, did not contravene the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

The wine company appealed to the district court and also sought a declaratory judgment declaring that the prohibitory provisions were unconstitutional. The district court vacated the Board's suspension on the ground that the wine company was not guilty of any willful misconduct. The district court also found that the prohibitory provisions did not violate the United States Constitution. The court affirmed, holding that the record did not support a finding that the wine company willfully allowed the unauthorized advertising because the evidence established that the telecasts were purely the product of mistake or inadvertence on the part of the national networks. The court further concluded that given the minimal interference with interstate commerce, the state's interest in prohibiting the advertising was superior to the wine company's interest in the unencumbered distribution of its commercials.</SPAN></P>

The motorist contended that defendant's absence from the state for over one year prior to the expiration of the period operated to toll the statute pursuant to Okla.

The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment on the ground that a portion of &sect; 98 which provided for the tolling of the limitations period for the time one absented himself from the state was unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection rights. The court ruled that the fact that defendant was an absent party had no relation to the purpose of &sect; 98, and to have ruled otherwise would have allowed the motorist to subject defendant to litigation over the incident at any time in the distant future.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Public officials seized the owner's property in Osage County pursuant to a levy of execution.

Although the trial court granted the motion to quash for lack of venue, the appellate court reversed and vacated that order. Certiorari was sought. The court vacated the appellate court's order, and affirmed that of the trial court, concluding that venue was not properly brought under Okla. Stat. tit. 12 &sect; 154 (1971). That was so because the action, which was against multiple defendants, had to satisfy all applicable venue statutes. Venue was proper against the foreign insurer where the cause of action arose, or where the agent was located, which was Oklahoma County. The public officials, however, were subject to suit only in Osage County, where the cause of action arose. The public officials were not required to submit to the jurisdiction of the Oklahoma County court.

The executor of the wife's estate sued to recover estate tax paid under protest. The trial court held that the additional property was includable in the taxable estate because the wife, at time of death, possessed a general power of appointment that was exercisable. The executor appealed. The issue was the constitutionality of Okla.

The court affirmed, holding that the tax was not in effect at the time the power was created through the death of the husband, but that because the wife had alternatives to dispose of the impacted property after the statute took effect, the assessment of additional tax under &sect; 807(A) was not arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

Appellees did not have a security interest in the personal property, and once a proper demand was made, the items should have been returned to the debtor.

Seven years after the building was completed, there were heavy rains that cause water to accumulate on the roof. The water caused serious property damage. The corporation filed an action against the architect for negligent design, engineering, and installation. The architect demurred to the action on the ground that it was barred by the five year limitations of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 109 (1971). The district court sustained the architect's demurrer. The corporation claimed on appeal that Section 109 violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court ruled that the statute violated the Fourteenth amendment because it excluded one limited class of defendants, the owners or tenants in possession, from its protection and created a situation where an owner could be responsible after five years for injuries to a third person, while the architect, who was primarily responsible for the injuries would be immune from suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee argued that the ordinance related to nude dancing in private clubs was an unconstitutional restriction of First Amendment rights, and Okla.

Upon review, the court found that the ordinance was a constitutional exercise of the city's police power to promote public peace, health, and welfare. The ordinance was not based upon the censoring of a dramatic performance, but was based upon the regulation of the consumption of alcohol. Further, the court found that there was no usurpation of state authority or any conflict with any statutory provisions that prohibited the licensing of private premises where liquor was consumed. The licensee was not denied a fair hearing because the police chief initiated the investigation and filed the complaint and the police and fire commissioner participated in the hearing as a member of the board. The two offices were separate entities with different responsibilities and authority.</SPAN></P>

The debtor defaulted. Appellees demanded payment, were refused, and then repossessed the truck by self-help. The appellate court held that appellees' act of repossessing collateral from the debtor violated Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7 because it constituted a deprivation of the debtor's property without first affording him due process of law. In doing so, the appellate court overruled the lower court's holding that upheld appellees' act of repossessing its collateral. The court found that there was no state action in the self-help repossession made pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12A, &sect; 9-503 (1971). Section 9-503 did not violate due process of law because the buying public was well aware of the fact that the contractual right of self-help repossession was an essential part of every automobile sales contract and, thus, they were not entitled to a hearing and notice before recaption. The contractual agreement authorizing self-help did not constitute a waiver of the debtor's constitutional benefits that rendered the contract null and void.</SPAN></P>

The market denied error on the part of the trial court and presented the issue of the constitutionality of the Oklahoma statutes classifying minors by gender.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, an oil company engaged in business throughout the country, was disallowed a carryover deduction claimed on its tax return for net operating losses and paid, under protest, an additional assessment of Oklahoma income taxes for the taxable year. After a hearing, the Commission denied the protest. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2353(12) (1971), Oklahoma taxable income meant taxable income pursuant to federal law, adjusted further as provided in Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 2358 (1971), and that &sect; 2358 provided that if a carryover loss was allowed on a taxpayer's federal return, &sect; 2358(A)(3)(d) limited that figure to that portion attributable to activities carried on in Oklahoma.

Section 1, and the Oklahoma Fair Trade Act, or, in the alternative, whether a formal written contract was required in order to gain immunity from antitrust violation as provided in the Miller-Tydings Act and the Oklahoma Fair Trade Act?  This court answers the question as follows: In order to gain immunity from antitrust violation as provided in the Miller-Tydings Act, the Oklahoma Fair Trade Act, 78 O.S. 1971, &sect; 41 et seq., now repealed, did not require the contracts relating to sale or resale, as therein provided, to be formal written contracts.

After a full evidentiary, dispositional hearing, the mother's parental rights to the children were terminated in the absence of a change in the mother's condition.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners sought a variance authorizing the operation of a real estate office in a zoning district established exclusively for residential purposes. The zoning board ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to grant a principal use variance based on Tulsa, Okla., Rev. Ordinance tit. 42, ch.14, &sect; 1470.1 (1969). The property owners filed a petition for a declaratory judgment, and the district court granted their motion for summary judgment, declaring &sect; 1470.1 invalid. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the local ordinance was in conflict with Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect; 407 (1971). The court stated that to limit the zoning board's authority to only set-back building regulations under &sect; 410 would be an unduly restrictive interpretation of &sect; 407. The zoning board had the authority to permit principal use variances. If the state legislature had intended to restrict such authority, it would have amplified the matters enumerated in &sect; 401. The intent of the Oklahoma Zoning Act was to give property owners the opportunity to present their claims of hardship to the zoning board. The local ordinance exceeded the city's powers delegated by statute and was invalid.</SPAN></P>

Byron McFall and others similarly situated (appellants) brought suit challenging the constitutionality of an ordinance of the City of Shawnee (appellee) assessing nonresident lessees of lakeside lots $100.00 annual fee and resident lessees $25.00 annual fee.  The District Court, Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, Honorable Donald E. Powers, District Judge, upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance and rendered judgment for the City.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city leased lakeside lots and instituted an ordinance that assessed a fee to the lessees. The ordinance required the nonresident lessees to pay a higher fee than their resident lessee counterparts. The nonresident lessees filed an action against the city, challenging the constitutionality of assessing different fees based on their residency. The trial court determined that the ordinance was constitutional and the nonresident lessees sought review. The appellate court reversed the trial court's decision and the city sought certiorari. The court granted certiorari and held that, in order to uphold a municipal ordinance that subjected the nonresident lessees to higher fees based solely on their residency, there had to be a rational relationship between the treatment and the city's reason for the additional fees. The court found that the city's ordinance was presumed to be constitutional and that the nonresident lessees had the burden of proving the lack of a rational relationship. Since the nonresident lessees failed to provide evidence that there was no rational relationship between the additional fees and their residency, the ordinance was determined to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed. Although the court believed it would have been a commendable practice, it did not find that Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 611 (1971) was sufficiently encompassing to require the trial court to make findings of fact and to state conclusions of law when it sustained a demurrer or a motion to dismiss, or that failure to do so was reversible error. However, the court reversed the trial court's order because it held that the trial court erred in sustaining a demurrer based on the allegation that the Oklahoma Housing Authorities Act was unconstitutional as it related to the granting of the power of eminent domain to Indian Housing Authorities. The court held that the acquiring of property under the provisions of the Oklahoma Housing Authorities Act was a constitutional taking of property for the public use and welfare. The court also found the statutes in question to be a constitutional exercise of the complete power of the legislature to delegate the right of eminent domain to Indian Housing Authorities.</SPAN></P>

To hold that a bond and a stay were mandatory would allow the legislature to impermissibly invade the court's role in granting injunctions.

The osteopath claimed that the order deprived him of an existing license without a hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1961, the osteopath, who was licensed in Oklahoma, was investigated, surrendered his federal narcotic stamp, was charged with unprofessional conduct, and was the subject of a disciplinary complaint before the Board. In lieu of a hearing, he surrendered his license. He moved to Missouri, where he practiced under a Missouri license until it was revoked by that state's board. From 1962 through 1964, the Board issued renewal receipts to the osteopath. In 1972, the osteopath applied for renewal or reinstatement and, after a hearing, the Board entered an order requiring him to show proof of a license from another state or apply for reexamination. The court affirmed. The osteopath's 1961 surrender of his license was not temporary and ended his status as a licensee in the state. The renewal receipts resulted from administrative error and were of no effect because no license existed and, therefore, could not be renewed. Okla. Stat. tit. 75, &sect; 314 (1971) did not apply to the surrender of a license, the hearing requirement had been satisfied, and the Board's order acted within its authority under Okla.

Further, the school board's rules and regulations that refused to affiliate with any association that was disruptive or unsupportive of the school board were unconstitutional as an abridgment of freedom of speech and a denial of equal protection. The school board only had absolute discretion to determine whether or not to open school buildings to the public and, once that discretion had been exercised and a decision was been made to permit use of property, the school board could not adopt a discriminatory and unconstitutional policy as to who would be allowed access to the facilities.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer asserted hat the classification of natural persons made in the law was unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and under Okla. Const. art. X, &sect; 5. The court noted that the disparity in the tax rates between a single individual and a married individual arose solely from a provision in the Oklahoma law that permitted a married individual to file a joint return. The court held that the Oklahoma Legislature had a rational basis for the distinction drawn between married and single persons for purposes of the applicable rates of taxation. The action of the legislature in creating the classifications was founded on the &quot;ability to pay.&quot; Because the separate classification of single and married taxpayers was a reasonable classification, the classification did not violate either the Oklahoma or Federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

The gas field was abandoned around 1957, and the wells had not been operated thereafter. Two years after the wells were shut in, the operator's predecessor assigned the lease back to the landowner's predecessors. Years later, the Commission's field inspector found that the wells had not been properly plugged. The operator argued that the Commission had no authority to require it to plug the wells under Okla. Stat. tit. 17, &sect; 53 (1971) because the wells were not abandoned and were assigned to the predecessors. The court disagreed. The wells were abandoned long before the assignment. An employee of the operator's predecessor testified that the wells were abandoned. The terms of the assignment did not relieve the operator of its obligations. Intent to abandon could be established by acts rather than from possibilities of future use of the wells. Section 53 was constitutional. An operator was responsible for plugging the well under &sect; 53, not a stranger to the operation. The time to plug a well was when it was abandoned. The Commission's order was proper.</SPAN></P>

When appellants were unable to raise the money necessary for publication notice, the trial court denied their petition to have the costs taxed to the court. The trial court found that the attempt of appellants' attorney at alternative service by posting copies of the notice conspicuously was unauthorized by statute and that it thus lacked jurisdiction over the mother. On appeal, the court held that: (1) publication was the sole method for providing notice to an unavailable parent under &sect; 1131; (2) the statute required the payment of a fee that rendered it impossible for indigent parties to have access to the sole method for terminating parental rights prior to adoption; (3) the state could not prescribe a method for dissolving parental rights prior to adoption and then procedurally deny appellants access to that method; and (4) &sect; 1131 was unconstitutional as applied because it deprived indigents of their due process rights.</SPAN></P>

On review, the surety contended that he should have received written notice at least ten days before the required appearance of his principal under Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 1330 (1971), and since no written notice was given, the forfeiture order was void. The court rejected the argument, holding that the ten-day notice provision did not apply to a bond forfeiture. The court reasoned that under Okla.

On review, the court held that the company was not estopped to deny that the claimant was engaged in a hazardous employment at the time of his injury. Because the Workmen's Compensation Law provided a substitute remedy for employees covered thereby and did not take away the common law remedy from employees not covered, and since the provisions of the Estoppel Act, Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner filed a tort action against the pipeline company, alleging that it constructed a pipeline across a portion of the landowner's property without prior consent and that the pipeline company constructed its pipeline upon the land without resorting to condemnation proceedings. The landowner further alleged that he had never been compensated and sought to recover punitive and other non-land damages for the wrongful invasion of his property rights and for injury resulting from the emotional strain caused by the company's wrongful and wanton conduct. The trial court found that the landowner's sole and exclusive remedy for the taking of his lands was a reverse condemnation action. On appeal, the court found that under Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 24, any person who went into possession under the power of eminent domain without condemnation proceedings had no title. The court also found that the public utility, which was invested with the power to exercise the right of eminent domain, was not thereby clothed with an immunity to trespass actions. The court concluded that the landowner had a distinct cause of action in trespass for damages and for punitive damages.</SPAN></P>

The Commission en banc sustained the referee's recommendations denying relief and dismissing the complaint but ordered hydrostatic tests by a specified date and repetition of the test at five year intervals. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the enactment of enabling legislation pursuant to the federal Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1671-84, the Commission issued Order No. 70510, establishing safety standards. The Commission made findings on six specific complaints the landowners presented. The court held that the finding that the welding substantially complied with the safety regulations was an insufficient adjudication of the issue presented. The court explained that the promulgated standards were the minimum required. The court added that the Commission in effect found that the pipeline company &quot;substantially complied&quot; with the &quot;minimum standards&quot; prescribed for welding, but the issue presented was whether the welding complied with the minimum standards of acceptability. The court explained that if the evidence established a particular weld or welds failed to meet the minimum standards, the landowners were entitled to some relief involving that particular defective weld or welds. The court rejected the landowners' argument that it was a denial of equal protection to enforce stricter safety standards in urban areas than in rural areas.</SPAN></P>

The Board held that &sect; 1001(h) was unconstitutional and denied relief. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 1001(h) was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power because it established standards and guidelines for the Board to use in raising or lowering the seven percent gross production tax rate. Because the Board failed to adjudicate whether the seven percent gross production rate was greater or less than the general ad valorem taxes for all purposes would be, the court reversed and remanded for further proceedings. It held that it was the sole responsibility of the Board to determine the assessed valuation of the property, to set the assessment ratio for that class of property, and to apply it uniformly throughout the state. It further held that any property, including hydrocarbon reserves, that had to be assessed in compliance with &sect; 1001(h) could be constitutionally assessed at no more than 35 percent of its fair market value, estimated at a price that the property would bring at a voluntary sale.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court improperly entered judgment in favor of the owner because the legislative creation of presumed malice under the Oklahoma libel and slander statutes was unconstitutional. If the injured individual in a defamation action was a private individual, then the states were allowed to define for themselves the appropriate standard of liability of the news media, but the choice was not unlimited.

The court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1171.1 (1971) controlled, which prohibited prejudgment garnishment of personal wages. The court rejected the wife's contention the order was proper under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 1276, which was a general statute governing the disposition of property in a divorce action. The court held that a statute that was enacted for the primary purpose of dealing with a particular subject prevailed over a general statute that did not refer to the particular subject matter but contained language that might be broad enough to cover the subject matter if the special statute was not in existence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was a private corporation engaged in the business of exploring for and producing oil and gas and associated hydrocarbons. The company owned and maintained a gathering line across lands owned by the individual for the purpose of transporting gas produced by the company from its wells to a gas processing plant. The line across the individual's land was maintained pursuant to a private easement, which was acquired by the company through purchase and not through eminent domain. The company had never engaged in the gas distribution business. The court held that the Commission had limited jurisdiction under Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 10 (1971), which required that a corporation connect a property owner outside of a municipality to any gas line that crossed the owner's land. The statute conferred no jurisdiction upon the Commission to enforce the provisions thereof. The court previously held that the Commission was without authority to hear disputes between two or more private persons or entities in which the public interest was not involved. Accordingly, the Commission had no jurisdiction over the action and the constitutional question was not reached.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Estate taxes were filed for decedent's estate by the taxpayer, its administrator. The Commission assessed additional tax. Two years later, while the protest was pending, the taxpayer amended the protest seeking a refund. The Commission found that the taxpayer did not file a timely petition. A timely protest was filed but it did not refer to assessments on a bond that the taxpayer was challenging. The addition of the challenge to the tax on the bonds was not an amendment to the original protest and did not relate back to the original filing. The taxpayer argued that Okla. Stat. Art. 68, &sect; 227 (1971) provided a three year statute of limitations for actions to recover taxes erroneously paid and the court found that &sect; 227 did not apply to estate taxes, which required more rapid settlement. The time limit in Okla. Stat. Art. 68, &sect; 815 (1971) was not applicable to overpayments made by reason of federal tax liability not being finally determined at the time taxes were assessed. Even though the claim was not timely filed regarding the assessment on the bonds, an issue of taxability of those bonds was shown and &sect; 815 permitted the correction of an assessment as justice required.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment because Okla. Stat. tit. 69, &sect; 1302 authorized the department to close off the street. The property owners also argued that they had a right of ingress and egress to their premises by way of the closed street and could not be deprived of this right without due process of law and compensation for loss.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State had filed suit based on Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 942 (1971) and obtained an injunction against the optician to stop him from examining the human eye or duplicating contact lenses without a written prescription from an ophthalmologist, oculist, or optometrist. The trial court refused to enjoin the optician from duplicating regular lenses or using a Kerotometer, a machine that measured lens curvature. The court of appeals reversed in part, enjoining the optician from duplicating regular lenses as well but did not reach the question concerning the Kerotometer. On certiorari review, the court agreed that, under &sect; 942, without a written prescription, no optician could supply a lens, whether a new lens or a duplicate of a lost or broken lens. However, the court agreed with the trial court that &sect; 942 permitted an optician to use a Keratometer as an aid in fitting contact lenses. Section 942 was more broadly worded than statutes regulating opticians in other states. The use of a machine to measure lens curvature required technical rather than medical expertise, was necessary to the proper fitting of contact lenses, and was not traditionally performed by opthalmologists.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the court of appeals' reversal of the portion of the trial court's judgment that failed to enjoin the optician from duplicating regular lenses.

The employee's duties involved administrative work and manual labor. He was injured when stepping from a dock, lacerating his right hand and injuring his lower spine.

The lower court refused to apply the estoppel provision in Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 65.2. The employee appealed. The court reversed and remanded. First, the court held that an insurance carrier included own-risk employers within its definitive scope. Next, the court held that construing the Act in light of Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect;&sect; 3 (9), 65.2 (1971), it was apparent that own-risk employers fell into the same category as employers that insured privately. Effect could be given both statutes only by recognizing Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 3(9), as declarative of a legislative intent that own-risk employers bear the same responsibilities under the Act.

The court noted that the resolution did not impose any regulation as to how the company could conduct its business or interfere in the internal affairs of its business. The court determined that the company's position that it would incur some expense to manufacturer the appropriate pipe was not sufficient grounds to invalidate the resolution. The court noted that it would not interfere with an exercise of the city's police power unless the act was manifestly unreasonable and oppressive, unwarrantedly invaded private rights, clearly transcended the police powers given to them, or infringed upon the rights secured by fundamental law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city's pension system was financed in part through a two percent mandatory contribution from all policemen. No one was forced to become policemen, so the contributions were considered voluntary. They only became involuntary once the policemen had joined the force, when they could not withdraw consent without losing their jobs. Some of the former policemen who had resigned or been discharged sought to recover contributions they had made to their pension and retirement fund, but the city refused, pursuant to Ordinance No. 2.52.220. The policemen filed an action in mandamus to compel the payments on the grounds that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment in their favor, and defendants appealed. The court reversed and remanded for dismissal, holding that the ordinance was not unreasonable because it was possible that there was no perfect correlation between the two percent of gross salary contributions and the benefits the policemen received while employed by the city, but there was some correlation. The enforced contribution with a no refund policy, in light of the extra protection afforded the officers and their families, was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

In granting the writ, the court held that where the specifications of an architect required carpet installation as an essential part of a public building's construction, the bids for it were subject to the Act. The court also held that the trustees' acceptance of a previously rejected bid had not complied with the Act because: (1) rejection of all the bids had required a re-solicitation; and (2) the exception under Okla. Stat. tit. 61, &sect; 130 (Supp. 1974) was inapplicable. Moreover, the court held that a public agency could not extend the mandatory time requirements of Okla.

The court agreed with the parents that for the judge to remove their children from their home and custody for a period of two months without a meaningful hearing, in which they might have presented testimony and evidence to support their position that the allegations in the petition were untrue, was unconstitutional and a denial of due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, an employer and others, sought review of an order of the State Industrial Court (Oklahoma), which affirmed a trial judge's order, awarding claimants, a surviving wife and children, death benefits. The benefits were compensation for the death of an employee, the deceased, as the result of an accidental injury in covered employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased had a history of heart problems during his years of employment with the employer. The deceased suffered an attack during work and was awarded total permanent disability benefits. The deceased suffered other episodes of heart trouble and died about two or three years later from another heart episode. The lower court affirmed the trial judge's order finding that the deceased suffered an accidental injury at work, which resulted in his death. The court found that the lower court's determination of the issue of whether the deceased's death resulted from an accidental injury at work or resulted from other causes was supported by competent evidence. The court found that the date of the deceased's death controlled the amount of recovery. The right of the claimants to claim death benefits under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 22(7) (1971) did not accrue until the date of the deceased's death. Adjudication of those rights was properly made under the law applicable on that date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner candidate filed a &quot;petition in error&quot; against the judgment of the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma), which sustained a motion to quash and plea to the jurisdiction and venue filed by respondent Secretary of the State Election Board in the candidate's action for a writ of mandamus to have to his name placed on the ballot as an independent candidate for governor. The Secretary filed a motion to dismiss the &quot;petition in error.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The candidate alleged that he was indigent and unable to pay the filing fee for the office. In his &quot;petition in error,&quot; the candidate complained that the Secretary's decision denied him a place on the ballot. The court held that the trial court was correct in dismissing the candidate's case since it was improperly brought in Tulsa County. Any action against the State Election Board had to be filed in Oklahoma County. The court treated the candidate's pleadings as both a petition in error and an attempt for an original action for writ of mandamus. Although the appeal and action could have been dismissed on procedural grounds, the court decided that case against the candidate on its merits. Under Okla. Stat. tit. 26, &sect; 161 (1971), the candidate was required to either pay the filing fee or file a petition signed by five percent of the qualified electors. The candidate did neither, but argued that the statute was unconstitutional The court disagreed. The statute provided a reasonable alternative to a filing fee for the state to test the &quot;seriousness&quot; of a candidate. Thus, its method was reasonable, did not unduly discriminate against indigents, and was constitutionally firm.</SPAN></P>

The Commission did not respond to the taxpayer's request to advise him if an administrative hearing was a prerequisite for a direct appeal to the court. The court had no jurisdiction over the taxpayer's appeal because the Commission issued no order or ruling from which appeal was authorized. However, the court held that the taxpayer's amended returns and supporting schedules were procedurally sufficient as claims for refunds under Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect;&sect; 2352 and 2373 (1971), and entitled him to an order denying or approving the claim because the returns were signed under penalty of perjury and indicated the taxpayer's name, the periods for which the income taxes were paid, and the gist of his claim.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that if a legislative act was founded in reason and was general in terms, it would not be rendered invalid simply because at the time the statute was enacted only certain municipalities fell within its classification. The courts did not concern themselves as to whether an act of the legislature was wholesome and salutary in its operation or whether such legislation was unwise and harmful. Statutes were presumed to be valid absent a conclusive showing that the legislation was arbitrary or capricious and bore no reasonable relation to the object to be accomplished.</SPAN></P>

The driver amended his petition alleging that it had been unconstitutional for the Department to have maintained a file and report to the public existence of bond forfeitures. Insurance companies tended to have charged the driver a higher premium because of their knowledge of the numerous occasions on which he had forfeited bail on traffic complaints. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of any relief. The driver asserted that treating a bond forfeiture equal to a conviction was unconstitutional. The court ruled that the driver had failed in entering an appearance, waiving the right to appear, and that in order to have avoiding having a bond forfeiture entered on a driving record, a licensee must have merely appeared and answered the arresting officer's charges. The court concluded that the legislature, by enacting &sect; 6-204(c), intended to have attributed to a bond forfeiture the same legal consequences as those which attended a conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 594 provided that an optometrist could not have his practice adjacent to or in geographical proximity to a retail optical outlet or optical store. The optometrist had leased an office in a building where a retail optical outlet had leased space on the opposite side of the hall. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that a proper justiciable controversy existed for declaratory judgment because the optometrist was not required to hazard a breach of &sect; 594 before bringing an action for declaratory relief. The court noted that the optometrist could be subjected to criminal prosecution and lose his license for violation of the statute. Upon review of the language of &sect; 594, the court held that the statute was vague and ambiguous because it was unclear what constituted &quot;adjacent to&quot; a retail optical outlet and what constituted &quot;geographical proximity.&quot; Although the court noted that the terms in question might be definite enough in other situations, the court found that they were not sufficiently definite in the relevant statute as it imposed criminal penalties.</SPAN></P>
