Appellants moved to another county, but son again was denied permission to play sports given the Commission's ruling. In their new county of residence, appellants, on behalf of their son, filed unlawful discrimination and defamation suit against Commission and other appellees that had no connection to the county of filing. Appellees moved to dismiss on ground that circuit court lacked venue to try the action. With appellant father and sons' approval, court dismissed action. As to appellant mother, court dismissed on lack of venue ground. Appellants challenged trial court's dismissal.

The trial court denied appellant's motion for a mistrial. Appellant was convicted of first-degree sexual assault and sexual abuse by a custodian. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction, because the trial court abused its discretion in not granting a mistrial. There was sufficient unfair prejudice in the prosecutor's argument to the jury, to the effect that defense counsel had failed to deny that appellant had committed the offenses charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of two felony murder counts and of conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery. The prosecution used a copy of a juvenile petition from appellant's juvenile justice records in cross-examination of appellant's mother to demonstrate that despite her assertions that he was a &quot;good kid,&quot; she had filed a petition for delinquency against him. The petition itself was apparently not introduced into evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The trial court did not err by allowing appellant's juvenile justice records to be obtained and used by the prosecution against appellant, because the records were used for the purpose of impeachment during the cross-examination of a witness for appellant and were not used in the prosecution's &quot;case-in-chief.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of multiple counts stemming from his flight to avoid arrest. After being sentenced to an aggregate term of over seven years in the county jail, he appealed. The court held that it could not consider the trial court's denial of appellant's proffered jury instruction because he had not properly objected at trial. The sentences were within statutory limits and not impermissible factors influenced the lower court's sentencing. Since simultaneous sentences were to be served consecutively by statute and the cases did not involve unlimited sentences or a life recidivist statute, proportionality principles were not applied. The court could not evaluate the merits of his claim of deprivation in the county jail absent information for comparison. The legislature intended to create two flight offenses; one with a vehicle and one without. Defendant's various instances of flight were separate and distinct occurrences. The convictions and sentences were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent governor appointed a current legislator to the office of Supreme Court Justice, although during the appointee's term of office the legislature had approved an increase in salary for the justices. Petitioners filed suit seeking a writ of mandamus and/or prohibition requiring respondent governor to appoint an individual to that office who was not barred by the Emoluments Clause, W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 15. The court issued the writ, finding that the Emoluments Clause, with one exception, rendered a member of the legislature ineligible to be elected or appointed to a civil office for profit that had been created, or the emoluments of which had been increased, during the legislator's term of office. The sole exception operated to allow an otherwise ineligible legislator to gain public office through popular election. The provision in question would only apply to a legislator's current term of office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner jail authority sought a writ of prohibition alleging that respondent magistrate was wrongfully refusing to impose statutory court costs pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 50-3-2 (1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent magistrate informed the administrative director's office that he was troubled by certain court cost assessments and challenged the assessment of $ 55.00 in court costs in certain criminal cases as required by W. Va. Code &sect; 50-3-2 (1996). Respondent would only impose the fee in cases where a criminal defendant was convicted after a trial, and not where the conviction was the result of a plea. The office informed respondent as well as others that they were to impose the fee in all criminal cases, whether by plea or by trial. Petitioner jail authority sought a writ of prohibition alleging that respondent exceeded the jurisdiction of the magistrate court by refusing to assess the fee in all criminal proceedings pursuant to section 50-3-2 thereby depriving the regional jail and prison development fund of its dedicated source of revenue. The court found that respondent's refusal to assess the statutory fee where a conviction was a result of a plea was erroneous as a matter of law because section 50-3-2 clearly evinced a legislative intent that magistrates were to collect court costs upon conviction in all criminal cases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition for writ of prohibition as moulded because respondent's refusal to impose the court costs ignored the legislative intent of the statute. The court ordered respondent to make a good faith effort to collect the court costs, which it previously failed to assess for convictions resulting from a plea, and to assess the $ 55.00 in court costs in all criminal cases resulting in a conviction, whether by plea or trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner construction foundation requested a writ of prohibition or mandamus to prohibit respondent commissioner from dismissing civil actions instituted by the Workers' Compensation Division and having any further involvement in the actions. Further, petitioner sought to direct respondent commissioner and respondent council to promulgate rules and regulations governing the conduct of litigation commenced by respondent commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner construction foundation sought a writ prohibiting respondents, commissioner, bureau, and council, from dismissing civil actions instituted by the Workers' Compensation Division against certain corporate entities under theories of imputed liability for delinquent workers' compensation premiums, penalties, and interest. The court found that, in dismissing the actions at issue, respondent commissioner was performing a purely administrative function. Because the writ of prohibition never issues against administrative officials performing purely administrative acts, a remedy by prohibition was not available. Further, the court found that respondent commissioner had a fiduciary obligation to maintain the workers compensation fund. However, the possibility that the dismissal of the civil actions would impair the workers' compensation fund and render the fund unable to fulfill its purpose was purely speculative. Therefore, petitioner did not show that respondent commissioner violated his fiduciary duty to maintain the workers' compensation fund. Accordingly, the petition was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The writ of prohibition or mandamus was denied because the dismissal of lawsuits involved was within the discretion of the respondent commissioner. Further, respondent commissioner's dismissal of the civil actions was not arbitrary or capricious. There was no clear legal duty for respondents, commissioner, bureau, and council, to do the things, which petitioner construction foundation sought to compel.</SPAN></P>

Evid. 404 and 612, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 14. Defendant also sought to exclude his custodial statements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of sexual assault of his wife, in violation of W. Va. Code &sect; 61-8B-6(b) (1997). On appeal, the court rejected defendant's argument that he had the right to impeach the victim using DNA evidence that included sperm from at least two other men at the victim's medical exam after the alleged rape. The court held that the DNA evidence was properly excluded under West Virginia's rape shield statute,&nbsp;W. Va. Code &sect; 61-8B-11(b) (1997), because the victim did not testify about her prior sexual conduct. The court also held that W. Va. R. Evid. 404 and 612 did not require admission of the DNA evidence and that defendant's due process rights were not violated. The court also rejected defendant's claim that his Miranda rights were violated by admission of statements made while being transported by police. The court concluded that Miranda warnings were not required after arrest until police interrogation began and specifically overruled West Virginia cases that held otherwise. The court held that the issue of whether the prosecutor engaged in misconduct in charging him with second degree sexual assault under W. Va. Code &sect; 61-8B-4 (1997) was not properly preserved at trial.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to a plea agreement with the state, appellant pled guilty to attempted aggravated robbery in exchange for the state dismissing the murder charge pending against her.

She contended that the 50-year sentence was unconstitutionally excessive and disproportionate to the character and degree of the offense she committed. The court concluded that although appellant did not personally shoot the victim, she was responsible for setting the chain of events in motion that led to his death. The sentence imposed did not shock the conscience of the court and society, and the circuit court considered the violent and dangerous nature of the crime committed by appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant was being treated for back pains and discomfort caused by ingesting cocaine and drinking beer, the attending nurse observed a gun in defendant's jacket. Defendant left the hospital before police arrived. Before defendant returned to pick up a friend, a nearby store was robbed by a man wearing clothing reportedly identical to that worn by defendant. An eyewitness also observed the license plate number of the vehicle that defendant was driving that night. The jury found defendant guilty of aggravated robbery, and the trial court sentenced him to 30 years imprisonment. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict. The prosecution's late disclosure of photographs depicting the license plate number was not prejudicial because such evidence was redundant. Defendant's direct testimony invited cross- examination into his cocaine addiction. No prejudice or manifest injustice arose from the prosecution's opening and closing remarks. Under the subjective test for proportionality, defendant's sentence within the statutory limits did not shock the conscience of the court and society.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for aggravated robbery because circumstantial evidence that defendant's clothing matched that worn by the robber and an eyewitness' observation of the license plate number of the car reportedly driven by defendant was sufficient evidence of defendant's guilt.

The amendment also reduced the amount and duration of PTD awards. Petitioner employers wanted these amendments to apply to their employees' claims that were filed after the amendments became effective.

Petitioners filed for a writ of mandamus to compel respondent to apply the amendments to claims that had a date of injury or last exposure prior to amendments' effective date.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner prosecuting attorney filed for a writ of prohibition to prevent the dismissal of sexual assault charges against respondent accused. The trial court granted respondent's motion for judgment of acquittal after the evidence at trial proved the dates of the offenses were different than those in the indictment. The court granted the writ of prohibition, finding that the mere discrepancies in the dates was not sufficient to grant acquittal where time was not of the essence of the offense. The court determined that time was not an element of the sexual assault offenses and that petitioner was under no obligation to prove that the sexual assaults occurred on the specific dates listed in the indictment. The court did conclude that a variance between the indictment and the proof would be considered material if the variance misled respondent in presenting his defense to the charges and exposed him to the danger of being put in jeopardy again for the same offense. However, the court determined that respondent did not provide any specifics in how the discrepancies in the dates prejudiced his defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant debtor's credit card account became chronically delinquent, appellee creditor bank filed suit to collect from appellant $ 5,115.28 plus interest in unpaid credit card charges. Appellant answered the complaint with a general denial and served a 10 count amended counterclaim alleging various violations of the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act (WVCCPA), W.Va. Code &sect; 46A-1-101 et seq. The circuit court found that appellee was entitled to $ 5,115.28 plus prejudgment interest and statutory interest subsequent. Finding that appellee violated the WVCCPA by telephoning appellant's neighbor and falsely stating that there was a banking emergency, the circuit court imposed the statutory penalty of $ 1000.00 against appellee for its violation of the WVCCPA. After its motion for a new trial or, in the alternative, to alter or amend judgment was denied, appellant sought review of the judge's decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee faculty member filed a grievance with the West Virginia Education and Employees Grievance Board (board) regarding the fact that he was not permitted to pursue outside employment as an emergency room physician. An administrative law judge ruled in favor of appellee finding that he had the right to continue outside employment. The circuit court subsequently upheld an award of lost wages to appellee in excess of $ 1,000.000.00 and awarded appellee attorney fees. Appellant sought review of the decision after its motion to amend the judgment was denied. The court found that because West Virginia University would be responsible for any award of attorney fees to appellee and public funds would be involved, constitutional immunity applied. However, because appellee sought attorney fees accumulated in litigating a tort action, the court held that appellee's claim fell under the exception to constitutional immunity which allowed suits seeking recovery under and up to the limits of the state's liability insurance coverage. The court reversed the circuit court's award of attorney fees which were in excess of the state's $ 1,000.000.00 liability insurance coverage.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed suit seeking a writ of mandamus and injunctive relief to prohibit appellee from removing appellant before the expiration of his term and to declare the appointment of the successor null and void. Appellant sought review of the lower court's decision after it denied the requested relief. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and found that the members of the commission had no special status based on their quasi-judicial functions, either through statutory or common law, granting them protection from &sect; 6-6-4 which allowed the removal of appointed officials at a governor's will and pleasure. Furthermore the court found that &sect; 6-6-4 was constitutional and did not violate separation of powers. The court also held that &sect; 6-6-4 did not conflict with W.Va.

Code &sect; 9-6-15(b) (1984).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants intentionally left the wife's father, a substantially disabled and incapacitated person, alone in their home during a period of extremely hot weather with no arrangements for him to be fed or cared for. Defendants contended on appeal that the language of W.Va. Code &sect; 9-6-15(b) was unconstitutionally vague, that the indictments lacked specificity, and that the evidence of their intent was insufficient to sustain a conviction. The appellate court found that the trial court did not err in denying defendants' motion to grant a judgment of acquittal. The statutory language would have clearly alerted a reasonable person to the undesirable, even reprehensible, conduct that was subject to criminal prosecution and penalty. The language was also not so broad as to arguably include, chill, or penalize socially desirable or protected conduct. Defendants were apprised of the charges against them by indictments which tracked the statutory language of the charged offense and by a bill of particulars that set forth the details. Finally, there was strong evidence from which a jury could have inferred intentional neglect and a pattern of neglect over a substantial period of time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to violating W.Va. Code &sect; 17C-5-2, by driving a tractor with a blood alcohol concentration at nearly double the level which gave rise to a statutory presumption of intoxication. He was sentenced to an eight week term of incarceration, and granted a stay of enforcement of the incarceration order to allow him to petition the circuit court for an alternative sentence of home incarceration. The supreme court held that it was inappropriate for the circuit court to have used defendant's ability to pay the costs of home incarceration as a pre-sentencing standard. It held that mandating imprisonment in a jail or correctional facility for indigents, who would otherwise be granted home incarceration, was unconstitutional. Defendant's ability to pay should have been one of the factors which the circuit court used to set the fee for home incarceration, but his economic misfortune should not have been the criteria upon which incarceration was imposed instead of home confinement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmates argued that the prison officials deprived them of their personal computers without due process of law and in retaliation for litigation by &quot;jailhouse lawyers.&quot; The court held that prison inmates had no constitutional right to possess personal computers in their cells. No laws or regulations granted the inmates a property interest in the possession of computers. The prison's policies were insufficient to create a property interest, and thus due process of law was not necessary. The right of meaningful access to the courts did not include the right of inmates to possess computers in their prison cells because prohibiting the possession of personal computers in inmates' cells was a reasonable restriction. The inmates did not have a claim under contract law for detrimental reliance on the prison's policy allowing computers because the relationship between prison administrators and the inmates under their charge was not a contractual one. The inmates failed to state claims for retaliation because each inmate failed to allege that he exercised a fundamental right for which he suffered the removal of his computer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought review of an order entered in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), which dismissed indictments charging defendants with criminal fraud under both W.Va. Code &sect; 5A-3-30 (1990) and W. Va. Code &sect; 61-3-24 (1994).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that the indictments were fatally flawed on the ground that both the State and a contractor were listed as victims under W. Va. Code &sect; 5A-3-30 (1990), which penalized only criminal fraud committed directly against the State, and W. Va. Code &sect; 61-3-24 (1994), which penalized only criminal fraud committed against parties other than the State. Reversing the order dismissing the indictments, the court ruled that charging defendants with a violation of W. Va. Code &sect; 61-3-24 (1994) was not improper because, though the statute did not specifically provide for the State being a potential victim, the statute did not preclude the State from being a member of the group that the legislature sought to protect. The court agreed that the State was the only intended victim under W. Va. Code &sect; 5A-3-30 (1990), but that the erroneous listing of the contractor as a victim did not render the indictments sufficiently flawed to warrant their dismissal. Noting that W.Va. R. Crim. P. 7(e) authorized amendment of indictments, the court concluded that the trial court should have permitted the State to amend the indictments because defendants would not have been prejudiced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order dismissing the indictments against defendants.

Va. Code &sect; 7-14D-1 to -30 (1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act provided for the transfer of retirement fund assets from the public employees retirement system (PERS) to the deputy sheriff fund (Fund). The board refused to permit the transfer of assets for those employed prior to the statutory date, and also refused to allow those individuals hired before July 1, 1998 to enroll in the Fund. The court granted the writ of mandamus. Section 7-14D-8(d) of the Act required the board to seek a judicial determination by writ of mandamus of issues regarding the transfer of assets. The court held that such a statutory &quot;test case&quot; amounted to an advisory opinion. Although courts could not give advisory opinions, the court decided to cautiously address the substantive issues raised by the association. The court held that the board had a fiduciary duty to monitor funds and assets and take all actions necessary to protect those funds. Despite a remote possibility that the transfer of assets from PERS to the Fund could impair the fiscal solvency of PERS, the transfer of assets was not barred because an impairment could be prevented if the board properly performed its fiduciary duty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that even if the SBA and the state board policies did drive consolidation, any such bias toward consolidation was not contrary to any statute nor a violation of the constitutional right to education for appellees, students, parents, and an organization. The court stated that W. Va. Code &sect; 18-9D-16 (1993) did not prohibit the SBA from exercising discretion in weighing and applying the factors listed in &sect; 18-9D-16, in order to prioritize requests for funding. Thus, appellees' statutorily-based attack on the SBA's weighing of the &quot;economies of scale&quot; factor must have failed. The court did not concur with the trial court's conclusion that the SBA and the state board's approach to funding school construction and salaries, and the allegedly resulting closing of the high school, was not a narrowly tailored, least restrictive method necessary to advance a compelling state interest. The court held that the trial court erred in issuing the declaratory judgment and injunction order appealed from in the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sheriff sought a writ of prohibition to prevent respondent circuit court judge from enforcing two administrative orders designating individuals hired by respondent county commission as civilian court marshals. The sheriff alleged that the administrative orders were unconstitutional and an impermissible usurpation of his statutory power under W. Va. Code &sect; 51-3-5 (1923).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ of prohibition in part and denied it in part. In so holding, the court concluded: (1) the county commission's hiring of court security personnel was within its constitutional power to superintend and administer the internal police and fiscal affairs of the county under W. Va. Const. art. IX, &sect; 11 and the commission had the implied authority to employ them under W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 7-1-3m, 7-3-2 (1989); (2) the county commission's employment of these personnel did not impair or supplant the power and duty of the county sheriff under W. Va. Code &sect; 51-3-5 (1923) and W. Va. Trial Ct. R. VII (1960); and (3) although the circuit court judge had the inherent power to provide adequate court security, which was essential to the safe and orderly administration of justice, he improperly usurped the power and responsibility of the sheriff to furnish deputy sheriffs to serve as court bailiffs for the county's courts under W. Va. Code &sect; 51-3-5 (1923) and W. Va. Trial Ct. R. VII. Under the separation of powers doctrine, this usurpatory portion of the judge's order were not permitted to stand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ of prohibition in part, prohibiting the enforcement of the grants of authority to court marshals to perform the courtroom services of bailiff and to escort prisoners to and from court proceedings. The court denied the writ of prohibition as to the remainder of the circuit court judge's order.</SPAN></P>

After conviction, he sought habeas corpus relief. The trial court denied his habeas petition and on appeal he again claimed that the state's failure to elect to try him on either a premeditated murder theory or a felony-murder theory rendered the trial unfair and violated his due process rights. The court affirmed the judgment below, ruling that the state was authorized to present its case on both theories. The two theories were distinguished for the jury in the trial court's charge. Further, because the felon's alibi defense was the same under both murder theories he was not prejudiced by the state's advancement of both theories. In the absence of an arson charge, the jury was not required to distinguish the state's theories of murder in the first degree in its verdict. The court held that premeditated murder and felony-murder were alternative means under W.Va. Code &sect; 61-2-1 (1987) of committing murder in the first degree. The state's reliance on both theories at trial did not, per se, offend due process because they were distinguished for the jury in the instructions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant insurance company's motion to set aside a default judgment and a resulting monetary judgment entered against defendant below and in favor of plaintiff below.

The court reviewed the record and determined that prior to the service of process, the insurer was the insurance carrier for the owner of the vehicle and that defendant was named as an insured under that policy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Secretary of State filed a petition to enjoin appellant nonprofit corporation from soliciting funds until it complied with the Solicitation of Charitable Funds Act (Act), W.

The trial court granted the petition and appellant sought review, asserting that it was not a &quot;charitable organization&quot; under the Act and that the statute violated U.S. Const. amend. I and W. Va. Const. art. 10, &sect; 7. The court affirmed, in part, ruling that appellant was a &quot;charitable organization&quot; as that term was defined in W. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 29-19-2(1) (1992). Appellant's self-description in its articles of incorporation included it within the definition of &quot;charitable organization&quot; found in &sect; 29-19-2(1) and thus, it was subject to the requirements of that Act. Appellant was required to print the mandated statement of &sect; 29-19-8 on its written solicitations. The requirement that a charitable organization &quot;conspicuously display&quot; the mandated statement &quot;on a prominent part of the solicitation materials&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed, in part, holding that &sect; 29-19-8 did not require appellant to provide appellee with a copy of its public mailings.</SPAN></P>

According to the court, the spouses were the &quot;assigns&quot; within the meaning and contract of W. Va.

On appeal, he contended that the circuit court erred in refusing to instruct the jury regarding self-defense, provocation, and certain lesser-included offenses. In addition, he contended there was insufficient evidence upon which to convict him of felony-murder, and that the trial court erred in allowing the testimony of the victim's father, and in refusing to excuse, for cause, two jurors. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that the trial court committed no prejudicial error. The self-defense and provocation instructions were not available in response to a charge of felony-murder because the predicate felony was the delivery of a controlled substance. The court held that, as a matter of law, second-degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter were not lesser included offenses of felony-murder, so the trial court did not err in refusing his proposed instructions. Moreover, the evidence supported the verdict, and although the victim's father's testimony was admitted in error, it was harmless. The court found no error in refusing to strike the challenged jurors for cause.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that the magistrate was not a county employee and the Tort Claims Act did not apply where the defense costs were incurred in connection with criminal charges. The magistrate had none of the indicia of a county officer or employee where the state paid his salary, trained and supervised him, limited his jurisdiction, and set qualifications for his office. The inclusion of magistrates within W. Va. Code &sect; 6-6-7 (1993), affecting removal of county officers, had no bearing on his employment status because it only gave the commission power to file a complaint, not to remove him from office. Although the magistrate was not entitled to reimbursement of attorneys' fees under the Tort Claims Act, he was free to pursue a common law indemnification claim against a state agency if the acts giving rise to the criminal charges were performed in good faith and within the scope of his official duties, and he avoided the constitutional bar against suing a state agency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Board of Education appealed a decision from Circuit Court of Doddridge County (West Virginia), which issued an order to compel it either to readmit plaintiff parents' student son to regular school classes or alternatively to provide him with other state-funded educational services after he had been expelled for possession of a knife on school property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board had ordered that student be expelled from school for a period of 12 months. At trial it stipulated that it was willing to provide a home instruction teacher for four hours per week, provided parents agreed to pay for the teacher's time. The court agreed to consider the questions raised because of their importance, even though the issues were technically moot. The court found that a child could be constitutionally removed from a classroom when he engaged in disruptive conduct. Under the &quot;no weapon&quot; policy, the school could remove student for a substantial period of time. The Productive and Safe School Act, W. Va. Code &sect; 18A-5-1a(g) (1995), was facially constitutional because it was reasonably necessary and narrowly tailored method to provide a safe school environment. However, because the state was constitutionally required to provide a free public education, the board could not condition an instructional program upon parent's reimbursing the board for the cost of the program. On parents' cross appeal that they were wrongfully denied attorney fees, the court found the trial court had failed to consider where extraordinary circumstances existed to allow such fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision which held that student could be removed from school for a period of up to 12 months and that parents could not be required to pay for an instructional program. It remanded the matter of attorney fees for further consideration.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that he was entitled to a hearing on the merits of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. W. Va.

Here the judge simply noted that the allegations were entirely without merit and that good cause for the filing and appointment of counsel was not shown. The court agreed that this order was insufficient.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The realty company brought an action to enjoin a sale of real property by the deputy commissioner to the container company. The trial court denied the realty company's motion for summary judgment and granted appellees' motion. On appeal, the realty company challenged &sect; 11A-3-58 on the ground that it violated W. Va. Const. art. 12, &sect; 4 and the Irreducible School Fund Amendment to the West Virginia Constitution because it mandated that moneys paid to redeem delinquent property were to have been paid to the purchaser of the property and not to the State for use in the general school fund. The court disagreed and declined to evaluate the challenged statute in the abstract, noting that the realty company never attempted to comply with W. Va. Code &sect; 11A-3-58 (1994) and redeem the property, and the provision challenged by the realty company relating to giving redemption moneys to the purchaser of delinquent property was removed. The court concluded that the issues raised by the realty company fell squarely into the category of moot questions.</SPAN></P>

The insurance companies sought writs of prohibition from the state supreme court concerning the conclusion by the Circuit Court of Marshall County (West Virginia) that W. Va. Code &sect; 44-10-14 (1929) required court approval of all such settlements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two consolidated lawsuits, the complaints alleged violations of W. Va. Code &sect; 33-11-4(9) (1985), the unfair claims settlement practices, the tort of outrage, and fraud. The parents and infant contended that the insurance companies paid money to and obtained settlement releases from them, where there was no litigation pending, to settle tort claims against the insurance companies' insureds in &quot;infant settlements,&quot; in a fashion that was wrongful, illegal, and actionable. The circuit court stated that W. Va. Code &sect; 44-10-14 (1929) required an infant settlement proceeding where a minor was injured in his person or property. The issue was whether &sect; 44-10-14 required court approval of all infant settlements. The court held that the statutory language plainly contemplated that both parties to an infant settlement, the guardian and the tort-feasor, could elect not to proceed under the provisions of the statutory section in question. Section 44-10-14 did not require court approval of all claims where a guardian executed a settlement agreement on behalf of a minor who had been injured in his or her person or property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Jefferson County Planning and Zoning Commission's found that the subdivision standards of Jefferson County, W. Va., Subdivision Ordinance &sect; 4.8.a applied to an access road and denied appellant developer a variance. The developer challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jefferson County (West Virginia), which affirmed the Commission's decisions and found that the Ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer sought to construct single family residences. The Ordinance provided that a road accessing subdivision had to meet the standards required for rights-of-way and roads and required a developer who used an existing access road to upgrade it to the Ordinance's asphalt standards. The developer sought a variance and offered to upgrade the access road, but not to the subdivision standards. The Commission denied the variance. The court held that the Commission did not err in interpreting the Ordinance, but it did err in failing to set forth the factual basis for its denial of the variance. The circuit court correctly concluded that Jefferson County, W. Va., Subdivision Ordinance &sect;&sect; 4.8 and 8.2 were applicable to the proposed subdivision roads and to the access road. All sections of the Ordinance had to be applied to the access road. The Ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because it provided a reasonable notice of the important issues to those seeking a variance. The Commission's minutes did not reflect the reasons why it denied the variance. Findings of fact were necessary for a proper review by both the court and the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence at trial showed that defendant entered two restaurants, pointed a gun at the employees, and told them that he would kill them if they did not cooperate in giving him money. He kidnapped one of the employees while leaving the restaurant, and after being spotted by the police, drove in excess of 125 miles per hour with the employee in the car. Defendant argued that because he used an air pistol to commit the robberies, he was entitled to an instruction on the lesser included offense of nonaggravated robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence. The court held that the only element that differed from aggravated robbery was the violence or threat of violence to the victims. The court ruled that because the presence of a firearm was not required for a conviction of aggravated robbery, and the evidence showed that defendant threatened the victims with a weapon, which they believed was real, defendant was not entitled to an instruction on nonaggravated robbery. The court further determined that defendant's sentence was constitutionally proportionate to the character and degree of the offenses of which he was convicted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee pension fund (the fund) was created under W. Va. Code &sect; 12-6-9(j).

X, &sect; 6, which prohibited the state from becoming an owner or stockholder in a company or association, and issued a writ of quo warranto dissolving the fund as an illegal corporation, the fund appealed. The court affirmed the finding that the West Virginia Trust Fund Act, W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 44-6B-1 to -12 (1996), was unconstitutional. The fund was to a significant degree a state actor and instrumentality of the state. The fund allowed the state to invest employee pension, the workers' compensation, and coal workers' pneumoconiosis funds to become a joint owner or stockholder in companies and associations. The court reversed in part. The court disagreed with the finding that the act interfered with the duties of the state treasurer.

The court held that the legislature expressly modified the usual, ordinary meaning of subrogation as it was used in &sect; 23-2A-1 by mandating that the commissioner in a subrogation claim was be limited to recovering only the medical benefits paid as of the date of recovery, and could not collect more than fifty percent of the amount received from the third party as a result of the employee's claim.</SPAN></P>

The state further requested the prohibition of respondent officials from refusing to enforce violations of W. Va. Code &sect; 20-2-5(10).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ. W. Va. Const., art. III, &sect; 22 permitted a person to keep and bear arms for lawful hunting and recreational use. The court found that applying &sect; 22 to W. Va. Code &sect; 20-2-5(10) demonstrated that there was no conflict between the two provisions because transportation of a loaded firearm was not a lawful method of hunting with firearms. The court determined that, as an unlawful manner of hunting, the transportation of a loaded firearm was not subject to constitutional protection. The court also found that a review of &sect; 20-2-5(10) indicated that it was a reasonable and narrow restriction of a person's right to bear arms. The court determined that the state had a legitimate police power interest in protecting its citizens from the dangers of transporting loaded firearms. The court concluded that the restriction was reasonable because it did not infringe upon a sportsperson's right to keep and bear arms for hunting purposes, but rather, it merely regulated the manner in which such weapons could be transported.</SPAN></P>

Va. R. Evid. 404(b), as the error was harmless because the question did not have a prejudicial effect on the jury; (3) separation of the charges into four counts did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution or the West Virginia Constitution because each count required proof of separate facts; (4) defense counsel was not permitted to impeach a co-defendant with a prior misdemeanor conviction for shoplifting because the conviction did not involve dishonesty or a false statement, and (5) the case was remanded because the state failed to explain why it did not challenge a similarly situated juror in the face of defendant's Batson challenge.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 27-6A-3 and 27-6A-4 (1992 &amp; Supp. 1996) took effect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For several years before defendant shot and killed her husband, she suffered from varying degrees of mental illness. Following her arrest, the trial court ordered her to undergo hospitalization. After six months of evaluation, defendant was found to suffer from bipolar affective disorder with psychotic features and was found competent to stand trial. However, the evaluation showed that she did not form the criminal intent necessary for a conviction at the time of the murder. Thereafter, the trial court continued the matter in order for an amendment to &sect;&sect; 27-6A-3 and 27-6A-4 to take effect in 1996. The trial court concluded that it was able to maintain jurisdiction over defendant for 18 years, which was the maximum sentence for a second-degree murder conviction. At a hearing, defendant was found guilty by reason of insanity and hospitalized. Considering defendant's mental state, the court held that &sect;&sect; 27-6A-3 and 27-6A-4 provided the trial court with flexibility in exercising and retaining its jurisdiction up to the maximum sentence period. The court further held that the trial court's implementation of the amended version of &sect; 27-6A-3 did not violate ex post facto principles.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the SBA was permitted to issue revenue bonds in a principal amount greater than the principal amount of the bonds to be refunded in order to establish an escrow account for the repayment of those preexisting obligations that were not presently due and payable. But the court held that the SBA was permitted to issue refunding bonds only in that additional amount required to establish and maintain the escrow account. The court further held that the SBA was not permitted to issue bonds alleged to be refunding bonds for the redemption of the previous obligations, which had the practical effect of generating cash at closing in order to make immediately available to the SBA the anticipated debt service savings from the so-called refunding bonds.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the writ, holding that while appellee forfeited his right to attend the junior high school by bringing a firearm to school, he had not forfeited his right to an education. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because education was a fundamental, constitutional right in West Virginia, appellant had to demonstrate a compelling state interest to justify its refusal to provide alternative education to appellee. The court held that the lack of financial resources, standing alone, was not a compelling state interest to justify appellant's denial of appellee's constitutional right to an education.

The court held that when evaluating whether an injunction's content-neutral restrictions on speech in a public forum was constitutional, the reviewing court had to ensure that the content-neutral restrictions in the injunction burden no more speech than necessary to serve a significant government interest. The court explained that injunctions carried greater risks of censorship and discriminatory application than ordinances. Further, the court noted that an injunction represented a remedy imposed for a violation while an ordinance represented a legislative choice. For these reasons, the court concluded that the standard time, place, and manner analysis used to determine the constitutionality of an ordinance was not sufficiently rigorous for examining the constitutionality of an injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant sought review of an order from the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), which denied his prayer for a declaratory judgment that the provisions of W.Va. Code &sect; 23-4-22 (1993) were unconstitutional and which refused to require appellee Commissioner of the Division of Workers' Compensation, Bureau of Employment Programs (commissioner) to evaluate claimant's entitlement to permanent partial disability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant suffered a leg injury and filed a worker's compensation claim. The injury was ruled compensable on a no lost time basis. No permanent partial evaluation was made and the commissioner did not file an order closing the claim. The state legislature subsequently passed &sect; 23-4-22. The day before its effective date, the claimant's counsel requested permanent partial disability evaluations for all claims being handled by counsel's law firm which could have been affected by the bill. The request was denied. The commissioner later denied a specific request for an evaluation of the claimant. The claimant filed a declaratory judgment action. The circuit court denied relief. The court reversed and remanded. The court found that &sect; 23-4-22 was inapplicable to the claimant's situation because the statute, on its face, applied only to cases closed on a no lost time basis. The court determined that the commissioner acted only through his orders, and as no order closing the case had been issued, the claimant's case was still open. The court concluded that the claimant's request for a permanent disability evaluation was effective on the date his counsel made a request for his evaluation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and remanded with directions that the circuit court enter an order consistent with the court's opinion with respect to the claimant's rights under W.Va. Code &sect; 23-4-22 (1993) relative to his request for a permanent disability evaluation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant municipality sought review from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Cabell County (West Virginia), which entered an award of damages to plaintiff property owner due to defendant's delay in giving plaintiff a requested building permit. Defendant contended that it was error to deny its motion to dismiss the state claim, that the evidence was insufficient, and that his due process rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner filed an action against defendant municipality, alleging that a delay by defendant in issuing a requested building permit caused damages, including additional costs for having to build during the winter. The trial court entered judgment for plaintiff based upon a jury verdict, and defendant sought review. The court reversed, holding that liability under state law claims was barred by the West Virginia Immunity Statute,&nbsp;W. Va. Code &sect; 29-12A-5(a), because absolute immunity applied. The court held that defendant could be held liable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 as an entity when the plaintiff's injury resulted from a municipal policy or custom, and it found that actions of the planning supervisor and planning commission constituted official policy of defendant. However, the court held that plaintiff had received a process which was due, pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and that the four-month delay did not violate his due process rights, in that he did not show that the procedures were unfair or otherwise deficient. Accordingly, the court dismissed the action.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect;&sect; 60A-7-703, 60A-7-704, 60A-4-401. At issue was the application of U.S. Const. Amend. V, and W.Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was indicted for two counts of delivery of a controlled substance within 1,000 feet of a school and one count of delivery of a controlled substance. At the time the indictment was returned, the state filed a petition for forfeiture of the owner's truck pursuant to the provisions of W.Va. Code &sect;&sect; 60A-7-703 and 60A-7-704 on the ground that the truck had been used to transport or in any manner facilitate the transportation, sale, receipt, possession or concealment of any controlled substance, in violation of W.Va. Code &sect; 60A-4-401. The owner pled guilty, and shortly thereafter, the trial court granted the State's petition for the civil forfeiture of the truck. On appeal, the court rejected the owner's claim that the granting of the State's petition for civil forfeiture, after he had already pled guilty to the criminal acts supporting the forfeiture, was unconstitutional under the double jeopardy provisions of U.S. Const. Amend. V, and W.Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of first-degree murder, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The trial court balanced the propriety of allowing testimony of outstanding charges against defendant, as opposed to merely allowing testimony that defendant was actively being sought by authorities for other felony charges, and it concluded that the former was too prejudicial but that the probative value of the latter was not outweighed by its prejudicial effect. It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to reject defendant's instruction because the matter was covered in the trial court's charge. The testimony of police concerning their conversations with others was not hearsay because it was not presented to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Assuming the officers' testimony was not relevant, the error was harmless. Other evidence that was objected to by defendant was relevant, and the probative value of the evidence outweighed any prejudice that could have been associated with the introduction of the evidence. The trial court's decision to deny bifurcation was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The political party filed a petition of its intention to place the candidates on the general election ballot, submitted over 20,000 signatures endorsing the petition, and filed the filing fee. The Secretary refused the application because he claimed that the July 2 deadline as calculated under W. Va. Code &sect; 3-5-23(a) (1986) had expired. The Secretary argued that the declarations of candidacy and the fees were due at least 30 days prior to the filing of the certificate provided by W. Va. Code &sect; 3-5-24 (1963) and that the term &quot;declaration&quot; referred to W. Va. Code &sect; 3-5-7 (1991), which required candidates to file a certificate of announcement of their nomination. In granting the writ of mandamus, the court noted that &sect; 3-5-7(f) applied only to primary elections and not general elections. Further, the proviso in W. Va. Code &sect; 3-5-23(a) (1986) provided that the deadline for filing the certificate and fees for seeking ballot access as candidates for president or vice president could be filed no later than the first day of August preceding the general election.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Workers' compensation claimants filed a writ of mandamus against the Commissioner of the Division of Workers' Compensation, Bureau of Employment Programs, challenging the constitutionality of certain provisions of Senate Bill 250, which amended the West Virginia Workers' Compensation Act. The court determined that only one claimant was sufficiently affected by one of the provisions of Senate Bill 250. That claimant had filed a petition to reopen his work-related injury for consideration for permanent total disability three days after the effective date of Senate Bill 250, and his request was denied on the ground that he did not meet the requirements of W. Va. Code &sect; 23-4-6(n)(1) (1995) in that he had received a total 32 percent whole man impairment. The court determined that the denial of claimant's request to reopen his claim because he did not suffer a medical impairment of 50 percent was not unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection under W.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claiming that the Act was unconstitutional, the clerk refused to publish a notice of a public hearing under the Act for the issuance of the bonds to finance a county water project. The commission sought a writ of mandamus to compel the clerk to publish a notice of a hearing. The court denied the writ. When the bonds were issued under the Act, a debt was created. Such a debt could only have been issued under W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 8, which stated that a county, city, or municipal corporation could not incur a debt unless it provided for the collection of a direct annual tax on all taxable property therein. If a county increased its current debt or created a new debt, it had to adjust its taxes to pay the debt. The Act provided that the increased ad valorem taxes generated as a result of the development project would pay the bonds. The Act used tax revenues derived from existing regular levies, making the Act unconstitutional. The bonds issued under the Act violated W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 8. Thus, the county commission did not have a legal right to continue the process to fund the water project.</SPAN></P>

In response to information provided by Nebraska officials, appellee Interstate Compact Administrator (administrator) issued an order authorizing the police to apprehend the patient and to take him to the West Virginia state mental hospital. In his petition, the patient challenged the procedure used to return an escaped dangerous or potentially dangerous patient, which was set forth in the Compact. The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the patient was not denied procedural due process. The court found that the patient was informed of the reason he was being detained, was afforded a hearing to determine identification, and was afforded the opportunity to have the representation of counsel at the hearing. The court rejected the patient's contention that due process required that a mental hygiene commissioner, magistrate, or judge issue the order to detain a mental patient, rather than the administrator.

The jury returned a verdict in favor of the employee, and the designer filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, a new trial. The Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia) denied the designer's motion, and the designer challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The designer owned the aluminum fabrication facility and designed the facility's hotline. Two years before the employee's accident the designer sold the facility to the employer. The designer alleged that the employee's claim of negligent design was barred under W. Va. Code &sect; 55-2-6a (1983), the statute of repose. The court disagreed and held that &sect; 55-2-6a was not intended to extend repose to a defendant such as the designer, which not only designed, but also owned, the equipment. The court determined that the statutory language contemplated that someone other than the owner of the real property had performed the enumerated activities or services and, therefore, would have had the benefit of repose. The court also held that the hotline equipment in question was real property. Finally, the court held that the measure of damages for the employee's past wages was adequately supported, but the testimony regarding the damages for future lost wages was highly speculative and could not have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

The officer believed that defendant had failed to appear for a traffic citation and that he had a runaway petition filed against him. Defendant accompanied the officer to the station and he was placed under arrest. Defendant was searched and crack cocaine was discovered on his person. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress and adjudged him a delinquent. The court reversed and remanded the case. The court determined that there was no warrant for defendant's arrest for a failure to appear. The court found that, pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 49-5-8(b)(3), a juvenile could be taken into custody without a warrant or court order if the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the juvenile was a runaway and that the health, safety, and welfare of the child was endangered. The court noted that a records check indicated that a runaway petition had been filed against defendant. However, there was no evidence that defendant's health, safety, or welfare was endangered. Therefore, since no lawful custodial arrest existed, the search of defendant was invalid and the crack cocaine should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first offense driving under the influence of alcohol. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in refusing to quash the indictment on the grounds that the indictment charged an offense which the state could not possibly prove. The court ruled that a valid indictment or presentment could be made only by a grand jury, and that no court could make an indictment in the first instance or alter or amend the substance of an indictment returned by a grand jury. Further, the court held that a variation that had the effect of actually or constructively amending the indictment required reversal, whereas one that added nothing to the indictment could constitute harmless error. Also, the court found that the fact that the proof at trial differed from the allegations in the indictment was not reversible error. The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant, concluding that the factual allegations for first offense driving under the influence of alcohol were set forth in the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Superintendent (superintendent) of the Division of Public Safety (division), sought review of the order of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), which directed the payment of a judgment in favor of appellee police officers by January 31, 1996. Petitioner superintendent also sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, state auditor and state treasurer, not to pay the judgment out of the division's account.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers obtained a judgment for unpaid overtime. The circuit court ordered the judgment paid by January 31, 1996. The superintendent claimed that the state police would run out of money by April, 1996 if the judgment was paid from the division's current budget. The superintendent sought review of the circuit court's order and petitioned for a writ of mandamus to compel the treasurer and auditor not to pay the judgment out of the division's current budget. The court reversed the circuit court's order because the executive department and the legislature had several options in order to discharge the judgment, a previous liability of the State of West Virginia (state). Further, it was not for a court to choose among the alternatives. However, the legislature's mandate, that it was in its discretion as to whether it would pay judgment interest, violated the Due Process Clauses of the United States and West Virginia Constitutions because interest was a valid obligation of the state, pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 56-6-31 (1981). Finally, the writ of mandamus was granted because the superintendent had the clear right not to have the judgment paid from the division's current budget.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital provided computerized tomography (CT) service to its patients by having a third party outside the hospital perform the service. After the third party's contract expired with the hospital, the hospital transported patients requiring CT service to another hospital far away. The hospital then attempted to purchase its own CT service machine. The Authority required that before the hospital could purchase the machine, it had to undergo a Certificate of Need (CON) review. The hospital filed suit, claiming that it did not have to have a CON. The court upheld the CON order and the hospital challenged the ruling. The court held that under state law, the hospital was required to undergo a CON review if it was providing new service. The court stated that the legislation was ambiguous in this instance, since it was unknown whether the law applied to a hospital that had a CT service provided by a third party. The court concluded that because the legislation was unclear, the Authority was acting within its administrative authority in requiring the CON. The court upheld the lower court, and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the trial court's order that imposed consecutive imprisonment sentences on him, 1 to 15 years for each of the delivery convictions and one to five years for the conspiracy conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police apprehended a buyer of cocaine and marijuana. In exchange for the buyer's participation in their investigation, he was not prosecuted. The buyer bought more drugs with marked money and returned to the police. The buyer asserted that defendant had sold the drugs to him. The police apprehended defendant when he fled. A drug-sniffing dog located the marked money a short distance from defendant's apprehension point. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's contention that the marked money was erroneously admitted for lack of a proper foundation and relevance. Trial testimony adequately established a nexus between the money and defendant. Defendant was not entitled to directed verdicts on any of the charges because there was sufficient evidence for the jury to return guilty verdicts. Defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy was not violated by the consecutive sentences for the separate offenses of marijuana and cocaine because the delivery of each substance was a separate violation of the law. Defendant was not entitled to the abbreviated sentencing consideration under W. Va. Code &sect; 60A-4-401(a) because he was simultaneously convicted of more serious offenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a murder trial, defendant argued that he suffered from &quot;diminished capacity.&quot; The court held that: (1) defendant's intolerant and hostile relationship and behavior towards his son showed that he acted with deliberation and premeditation; (2) a defense expert's excluded testimony provided no factual basis from which to infer that defendant could not intend the consequences of his actions; (3) there was likewise no evidence to support a jury charge that defendant suffered from a specific mental defect that rendered him incapable of forming a specific intent to kill; (4) historical evidence of uncharged prior acts was admissible because it was inextricably intertwined with the charged crime and the continued pattern of physical and mental abuse defendant inflicted on his son was also relevant to show intent, motive, malice, and the absence of accident; (5) trial courts had discretionary authority to bifurcate trials under W.

Va. Code &sect;&sect; 46A-6D-1 to 10 (1992). The Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia) found that there was reasonable cause to believe that the corporation engaged in deceptive or misleading conduct and granted the preliminary relief. The corporation appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation argued that there was not a specific finding that any of the direct mail solicitations amounted to material misrepresentations and that the solicitations in their totality contained nothing more than standard puffing, which was an acceptable and lawful practice when attempting to sell a product. The corporation also argued that its solicitations were protected as commercial speech. The court rejected the corporation's arguments. The court found that the State only had to prove by minimal evidence that the corporation was engaging in conduct that violated West Virginia Prizes and Gifts Act, W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 46A-6D-1 to 10 (1992). There was sufficient evidence that the solicitations were ambiguous and did not represent a clear and meaningful disclosure. The granting of temporary relief under W. Va. Code &sect; 46A-7-110 (1974) for a violation of the West Virginia Prize and Gifts Act was more narrow than the typical motion for a preliminary injunction. The court applied a four-part test when it determined that the corporation's deceptive solicitations were not protected as commercial speech. The court objected to the absence of any time constraints within the injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment but modified the temporary injunction by limiting its duration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer claimed that the publishing of the proposed constitutional amendment in summary form in every county but one violated W.Va. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 2 and, therefore was unconstitutional. The court however, affirmed the constitutionality of the amendment. In doing so, the court applied de novo review because the circuit court interpreted a provision of the constitution. The court held that the publication in summary form was proper because it substantially complied with a procedural requirement within art. XIV, &sect; 2. The court reasoned that under this &quot;substantial compliance&quot; test there was no mechanical formula to have been applied, but rather the court had to determine whether in this particular case did the deviation from the procedural requirement of full text publication prevent a true expression of the voters' will. The amendment was valid because it was endorsed by two-thirds of the legislature, a majority of the voters approved it, the legislatively approved summary was published in a timely fashion in all but one county, and the it was more clear then the full text and excluded no material terms. However, the court cautioned against such further deviations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After losing a levy at the polls, the board established a book user fee for non-needy school children, whom it defined as those children not participating in the free or reduced school lunch program. When parents refused to pay the fee on the grounds that it violated the &quot;free schools&quot; clause, W. Va. Const. art. XII, &sect; 1, the board filed an action for declaratory judgment to direct that payment. The trial court agreed with the parents that the fee was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that whatever items were deemed necessary to accomplish the goals of a school system and were in fact an integral fundamental part of the elementary and secondary education had to be provided free of charge to all students in order to comply with the constitutional mandate of a &quot;free school&quot; system. The court determined that the textbooks in this case were such an integral fundamental part of education, holding that hindering access to necessary materials would make the educational process nearly meaningless. The court rejected the board's claim of financial hardship, ruling that it was no defense to a violation of the &quot;free school&quot; guarantee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, state employer, auditor, and treasurer, sought review of judgment in favor of appellee employees in a mandamus proceeding for unpaid wages under West Virginia Wage and Hour Law, W. Va. Code &sect; 21-5C-1 et seq., an overtime exemption to wage laws for state troopers that was declared unconstitutional. The court rejected appellants' argument that sovereign immunity and separation of powers precluded the lower court from ordering the payment of a monetary award from the state treasury general funds. The court explained that appellees' claim for back overtime pay was not barred by the immunity provision of W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 35 because a state official, not the state, was sued in the mandamus proceeding to require the performance of a nondiscretionary function of paying appellees according to certain terms as the legislature had required. The court further observed the award of overtime was prospective relief only, and the constitutional bar to retroactive relief was not an issue that had to be confronted because the lower court's order of prospective relief acquired preclusive effect against appellants, who were in privity with litigants in the wage exemption case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed judgment in favor of appellee employees in a mandamus proceeding against appellants, state employer, auditor, and treasurer, because sovereign immunity principles did not preclude an order requiring payment of back pay when such relief was prospective only, and mandamus was not directed at the state but instead at state officials in their official capacity to compel the performance of a nondiscretionary duty required by law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff power companies (companies) appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), which found that a legislative regulation, 110 W. Va. Code St. R. 13 &sect; 1a.2.11 (1990), was a valid and enforceable regulation properly interpreting W. Va. Code &sect; 11-13-2n(a)(1) (1990). In reaching its decision, the circuit court found there was no express or implied deduction for company use or line loss provided in &sect; 11-13-2n(a)(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies argued that &sect; 11-13-2n(a)(1) was clear and unambiguous in excluding company use and line loss from the calculation of net generation of electricity available for sale and violated equal protection principles by excluding manufacturers that generated electric power for their own use without providing similar exclusions for the companies, which generated electricity for sale. Defendant state tax department (department) argued that production taxes were traditionally based on quantities produced for sale and not on quantities actually delivered to the retail market and the department's interpretation was entitled to great weight. The court held that the department's interpretation excluding line loss and company use deductions was a well-reasoned and rational decision that comported with the language of the statute. When a court reached the same reading of a statute as a practical construction given it by the enforcing agency, that was a powerful weight supporting such reading. The statute did not violate equal protection because the differences in the rights and duties of a public utility and a nonutility justified the separate classification in which each was included.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant was a magistrate court clerk who resigned her position in order to run for a non-judicial public office.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both relators were convicted of violations of W. Va.

According to the relators, the State failed to prove the victims were 11 years old or less. The victims in both cases were approximately 11 years and 8 months. The realtors asserted that under the statutory language a crime was only committed if the victim was 11 years old or less. Consequently, the relators argued that once a person reached his or her 11th birthday, he or she had already lived 11 years and any time after the 11th birthday made such a person beyond the age of 11. The State countered with the argument that the common meaning of being 11 years of age encompassed those months until the person reached their 12th birthday. The court held that W. Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee applicant applied to the circuit court for a license to carry a concealed deadly weapon under &sect; 61-7-4. The circuit court denied the license, holding that issuance of such a license was an exercise of the state's police power and therefore it lacked jurisdiction to issue the license. The circuit court certified the question to the court. The court answered the question and held that &sect; 61-7-4 was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 61-7-4 was an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the circuit courts in violation of W. Va. Const. art. V, &sect; 1, the separation of powers doctrine. The regulation of the right to carry a concealed deadly weapon was exclusively a legislative function because it involved no case or controversy as the circuit court had no discretion to deny the license if the applicant met &sect; 61-7-4's requirements. The court ordered that its ruling be applied prospectively.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the relator's petition for a writ of prohibition because the trial judge's unjustified unilateral modification of a specific and judicially accepted plea agreement violated Rule 11. A circuit court has no authority on its own to vacate or modify a validly accepted guilty plea under Rule 11(e)(1)(C) because of subsequent events that do not impugn the validity of the original plea agreement, absent a showing of fraud. The trial judge's attempt to modify the sentencing decision, and impose new conditions on the relator, constituted a clear violation of the prohibition against judicial involvement in plea bargaining under Rule 11.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant revenue department appealed from the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), which ruled adversely to it in ordering release of a large sum plus accrued interest to appellee taxpayer, even though it affirmed an administrative law judge's ruling that alternative minimum tax (AMT) was constitutional. The revenue department challenged the ruling that AMT could not be applied on a pro rata basis.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the Legislature could have provided for repeal of AMT to relate back to the beginning of the year, and because the repealing statute expressly provided that it would not take effect for 90 days from passage of House Bill 2587, the Legislature expressly intended to permit utilizing AMT until July 7, 1989. There was no error in pro rata assessment. Although AMT was not assessed against the taxpayer on July 6, AMT and liability to pay the tax on assessment already accrued before reenactment of West Virginia Code &sect; 19-23-9(b)(3) minus AMT. The Legislature expressly provided for using pro rata accounting for a shortened racing year. The legislative omission of repeal as a specific instance warranting pro rata assessment of AMT tax did not prevent such assessment. Rather, the express delineation of conditions warranting pro rata application of the AMT tax supported assessing it on a pro rata basis due to the tax's mid-year repeal. The pari-mutuel AMT, previously in West Virginia Code &sect; 19-23-9(b)(3) (1987), but repealed through House Bill 2587, was properly utilized to assess on a pro rata basis the amount of pari-mutuel wagering taxes owed by the state's dog track licensees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1978, the taxpayers excluded federal civil service retirement income from their state income tax. In 1979, the commissioner informed the taxpayers that the income was not deductible until the taxpayer husband reached age 65, in 1985. The taxpayers did not appeal or challenge the determination. In 1990, following a United States Supreme Court decision, the taxpayers filed a petition for a tax refund for the years 1978 to 1984. Applying the applicable statute of limitations, the commissioner denied the petition. The circuit court reversed the commissioner's decision based upon the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The court reversed and remanded the circuit court's decision and held that the taxpayers failed to timely challenge the commissioner's decision under W. Va. Code &sect; 11-10-14(d) (1995). The taxpayers did not file a refund claim within the limitation period of W. Va. Code &sect; 11-10-14(1) (1995). The doctrine of equitable estoppel was inapplicable because the commissioner's 1979 response was an accurate statement of West Virginia law. Nothing in the commissioner's response constituted an affirmative act that induced the taxpayers to refrain from challenging his decision.</SPAN></P>

He was originally sentenced to an indeterminate term of not less than five nor more than 18 years in the penitentiary. When he turned 18, he was returned to the trial court to permit reconsideration and modification of his sentence. At that time the judge ordered his confinement in youthful offender center for six months or longer, but no more than two years. The prisoner sought release after he had successfully completed the youthful offender program. On appeal, the court granted the writ, and ordered the prisoner released. The court found that although sentencing the prisoner under the youthful offender statute was technically improper in light of his age at the time he committed the crime, in that he was too young, this particular infirmity did not render the sentence illegal or void ab initio. The court reasoned that a sentence which was technically infirm, but generally and substantially complied with the spirit and purpose of the law, was not void, but merely voidable. The court then found that the State waived the objection by its failure to object when the youthful offender sentence was imposed.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the legislative veto contained within the APA was unconstitutional, and that W. Va. Code &sect; 29A-3-12(b) violated the separation of powers requirement of W. Va.

The circuit court judge issued a writ of mandamus, which a new judge vacated. The circuit court judge ruled that &sect; 7-5-22 did not violate W. Va. Const. art. V, &sect; 1; art. X, &sect; 1; or art. III, &sect; 10. The court accepted the appeal on certified question of whether W. Va. Code &sect; 7-5-22 was unconstitutional. The court found &sect; 7-5-22 constitutional and held that the solid waste assessment fee authorized by &sect; 7-5-22 was a regulatory fee rather than a tax, and, therefore, &sect; 7-5-22 did not violate W. Va. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 or W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 1. The solid waste assessment fee imposed by W. Va. Code &sect; 7-5-22 was rationally related to the legitimate governmental purpose of defraying the administrative costs of the regional and county solid waste authorities and their solid waste programs. The imposition of the fee was not arbitrary and unreasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question and held that the disputed statute, which authorized solid waste authorities to impose a solid waste assessment fee, did not violate the state constitution. The court also remanded the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court held that the boundary adjustment was invalid and allowed relief through a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city sought and obtained an annexation by a minor boundary adjustment under W. Va. Code &sect; 8-6-5 (1989) of property along W. Va. Route 3 and three adjacent parcels. There was no opposition to the annexation by the freeholders at the commission's public hearing. The city claimed that the fire departments, as non-freeholders, had no standing to challenge the annexation and that the circuit court erred in holding that the annexation was invalid. On appeal, the court agreed with the city and ordered the annexation affirmed. Although the circuit court was correct that the fire departments lacked standing to bring a writ of certiorari, it erred by granting a writ of prohibition because prohibition could only be directed against judicial officials. Moreover, the circuit court erred in determining that the annexation was not a proper boundary adjustment because the property was sufficiently contiguous to the city limits. Finally, noting that annexation was essentially a legislative matter and that the commission enjoyed broad discretion, the court held that the judiciary should not have intruded upon the commission unless the process was unconstitutional or invalid.</SPAN></P>

The criminal and the driver filed petitions seeking to prohibit a trial judge from denying a jury trial de novo in the circuit court on appeal from a criminal conviction in a magistrate court. The court granted the criminal's petition and denied the driver's petition. The court held that the procedural amendments eliminating the right to a trial by jury on appeal from the magistrate court criminal proceeding did not violate state or federal constitutions. However, because the record failed to reflect whether the criminal was given the opportunity to voluntarily waive his right to a trial by jury under the amended statute, the criminal was entitled to that opportunity.

The constitutional language could not be read as proscribing only those type of historical credit for stock transactions, which served as the impetus for the enactment of art. X, &sect; 6. Instead, the clearly-stated proscription against the state becoming an owner of corporate stock was read in accordance with its clear and plainly-stated terms. The court concluded that W. Va.

A complaint was filed with the city clerk seeking to remove the candidate from the ballot. The candidate then filed his mandamus action seeking a ruling that the 60 day durational affiliation requirement in W. Va. Code, 3-5-7(b)(6) was unconstitutional. The court found that the requirement was constitutional and denied the requested writ of mandamus. A restriction on the right to run for public office was to be upheld only if the restriction advanced a state interest of compelling importance and the state did not have a less restrictive means of satisfying that legitimate state goal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father and mother divorced. The mother was granted custody of their two daughters, and the father was granted visitation rights. Based on allegations of the father's sexual molestation of the children, the mother petitioned for modification of visitation. After hearing evidence presented by the parties, the family master found that the father had sexually molested one of the daughters and had &quot;probably&quot; molested the other. The master recommended that visitation be terminated until the father's completion of psychological treatment and that he pay the costs and attorney fees. The circuit court rejected the master's findings and issued its own. On appeal, the court considered whether the circuit court violated W. Va. Code &sect; 48A-4-20(c) (1993) when it conducted a de novo review of the findings of fact made by the family law master. The court held that the standard of review for a circuit court was controlled by the &sect; 48A-4-20(c) and that a circuit court should review findings of fact made by a family law master only under a &quot;clearly erroneous&quot; standard and that it should review the application of law to the facts under an &quot;abuse of discretion&quot; standard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner driver appealed a judgment entered by the Circuit Court of Berkeley County (West Virginia), affirming an administrative order issued by respondent, the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), revoking his driver's license. After the driver was arrested for his second offense of driving under the influence of alcohol, he had requested and received an administrative hearing under W. Va. Code, 17C-5A-2 (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's hearing was twice continued at the Commissioner's request. The DMV mailed petitioner's counsel a letter on April 24, 1990, stating that the hearing had been rescheduled for May 3. By letter dated April 26, counsel replied to the notice via certified mail, return receipt requested, asking for a continuance because counsel already had two court hearings scheduled on May 3. The letter arrived at the post office on Friday, April 27, but the DMV did not pick up its mail until Monday, April 30. The DMV refused petitioner's request for a continuance because it was not received at least five days prior to the scheduled hearing date, as required by a DMV rule. The driver appeared at the hearing without counsel, and his license was revoked. On appeal, the court held that the DMV violated the driver's due process rights under the federal and state constitutions. Petitioner's counsel demonstrated &quot;good cause&quot; for the continuance and made a reasonable effort to meet the five-day rule by using certified mail, return receipt requested; he was not required to use overnight mail service. Although facially reasonable, the rule was unreasonably applied under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant, inter alia, with concealing stolen property and transferring stolen property. The indictment named the owner of the stolen goods. Before trial, the state discovered that the stolen property actually belonged to relative of the person named as the owner and filed a motion to amend the indictment. The trial court granted the motion and defendant was convicted. On appeal, he argued that the court's decision in McGraw v. State, 85 S.E.2d 849 (1955), required reversal of his conviction. The court noted that in McGraw it had held that changing the name of the owner of stolen property rendered an indictment invalid. The court reconsidered its holding in McGraw and modified it to the extent that it stood for the proposition that any change to an indictment required resubmission to the jury. The court announced a new rule that an indictment could be amended by the trial court provided the amendment was not substantial, was sufficiently definite and certain, did not take defendant by surprise and so long as any evidence defendant had before the amendment was equally available after amendment. The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

The abutting landowners accepted the highway commissioner's offer to purchase the northern part of the property, but the prospective buyer claimed that he would purchase the entire property if it were sold at a public auction. The abutting landowners and the highway commissioner argued that &sect; 17-2A-19 required that the abutting landowners be given a right of first refusal of the property at fair market value (FMV). However, the prospective buyer argued, and the circuit court found, that &sect; 17-2A-19 did not require a right of first refusal, and that the highway commissioner had to obtain the highest and best price for the property. On appeal, the court reversed the grant of summary judgment to the prospective buyer, because the highway commissioner had the right to decide whether the property would be useful in the present or foreseeable future, and once that decision was made, he had to first offer the property to the abutting landowners for FMV. Moreover, he had determined the FMV in an unbiased manner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original action, relator, the State Board of Education, sought a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, the State Auditor and the State Treasurer, to approve a salary increase for the Board's Superintendent. The Board urged that W. Va. Code, 6-7-2a (1989), which set the salaries of numerous executive officers, unconstitutionally fixed the salary of the Superintendent, the Board's appointee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board contended that, under its constitutional authority generally to supervise public education, it, rather than the Legislature, was entitled to fix the salary of its appointee, the Superintendent, and that, therefore, the Legislature's attempt to set the Superintendent's salary in W. Va. Code, 6-7-2a (1989), was unconstitutional. The court noted that &sect; 2 of Article XII of the West Virginia Constitution empowered the Board to select the Superintendent but that &sect; 2 did not authorize the Board to set the Superintendent's salary. Section 8 of Article IV of the West Virginia Constitution vested authority to set the salaries of all state officers, including the Superintendent, in the West Virginia Legislature. The court rejected the Board's equitable argument that it was difficult to attract top-notch candidates to the Superintendent's position because the Legislature had set the salary at a substantially lower level than salaries paid to many county superintendents. The Legislature's having delegated to the Board the power to set the Superintendent's salary from 1958-1989 was not a permanent abdication of legislative authority to set salaries for state officials.</SPAN></P>

Respondents asserted that petitioners had no vested rights and that the amendments were reasonable because they guaranteed the future solvency of the public safety pension fund. Finding that petitioners clearly had property rights that could not be withdrawn because they were all state employees who had contributed into the fund and substantially relied to their detriment in investing more than half of their working lives with the state, the court held that legitimate expectations of government servants could not be confounded after those servants had partially performed their part of the bargain with the people, relied to their detriment, and foreclosed other career options. In short, the court held that the legislature simply could not alter the pension rights of state employees who had invested a substantial part of their working lives with the state. However, only W.

However, the court held that such revenue bonds would violate W. Va. Const. art.

As a result of the court's finding that the funding mechanism for repayment of the park revenue bonds violated the West Virginia Constitution, there was no duty on the secretary's part to act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All the litigants elected to participate in the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS).

One of the benefits accorded the litigants, because of their participation in PERS, was that the litigants' employees were eligible to elect PEIA coverage upon their retirement pursuant to the West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Act (Act), W. Va. Code 5-16-1 et seq. Thus, employers who elected to participate in PEIA were having to bear the cost of medical coverage for the retired employees of the litigants who elected PEIA as well as their own. The director requested the court issue a writ of mandamus compelling the litigants to make the contribution required under W. Va. Code &sect; 5-16-22 (1992) because it was the litigants' participation in PERS which made their retired employee eligible for PEIA benefits. The court issued the writ, holding that: (1) the statutes governing PERS should be read in pari materia with the PEIA statutes; (2) &sect; 5-16-22 did not violated the equal protection clause; and (3) &sect; 5-16-22 was not preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1001 et seq.</SPAN></P>

In an effort to amicably conclude the matter, the parties decided that the judge would interview any deputy sheriff that applied, but could hire from the civilian population. Shortly thereafter, the chairperson of the county wage and hour review board denied the judge's request for a civilian bailiff because he believed statutory law and W. Va. Trial Ct. R. VII required denial of the request. The judge petitioned the court for a writ of mandamus requiring respondents to provide him with a qualified bailiff of the judge's choice. The court granted the judge's petition for writ of mandamus, finding the efficient administration of the judicial system was essential to its duty to implement justice. The court held that under the provisions of W. Va. Code &sect; 51-3-5 and Rule VII, the sheriff of a county was charged with the duty of providing bailiffs. Notwithstanding, the court found a substantial, genuine, and irreconcilable conflict which required the court to assert its ultimate responsibility and authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teacher argued that he had been underpaid based on the failure of the county board of education to include the State equity supplement in the calculation of his pay. The issue was whether State equity pay had to be included in the daily rate of pay of substitute teachers who did not teach more than 10 consecutive days in the same position. While the existence of conflicting opinions from two State superintendents raised a question of the precedential value to be accorded the opinions, the court gave great weight to the interpretation of the current superintendent because it was not clearly erroneous. The court concluded that the term &quot;basic salaries&quot; as defined in W. Va. Code &sect; 18A-4-1 only referred to the corresponding amount of salary appearing in the minimum salary schedule amounts within W. Va. Code &sect; 18A-4-2 and did not encompass any additional amounts, such as equity supplements.

Her parents filed this action asserting a claim on her behalf, together with their own derivative claims, over 20 years after the daughter's birth. The trial court granted summary judgment to the physicians, the medical partnership, and the hospital because the claims were not brought within the 20-year limitations period set forth in W. Va.

The court affirmed the order granting summary judgment and held that &sect; 55-2-15 was constitutional. The court further held that in order for a permanently incompetent person to maintain a viable and timely action under &sect; 55-2-15, the lawsuit had to be brought within 20 years of the date of the wrongful act and the injury. Furthermore, the 20-year cap was reasonably related to the legislative goal of preventing stale law suits, and the failure to impose a similar cap on competent persons did not adversely discriminate against the mentally disabled.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the circuit court's decision that defendant's statements were spontaneous and not the result of an interrogation was not &quot;plainly wrong or clearly against the weight of the evidence.&quot; The court determined that evidence of defendant's prior convictions was a necessary element of the crime charged so the evidence was admissible for jury purposes. The court overruled State v. Armstrong, 175 W.

The court held 1) a change of venue was not needed because the jurors only indicated mere knowledge of the case, but stated that they could judge impartially the defendant's guilt or innocence, 2) individual voir dire was not necessary where defense counsel failed to renew his request to conduct individual voir dire after learning all the jurors were familiar with the case, 3) the gruesome photograph rule of State v.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judge was publicly censured for discussing a pending case on television. On the day following his censure, the judge appeared on a local radio station and discussed his own disciplinary proceeding, criticized a member of his investigative panel, and stated his intention to take some reactive measure. The Judicial Investigation Commission determined that probable cause existed to file a complaint against the judge based upon alleged violations of W. Va. Judicial Code of Ethics Canons 1, 2A, 3A(6). The Special Judicial Hearing Board however, determined that the evidence was insufficient to support the complaint. The court held that, consistent with U.S. Const. amend. I and W. Va. art. III, &sect; 7, the general prohibitions in Canons 1, 2, 3 could not be used to punish judges for their public remarks that did not concern a pending or impending matter and that did not violate the law or a specific prohibition. The court stated there was no persuasive evidence which showed the judge's comments conveyed a physical or otherwise improper threat. The judge's conduct did not rise to the level of being deceptive, illegal, or a flagrant abuse of power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Marshall County (West Virginia) allowed an individual to amend his personal injury complaint and join claims against petitioners, insurer and adjuster, for bad faith and unfair insurance practices, denied petitioner insured's motion to bifurcate claims based on the underlying claim's investigation and adjustment, and issued discovery orders and sanctions. The restaurant, insurer, and adjuster sought writs of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that amendment was proper under W. Va. R. Civ. P. 15, because an insurer could be joined as a defendant by an injured plaintiff alleging claims of bad faith and unfair insurance practices, W. Va. R. Civ. P. 18(b); however, the prejudice to the insured inherent in allowing the claims to be tried together required that proceedings and discovery on the insurance practices claims be stayed. Prejudice also required a separate trial for claims against the insured arising out of the investigation and adjustment of the underlying claim. W. Va. R. Civ. P. 42(c). The court held that the sanctions ordered by the circuit court after it found that the investigator contacted the individual without permission, in violation of W. Va. R. Prof. Conduct 4.2, 5.3, and engaged in illegal and unethical surveillance, were too broad. The court held that the circuit court abused its discretion by foreclosing cross-examination of the individual regarding activities that the investigator legally observed because even illegally obtained evidence was admissible for impeachment purposes and by barring the investigator's testimony about events that he legally and ethically observed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writs of prohibition as modified. The court held that the amendment was properly granted, stayed proceedings and discovery regarding the bad faith and unfair practices claim, ordered a bifurcated trial and prohibited discovery on claims against the insured arising out of the investigation and adjustment of the underlying claim, and held that sanctions imposed for illegal and unethical surveillance were overly broad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured party joined defendant state university's rugby club. Plaintiff signed an anticipatory release. After plaintiff was injured while playing rugby, he sought recovery of damages from defendant. The trial court held that the anticipatory release was an absolute bar to plaintiff's claim and granted summary judgment to defendant. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case. The court held that the anticipatory release violated public policy because defendant qualified as a public service and possessed a decisive bargaining advantage over plaintiff when he executed the release. By conditioning student participation in certain clubs upon execution of the anticipatory release, without demanding the same from students involved in other activities, defendant treated similarly situated persons differently. Thus, the release violated the West Virginia Constitution Equal Protection Clause and it also impermissibly interfered with plaintiff's right to a &quot;certain remedy&quot; pursuant to W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 17.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Attorney General filed a declaratory judgment against appellees, state officials, pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 55-13-1 et seq. (1993). He sought a determination of his rights and responsibilities under W. Va. Code &sect; 5A-3-13, which required that he approve state contracts as to form. He also sought a ruling as to the constitutionality of two computer contracts. He later appealed from the dismissal of his action. The court affirmed. It held that the Attorney General, acting in his official capacity, did not come within the parameters of the definition of &quot;person&quot; set forth in W. Va. Code &sect; 55-13-13 and was not entitled to bring a declaratory judgment action pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 55-13-2. Although the case was otherwise moot, the court decided the constitutional issue, which was whether certain one-year contracts with nine options to renew were constitutional. The court held that a one-year contract with multiple renewals did not violate constitutional or statutory provisions as they did not create the type of debt prohibited in W.Va. Const. Art. X, &sect; 4 or W. Va. Code &sect; 12-3-17. As such, there was no need to rebid the contract every time a renewal occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia) certified two questions as to whether a duly organized political action committee (PAC) was an affiliation of voters pursuant to West Virginia Code &sect; 3-1-8 (1994) and whether respondent, the West Virginia Secretary of State, was required by law to recognize an affiliation of voters as an independent political party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, the co-chairmen of a write-in campaign for a gubernatorial candidate, instituted a declaratory judgment action in the circuit court for determining whether the write-in campaign, in its capacity as a PAC, was a political party that fell within &sect; 3-1-8. The candidate, who was a member of a major political party, had received 7.4 percent of the votes in a general election. The circuit court certified two questions to the court: 1) whether a PAC was an affiliation of voters as that term was used in &sect; 3-1-8 and 2) whether the Secretary was required to recognize it as an independent political party. The court answered both questions in the negative. The court found that the State had a legitimate interest in overseeing the elective process to ensure that it functioned smoothly. It also noted that the candidate was taking great pains to disassociate herself from petitioners and that she had never authorized the write-in campaign to take any action on her behalf. No evidence suggested that the persons voting for the candidate wished to be affiliated with the write-in campaign's efforts. Nothing suggested that those votes intended to become members of a new party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the two certified questions in the negative, holding that a PAC did not qualify as an affiliation of voters representing any principle or organization.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a student and her parents, sought a writ of mandamus against respondents, the West Virginia State Board of Education (Board) and the West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission (SSAC), to compel the Board to exercise authority over extracurricular activities, to declare W. Va. Code &sect; 18-2-25 (1994) unconstitutional, to provide a signer for the student, and to schedule girls' basketball in the traditional winter season.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student, who had been deaf since birth, had a signer for her basic courses but was not provided a signer for her extracurricular activities. The parents asked the student's basketball coach about providing a signer but did not make that request to the director of special education for the county. The court held that, when a student had a disability requiring special assistance or services to enable participation in school-sanctioned extracurricular activities, a request for assistance or services could be made on the student's behalf to any school official familiar with the student's needs. That school official then had the responsibility to inform the county board of education's director of special education of the request so that appropriate action could be taken. Second, the scheduling of girls' basketball in the nontraditional season constituted a &quot;mere superficial equivalency&quot; to the boys' team and served no important governmental objective. Thus, it was unconstitutional as it violated the equal protection clause set forth in Article III, &sect; 10 of the West Virginia Constitution. Finally, the court held that W.Va. Code &sect; 18-2-25 (1994) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ sought by the student and her parents with regard to the signer and the girls' basketball season; however, the court denied the writ as it related to the constitutionality of W. Va. Code &sect; 18-2-25 (1994). The court directed the Board to submit to the court its plan to change the girls' basketball season to the winter and to provide the student with a signer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator clerks of the West Virginia legislature petitioned for a writ of mandamus against respondent auditor of West Virginia to issue warrants for the payment of legislators' salaries and expenses pursuant to W.Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 33 and W.Va. H. Bill 4031 (bill), and for a writ of prohibition against respondent judge to refrain from hearing a declaratory judgment action pending in the circuit court that involved the same matters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1994, the Citizens Legislative Compensation Commission submitted a resolution to the Vest Virginia Legislature to increase the legislators' compensation and expense allowances pursuant to W.Va.

The auditor of West Virginia and intervenor citizens argued that the requirements for setting legislative compensation and expense allowances under W.Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 33 were not properly followed and that contact by legislators with members of the commission violated due process. The court granted the writs of mandamus and prohibition and held that although the commission and the Legislature failed to follow the provisions of &sect; 33, which provided that a resolution to change compensation was only properly submitted to the Legislature every four years, the court refused to apply its interpretation of &sect; 33 retroactively in light of an attorney general opinion to the contrary.

On appeal of defendant's subsequent conviction on that charge, she asserted the circuit court failed to accept a proffered plea agreement, failed to reduce the charges from third offense to second offense on the grounds that some of her prior convictions were uncounseled, and failed to permit alternate sentencing in view of her health conditions and the nonviolent nature of the offense. As to the final contention, the State argued W. Va. Code &sect; 61-3A-3(c) did not permit any latitude in sentencing. The court reversed the sentence imposed because &sect; 61-3A-3(c) violated the cruel and unusual proscription of the Eighth Amendment and W. Va. Const. Art. III, &sect; 5 by imposing a disproportionate sentence to the crime committed by expressly prohibiting probation and implicitly prohibiting alternative sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the sentence imposed upon defendant and remand the case for consideration by the circuit court of the alternative sentencing requested by defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of five counts of third offense shoplifting and one count of obstructing an officer. Defendant was sentenced to terms of 1 to 10 years and was ordered to pay fines. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found that an out-of-court-identification of defendant was properly admitted even though the witness was shown an off-centered photographic lineup where the record indicated the witnesses' out-of court and in-court identifications were not based on the off-centered photographs and there was sufficient evidence the identifications were reliable. The court held that the trial court did not error by admitting videotapes of the shoplifting incidents into evidence because there was sufficient evidence the videotapes had not been altered or changed. The court determined that a prior conviction of defendant's was appropriately used for enhancement purposes where defendant admitted to an earlier shoplifting offense and defendant failed to show that his prior conviction was unlawfully obtained. The court concluded a mandatory fine imposed against defendant under W. Va. Code &sect; 61-3A-3(d) (1981) was not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The council determined that the existing city hall and municipal building, which were over 100 years old, were obsolete and not economically repairable, and that new buildings were in the public interest. The commission secured a financing commitment and sought to issue bonds. The agreement sought by petitioners specified that the city would make monthly rental payments to the commission for use of the new buildings. This money was to be used by the commission to retire the bonds. Petitioners filed for a writ of mandamus to compel the secretary to execute the agreement, arguing that that the agreement was necessary to finance the new buildings. The secretary refused to execute the agreement until the court determined whether the agreement created an unconstitutional debt in violation of the W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 8, or in violation of W. Va. Code &sect; 11-8-26 (1963). The court granted the writ of mandamus sought by petitioners, concluding that the bonds at issue did not violate the Virginia Constitution or &sect; 11-8-26.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town revoked the landowner's building permits because he had not complied with Town of Eleanor, W.

The jury awarded damages to the landowner, but the declaratory judgment claim was never resolved. The town's motion for a new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict was denied. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded and concluded that the trial court erroneously allowed questions of law to be decided by the jury and failed to resolve the questions of law as to whether the disputed ordinance was either a building ordinance or a zoning ordinances. The court concluded that it was a building ordinance, which had been properly enacted. The original issuance of the permits to the landowner was in violation of the ordinance, and, thus, those permits were void.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Putnam County Fire Service Board instituted civil suits to collect delinquent fire service fees owed by defendant realty owners pursuant to the Putnam County Fire Service User Fee Ordinance and West Virginia Code &sect; 7-17-12 (1984). Defendants subsequently removed the cases to the Circuit Court of Putnam County and challenged the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the fifteen-day limitation period formerly established by &sect; 7-17-12 for opponents of a fire service fee ordinance to file petitions in protest of the ordinance in order to obtain ballot access was constitutional. The circuit court certified a question as to the constitutionality of the ordinance and answered it in the affirmative, finding the ordinance unconstitutional. Plaintiff sought review. Plaintiff argued that the fifteen-day limitation period mandated by West Virginia Code &sect; 7-17-12 was clear, unambiguous, imperative and constitutional. Plaintiff also maintained that the circuit court's ruling that the limitation period was unduly restrictive was arbitrary, capricious and plainly wrong. Defendants contended that the limitation period burdened the right of individuals to associate and to have access to the ballot box. The court found that &sect; 7-17-12 was deliberately designed to make the initiation of a fire service fee ordinance comparatively simple, while at the same time making it difficult for taxpayers to call for a referendum. The limitation period for filing did not infringe on a fundamental right requiring a compelling state interest be shown.</SPAN></P>

VIII, &sect; 7, which specifically provided for the filling of vacancies in the office of, inter alia, circuit judge. The court held that the governor's position prevailed, because under principles of constitutional construction, just as with statutory construction, where provisions were in conflict, the provision with greater specificity prevailed over the more general provision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act recognized that a sufficient amount of real property and personal property was undervalued for tax purposes, and sought to remedy the problem by the imposition of a requirement that all taxable property be reassessed.

The Act allowed assessor to gradually implement the percentage, W. Va. Code &sect; 11-1C-7(d).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the mother gave birth to the daughter, the father extended neither emotional or financial support to the daughter during her lifetime. When the daughter was killed in an automobile accident, the mother filed a wrongful death action on her behalf, and the father, who had previously denied that he was the parent to avoid the legal obligation of paying child support and whose paternity had never been judicially determined, filed a motion to intervene. The results of testing established that he was the biological father, and the trial court granted the father's motion for summary judgment and awarded him one-half of the net proceeds of the wrongful death settlement. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the father was equitably estopped from asserting his paternity and from reaping the financial benefits from the daughter's death. Although the court found that estoppel should be applied cautiously, it concluded that this was clearly a case where it should be applied due to the father's disavowal of paternity in order to escape legal and financial responsibility during the daughter's lifetime.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 27-11-1 (1992), the commissioner made a determination of incompetency and appointed the elderly father's daughter as committee. The elderly father sought a writ of habeas corpus to dissolve the appointment, and argued that his constitutional rights to liberty and due process had been violated. The court granted the writ, and concluded that the evidence was insufficient to support the commission's determination. The elderly father had not been present at the determination hearing. The court held that commitment determination could not have been summarily made, but must have been established through clear and convincing evidence. Advanced age and past physical problems did not meet the statutory requirements for incompetency. The incompetency laws had been revised subsequent to the commission's determination, and W. Va. Code. ch. 44, the West Virginia Guardianship and Conservatorship Act, provided for more appropriate procedures. The case was remanded to the circuit court for a proper determination of the elderly father's incompetency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The basis for the HRC's assumption of jurisdiction of complaints of racial discrimination by inmates was its belief that the state's penal institutions were places of public accommodations, as defined in W. Va. Code &sect; 5-11-3(j) (1992). The HRC reasoned that under W. Va. Code &sect; 5-11-9(6)(A) (1992) racial discrimination was not permitted. The inmates, two black men imprisoned at the Huttonsville Correctional Center, alleged in the underlying complaint that the prison administration did not protect black inmates from physical violence inflicted by white inmates who belonged to a supremacist group called the Aryan Brotherhood. On appeal, the court held that the state's penal institutions were not places of public accommodations for prisoners housed therein. Therefore, the inmates' claims of discrimination were not under the jurisdiction of the HRC. However, the court pointed out that the inmates would have other relief available to them. The inmates had a right to request relief by writ of habeas corpus under the Eighth and Fourteenth amendments. The court also noted that state courts had concurrent jurisdiction to handle suits by prison inmates under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, holding that a jury instruction in a first degree murder case that informed the jury that malice need not be shown on the part of defendant against the deceased was erroneous.

The trial court also erred in refusing defendant's request to advise the jury as to the consequences of a recommendation of mercy. The court held that there was no error in refusing to permit defendant to impeach a prosecution witness with the witness's prior conviction of receiving stolen property because the crime was a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for a term not to exceed one year and was not based on facts showing deceitfulness or falsification; thus, the conviction was not admissible under W.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff military retirees' declaratory judgment action against defendant state tax commissioner, the tax commissioner appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia), which held that a West Virginia tax scheme that taxed federal military pensions while exempting certain state retirement benefits discriminated against military retirees in violation of 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the military retirees had failed to demonstrate that their job descriptions during any substantial part of their active service corresponded to the job descriptions of the exempted state employees. The court held that there was no intent in the West Virginia scheme to discriminate against federal retirees; rather, the intent was to give a benefit to a very narrow class of former state and local employees. The court specifically found that retired military personnel were treated more favorably than West Virginians who had retired from civilian occupations, that retired military personnel were treated equally with all persons retired from the West Virginia Public Employees Retirement System and the West Virginia Teachers Retirement System, and that military retirees were treated substantially more favorably than persons retired from the West Virginia Judicial Retirement System. Therefore, the court found it extraordinarily difficult to infer that any of the pernicious dynamics that either the ancient doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity or 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111 were designed to remedy was implicated in the state tax scheme.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city contracted with a company to provide waste disposal services. The contract provided that the city would buy back the company's improvements if the agreement was prematurely terminated for specified reasons. The city mayor refused to sign the agreement due to a concern that it would create an unlawful debt in violation of W. Va. Const. art. X, &sect; 8 or W. Va. Code &sect; 11-8-26 (1963). The city council sought mandamus to compel the mayor to sign the agreement. The court granted mandamus relief, holding that the agreement did not violate the constitution or statute. The contract only created an obligation that matured periodically as each installment came due. Therefore, the contract would not be illegal so long as the first year's payment could be paid from either current revenue or a special fund, and since a special fund was created for the purpose, the contract was not illegal. Neither was it illegal to enter into the buyback agreement because the city controlled when the agreement would come into being. Finally, mandamus lay against the mayor because he, as a public officer, could be compelled to perform a ministerial act such as signing the contract in question.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the case. The court held that &sect; 9-2-11 constituted a discriminatory funding scheme which violated an indigent woman's constitutional rights. The court found that because there was a federally-created right of privacy that the court was required to enforce in a non-discriminatory manner, it was inconsequential that no prior decision of the court expressly determined the existence of an analogous right. The court held that when the state government sought to act for the common benefit, protection, and security of the people in providing medical care for the poor, it had an obligation to do so in a neutral manner so as not to infringe upon the constitutional rights of its citizens. The court found that the provisions of &sect; 9-2-11 constituted undue government interference with the exercise of the federally-protected right to terminate a pregnancy.</SPAN></P>

Va. Code, 24-3-1 (1923) for failing to provide safe water to customers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water company was a private corporation, regulated by the Public Service Commission. The warrants brought against defendant by customers of the water company charged that defendant failed to establish and maintain adequate and suitable facilities for customers, in violation of Chapter 24-3-1 of the West Virginia Code. The water company was put into involuntary receivership. Defendant stated that he was financially unable to fix the problem since the banks would not lend him the money and the Public Service Commission had put on hold his request for a rate increase. The witnesses all stated that the water was not safe to drink. An engineer stated that the only way to take care of the problem would be to put a new system in which would cost two to three million dollars. The court addressed defendant's contention that his convictions under W. Va. Code, 24-3-1 (1923) should be reversed on the ground that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court agreed. It found that the statute did not provide any standard by which a jury could determine what was safe and adequate water service and the jury's subjective knowledge of ordinary commercial knowledge would vary.</SPAN></P>

The court found that no special fund was created except that which already existed in the general revenue fund. The court concluded, therefore, that that the bonds that were to be liquidated by dedicating a portion of the existing consumer sales tax, which was a general revenue fund tax, created new debt and violated art.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a sixth grade teacher, was convicted of engaging in oral and vaginal intercourse with one of her students on several occasions. After defendant admitted to a friend that she was sexually involved with a student, the friend contacted a child abuse hotline employee who, in turn, contacted the appropriate prosecuting attorney's office. The student detailed to law enforcement authorities the approximate dates, times, and locations of his sexual encounters with defendant. After signing a form acknowledging and choosing to give up her Miranda rights, defendant gave a statement describing her sexual encounters with the student. Defendant was placed under arrest. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred by failing to suppress her statement, by denying her motions for judgment of acquittal or for a new trial, by failing to dismiss counts charging her with performing acts of oral sex on the student, by failing to admit certain testimony concerning the student's prior sexual conduct, and by imposing an unconstitutionally harsh sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party was 15 when she was severely injured by falling bleachers at her school. The injured party did not bring an action against the education board for over three years after the incident. The trial court determined that the injured party's action was time barred, pursuant to &sect; 29-12A-6(b), but the court reversed and remanded the case. The court determined that &sect; 29-12A-6(b) violated the Equal Protection Clause found in W. Va. Const. art.

The court found that the classification was not rational based on social, economic, historic, or geographic factors. Further, the classification did not bear a reasonable relationship to the alleged governmental purpose of obtaining reasonable insurance rates.

The court held that &sect; 5-3-3 indicated the legislature's intent to give the attorney general unfettered control over the hiring and firing of his assistants. Even if the statute did not contain the aforementioned phrase, the employment would still have been at-will because at-will removal power was implied when the employer had the power of appointment and the office carried no fixed term.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lottery commission and track owner filed a writ of mandamus against the state officials arising out of a contract for the operation of video lottery machines by the track owner under the State Lottery Act. The machines were owned by a third party. The state officials' argued that the state had to own the terminals pursuant to W. Va. Const. art VI, &sect; 36. The court held that art. VI, &sect; 36 was clear and unambiguous, and it authorized the legislature to establish a state-run lottery and to prescribe laws for the regulation, control, ownership, and operation of the lotteries. However, the legislature failed to define what an electronic video lottery was or to authorize it. It was also unclear whether an electronic video lottery fell within the definition of a lottery in the State Lottery Act or art. VI, &sect; 36 or whether it was the type of gambling prohibited in the state anti-gambling statutes. When the lottery commission expanded the lottery into video lottery machines it was acting without constitutional or statutory authority because such authority had not been delegated to it by the legislature. The court held that plaintiffs were clearly not entitled to the relief sought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the commission and track owner's petition for a writ of mandamus to compel approval of a contract amendment and contract agreement by the state officials.</SPAN></P>

Va. House Bill 2120 declared unconstitutional on the ground that it contained more than one subject, neither of which was related to the other.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Bill contained three amendments to the West Virginia Code. One of the amendments was to West Virginia Code &sect; 6-7-2a, which provided for the appointment, qualifications, and salaries of numerous state officers. It was amended to increase the salary of the West Virginia Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles. The administrators were not being compensated pursuant to that statute, but their salaries were set forth at higher amounts in portions of the Code that addressed their powers and duties. Before &sect; 6-7-2a was enacted, the administrators received salaries higher than those set by &sect; 6-7-2a. The effect of the amendments on &sect; 6-7-2a was to reduce their salaries. The court held that W. Va. Const. art VI, &sect; 30 provided that no act could embrace more than one object and that was to be expressed in the title. The State Auditor and the Treasurer admitted that the Bill violated the &quot;one subject&quot; rule and requested that the court nullify the part that decreased the administrators' salaries. The court held that where the title included two subjects of legislation, the whole act fell because it was improper for the court to choose between the two.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and stated that a police officer could effect a warrantless arrest for the serious misdemeanor of driving under the influence by following the misdemeanant into his own home in hot pursuit, without a warrant. The court held that under the doctrine of qualified immunity, a police officer was absolved from civil liability for following a misdemeanant in hot pursuit into the residence of a third party, with neither a warrant nor the permission of the third party, in order to effect a warrantless arrest of the misdemeanant, so long as such entry violated no clearly established statutory or constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court conducted a proper in camera hearing and gave an extensive cautionary instruction to the jury that limited its consideration of defendant's collateral acts and crimes, including the drug investigation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an earlier case, a wholesale gross receipts tax that was imposed against the oil company was declared unconstitutional. It was also determined that the decision invalidating the tax had to be applied retroactively. In accord with a State administrative notice, the tax department scheduled a hearing on the oil company's refund claim. Instead of proceeding with the hearing, the oil company sought a writ of mandamus from the circuit court. The circuit changed the case to a declaratory judgment action on the issue of whether the administrative notice was enforceable. On appeal, the court granted the State's request for a writ of prohibition preventing the declaratory judgment action. The court found that W. Va. Code &sect; 11-10-14 (1978) and W. Va. Code &sect; 11-10-14b (1992) provided judicial review of tax refund matters only after the tax department made its ruling on the refund. Furthermore, W. Va. Code &sect; 11-10-14(1) (1978) explicitly prohibited declaratory judgments in refund cases.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a class action, defendants, sheriff, chief correctional officer, and county commissioners, challenged a preliminary injunction from the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, which was granted in favor of plaintiff inmates, who contended that confinement conditions were unconstitutional. The district court certified a question to the court regarding the omnibus bill that included jail standards.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing a class action involving plaintiff inmates and defendants, sheriff, chief correctional officer, and county commissioners, the court considered a certified question examining whether an omnibus bill authorizing the rules of many different agencies including the Minimum Jail Standards, 1988 W. Va. Acts 64-2-31(20)(9), violated the one-subject rule. The court held that it did. The court found that legislators did not have the actual rule before them when voting on the omnibus bill. The court held that if there was a reasonable basis for the grouping of various matters in a legislative bill, and if the grouping did not lead to logrolling or other deceiving tactics, then the one-object rule in W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 30 was not violated, but the use of an omnibus bill could lead to those problems. The court reformulated the certified question to explore whether its holding that an omnibus bill was unconstitutional should be applied prospectively and asserted that because its interpretation was not foreshadowed, prospective application was favored, as retroactivity would invalidate hundreds of rules and create too great a burden. The certified question was deemed answered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified question, holding that the omnibus bill was unconstitutional in violating the one-object rule. Recognizing the potential burden on the legislature, the court made its holding prospective and not retroactive. The case was remanded for further proceedings on the issues remaining between plaintiff inmates and defendants, sheriff, chief correctional officer, and county commissioners, consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city amended its zoning ordinance. The voters circulated a petition requesting reconsideration of the amendment. They obtained enough signatures to satisfy the requirements of the city's charter.

They maintained that the city was required to either repeal the amended ordinance or to hold a referendum on the matter. The court denied the voters' petition. Morgantown W. Va., City Charter &sect; 8.01(b) required a referendum when the city council refused to repeal an ordinance in response to a petition. The court noted that the Zoning Enabling Act, specifically W. Va. Code &sect; 8-24-23 (1969), did not authorize a public referendum on an amendment to a zoning ordinance. Furthermore, &sect; 8-24-23, which was enacted after W. Va. Code &sect; 8-12-4 (1969), superceded the referendum powers granted to home rule cities by &sect; 8-12-4 with regard to amending zoning ordinances. Therefore, the amendment was not subject to a referendum and Morgantown W. Va., City Charter &sect; 8.01(b) was inconsistent with W. Va.

Defendant argued that both sentences arose from the same transaction and that they constituted unconstitutional double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A young woman walking at night noticed a car following her at a slow rate of speed. Shortly after, she saw that a man was following her on foot. He grabbed her, put his hand up her skirt, and grabbed her breasts through her shirt. He fell on top of her and roughly fondled her breasts. Defendant argued that his two convictions were improper for one offense and violated the Double Jeopardy clause of both the state and federal constitutions. On appeal, the court noted that simply because two criminal statutes were construed to proscribe the same conduct did not mean that the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded the imposition of cumulative punishments pursuant to those statutes. The first step in the double jeopardy analysis was to determine whether the legislature intended that each violation be a separate offense. The term &quot;sexual contact&quot; defined in W. Va. Code &sect; 61-8B-1(6) identified different acts that constituted sexual contact. Each act required proof of a fact that the other did not. The court held that defendant, who committed two separate acts of sexual contact on his victim, was convicted of each act without violating double jeopardy principles.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that W. Va. Code &sect; 11-10-14(i) (1978) made that the exclusive remedy for procuring a tax refund. The court noted that a declaratory judgment action was inappropriate because such an action would be intervention in the tax refund case not allowed by statute. The court concluded that an administrative notice put out by the tax department was not a regulation within the contemplation of the Administrative Procedure Act, W. Va. Code ch. 29A.  The court determined that the burden of proof had to rest on the State to show by clear and convincing evidence the amount of tax passed on to consumers that did not affect the corporation's market performance if the State intended to reduce the refund by some amount based on the pass-on theory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court enjoined the Department from building a 150 bed mental health facility in a case that arose out of an earlier decision in which the court held that the State must comply with the provisions of W.

Revenue bonds were issued and site preparation had started when the advocates filed a motion to enjoin the construction on the ground that there were better ways to spend the money. The trial court stayed its order pending appeal. The court reversed because the trial court and the advocates had no authority to challenge the project. The court noted that under the principle of separation of powers found in W. Va. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 the legislature and not the courts had the responsibility for economic decisions. The court noted that there was no constitutional objection to the project and that the advocates had impermissibly asserted a different position in the case.

The court held that even under the statute, the trial court was required to consider the circumstances of the latest and earlier offenses, with particular consideration as to whether they were violent crimes or only property crimes. The court held that defendant's crimes, while felonies, were not violent, involved only crimes against property, and that defendant evidenced no tendency toward violence.

The court concluded that the former employee's transfer to the position of Area Maintenance Manager was an unconstitutional infringement on his First Amendment rights of belief and association that did not outweigh the articulation of any benefit the department might have claimed to receive by having superintendents whose political affiliation comported with that of the governor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment declaring the statute unconstitutional as it applied to the former superintendent and affirmed the judgment ordering that he be reinstated to his position as Wayne County Maintenance Superintendent.</SPAN></P>

He also represented the client on appeal. The attorney filed a voucher for the trial, which was paid, and for the appeal, which was reduced by the trial court. The attorney sought a writ of mandamus to force the trial court to approve the appellate fee voucher in its entirety. He argued that although the voucher was in excess of the amount permitted under W. Va. Code 29-21-13(a) (1990), it should have been approved because the client's four convictions should have been considered separate actions. The court noted that approval of the fee was within the trial court's discretion. The court ruled that single appeals, regardless of the number of convictions, constituted a single proceeding. The court further held that the trial court's reduction of the attorney's appellate fee to an amount less than the maximum for an appeal was not an abuse of discretion. In the future, the court advised the trial court to provide a brief explanation for reducing the fee amount claimed by court-appointed counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">To support their claim that the town was attempting to selectively enforce the tax laws against them, the corporations successfully filed a motion for production and inspection, seeking disclosure of information relating to business and occupational tax returns that had been filed with the town. Information about the filing taxpayers was also sought. The town filed the petition after the judge granted the discovery motion. The court issued the requested writ, holding that W. Va. Code &sect; 11-10-5d(a) (1987) was enacted to preserve taxpayer privacy and preserved the confidentiality of the contents of all tax returns, including business and occupation tax returns. The Equal Protection Clause, however, required the town to tax the corporations similarly to other taxpayers in their tax classification. In order to prove that they were being taxed at a different rate, or that the town had not taxed similarly situated businesses at all, the corporations needed some access to the town's tax returns.

The father argued that the name change was required in order to protect the minor from the stigma of illegitimacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the minor was born out of wedlock, the mother and father married, but later divorced. Thereafter, the mother gained custody, and the minor, in accordance with the birth certificate, retained the mother's last name. During a subsequent hearing, the father requested the minor's last name be changed to the father's. The request was granted. Accordingly, review was sought, and the court reversed. The court rejected the contention that a name change would protect against illegitimacy's stigma because: (1) there was no longer a legal stigma surrounding illegitimacy, (2) the marriage had legitimized the minor under W. Va. Code &sect; 42-1-6, and (3) the divorce had not affected the legitimacy under W. Va. Code &sect; 42-1-7. The court also held the trial court had failed to follow the procedures for a name change pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 48-5-1 et seq. (1992). Moreover, the court held that because the name change involved a minor, proof that the change was in the minor's best interests was necessary over and above what W. Va. Code &sect; 48-5-1 et seq. required. Finally, the court noted that the father had failed to change the minor's name at birth, pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 16-5-24(d) (1992).</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 29-12A-5(a)(11) conferred immunity from suit upon political subdivisions in the state in personal injury cases where the claim or loss resulted from a claim covered by workers' compensation or employer's liability laws.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The plaintiffs suffered personal injuries that occurred during their course of employment.

The trial courts in two of the cases granted summary judgment for the political subdivisions. The third trial court certified certain questions relating to W. Va. Code &sect; 29-12A-5(a)(11). On appeal, the court consolidated the three cases because they presented similar issues regarding the West Virginia Governmental Tort Claims and Insurance Reform Act, W. Va. Code &sect; 29-12A-1 et seq. The court determined W. Va. Code &sect; 29-12A-5(a) was designed to make liability insurance more affordable to political subdivisions by reducing the number of tort cases filed against them. The court held &sect; 29-12A-5(a)(11) did not violate the equal protection principles of the state's constitution. The court ruled &sect; 29-12A-5(a)(11) provided immunity to a political subdivision for all damages arising from a tortious injury, not merely for those compensated by workers' compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate filed suit to obtain a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that he was unlawfully confined in a regional jail and that he had effectively been denied parole. Respondents, the parole board, the division of corrections, and other public officials, answered the writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading guilty to uttering, the inmate was sentenced to a term of one to 10 years in a state prison facility. He served about 13 months in a regional jail before he was transferred to a state facility, as a result of filing suit. Though the parole board scheduled the inmate for parole consideration on a certain date, the scheduling did not occur until after he was transferred. In granting the writ, the court held that under W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 25-1-15, 62-13-5, the division of corrections had a nondiscretionary duty to incarcerate inmates sentenced to prison to a state penal facility operated by the division. The division was prohibited from lodging inmates in a regional facility, absent the availability of space, once the inmates were sentenced to a division of corrections facility. Moreover, the parole board had a mandatory duty to consider an inmate for parole once he was eligible and to conduct a parole hearing, if necessary, in any facility where the inmate was being lodged, whether it was one within the division of corrections or a regional jail. Thus, the parole board violated W. Va. Code &sect; 62-12-13 by refusing to consider the inmate for parole until after his transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the writ and directed the division to comply with Dodrill by developing a plan within the next six months to provide a temporary arrangement to meet its obligation to house and detain all those lawfully sentenced to a state penal facility until the new prison was completed. The court also directed the parole board to conduct appropriate hearings for inmates eligible for parole.</SPAN></P>

When the sheriff took office, he replaced them with &quot;his own people.&quot; The former employees filed a complaint against the sheriff, alleging that he fired them in violation of their constitutional rights. The trial court dismissed the complaint based on its interpretation of W. Va. Code &sect; 7-7-7 (1982), which stated that sheriffs could &quot;appoint and employ, to assist them in the discharge of their official duties for and during their respective terms of office, assistants, deputies and employees.&quot; On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that dismissals of non-civil service protected employees were improper and violative of First Amendment rights when made for political patronage reasons. The court noted that even if the legislature had intended to codify patronage dismissals by enacting &sect; 7-7-7, such codification inherently violated the former employees' freedom to associate pursuant to both the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 7. The court thus interpreted the statute as not allowing the sheriff to make employment decisions based solely upon political reasons.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that: (1) the crime of embezzlement by a public official, as that offense was set forth in W. Va. Code &sect; 61-3-20, was not a specific intent crime; (2) while proof of intent to steal or misappropriate was not required, proof that the public official intended to do the act or acts that resulted in the embezzlement was necessary to convict a public official of embezzlement pursuant to the second paragraph of W.

Va. Code &sect; 62-1C-17b(a) (1989). Defendant argued the circuit court erred by admitting evidence regarding the revocation of his personal recognizance bond. He also claimed &sect; 62-1C-17b(a) did not apply because after his bond was revoked, he was not released upon his personal recognizance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with burglary and larceny. After a mistrial was declared, he was placed on a personal recognizance bond pending trial and was directed to make weekly contacts with his probation officer and attend all court appearances. Defendant was notified that trial was scheduled for a certain date. Less than a month later, the probation officer informed the prosecutor that defendant failed to appear for two consecutive weeks. The circuit court then allowed the State's motion to revoke bond. After defendant failed to appear on the date scheduled for trial, he was indicted under &sect; 62-1C-17b. On appeal, the court held that there was no merit to defendant's assertion that the circuit court erred by admitting testimony regarding his bond revocation on the ground that it was irrelevant. Defendant did not object to the testimony and in fact had introduced it himself through cross-examination of two state witnesses. Section 62-1C-17b applied to persons who, after having been released on personal recognizance, failed to appear. The intervening event of bond revocation did not render the statute inapplicable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Greenbrier County (West Virginia) certified questions arising out of a first-degree murder case, which resulted in a mistrial. The certification was made pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 58-5-2 and W. Va. R. App. P. 13. The court granted the case to determine whether the state could obtain review of a ruling made in a criminal case by certified question under W. Va. Code &sect; 58-5-2 (1967) or by writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first certified question asked whether the trial court properly admitted against defendant the confession of an alleged co-defendant who did not testify at trial. The second certified question asked: If the confession was improperly admitted, was a retrial of defendant barred by double jeopardy? The court dismissed the case as improvidently awarded and held that W. Va. Code &sect; 58-5-2 was for certifying questions in civil cases. The state's right to appeal in a criminal case was contained in W. Va. Code &sect; 58-5-30 and confined to those cases where a circuit court held an indictment bad or insufficient. The state was, however, entitled to a limited right to seek a writ of prohibition in a criminal case where the trial court acted outside of its jurisdiction. The state would have to demonstrate that the trial court's action was so flagrant that it was deprived of its right to prosecute the case or deprived of a valid conviction, and the prohibition proceeding could offend neither the Double Jeopardy Clause nor defendant's right to a speedy trial. Even if the issue were before the court in prohibition, however, the lack of a factual record foreclosed consideration of it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction arose from an incident, in which he held a repairman at gunpoint because the repairman was unable to fix defendant's stove. After the jury verdict, the State filed a habitual offender information, citing four prior convictions for crimes committed under a different name. These separate crimes included convictions for possession of a firearm by a felon, grand larceny, and burglary. The jury found that defendant was the person who was convicted of the prior crimes and sentenced him to life imprisonment as a habitual offender. Defendant argued that a conviction that occurred 15 years earlier was too remote in time to serve as the basis for the recidivist sentence. The court held that the deterrent purpose of W.Va. Code &sect; 61-11-18 was not served if earlier felony convictions were excluded because of their ages. The court further held that that under W.Va. Code &sect; 61-11-18, the State was not required to utilize its five-year enhancement proceeding before a life recidivist proceeding was invoked. Additionally, the court held that the imposition of the life recidivist sentence did not violate the proportionality doctrine under W.Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 5.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of Berkeley County (West Virginia) ruled that the county ordinance that imposed such sanctions was unconstitutional. The county officials appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The building code enforcement officer issued notices of building code violations to the corporation, and its principals, posted a stop-work notice, and filed criminal complaints that charged them with continuing to operate their business without required permits, and the principals and several employees were arrested. The principals filed a petition for a writ of prohibition that sought to prevent the officer and magistrates from obtaining, issuing, or enforcing warrants against them for alleged violations of the county building code. The circuit court determined that the county ordinance adopting the building code was unconstitutional insofar as it permitted imposition of penalties. On appeal, the court reversed the circuit court because, although there was no direct statutory authorization for the county to impose penalties, a grant of the police power to a local government necessarily included the right to carry it into effect and empowered the governing body to use proper means to enforce its ordinances. The power to punish by a pecuniary fine or penalty was implied from the delegation by the legislature of the right to enforce a particular police power.</SPAN></P>

Code, 618B-7 and for two other concurrent terms of from one-to-five years for two additional convictions of first-degree sexual abuse.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a minister who operated a private school in the basement of his home. A 14-year-old student accused defendant of four separate sexual assaults during the 1985-86 school year. The circuit court instructed the jury to consider whether the sexual assault resulted from &quot;forcible compulsion&quot; in accord with W.Va. Code, 61-8B-1(c) (effective July 1, 1986), which augmented the W.Va. Code, 61-8B-1(1)(a)-(b) definitions of such compulsion to include fear by a child under 16 years of age caused by intimidation, expressed or implied, by another person 4 years older than the victim. Because the effective date of 61-8B-1(c) was after the dates of the charged crimes, the court on appeal held that defendant was entitled to a new trial because his convictions violated prohibitions against ex post facto laws set forth in Article I, &sect; 10, clause 1 of the United States Constitution and West Virginia Constitution, Article III, &sect; 4. The court reasoned that W.Va. Code, 61-8B-1(c) was an ex post facto law that impermissibly altered the legal rules of evidence, and received less or different testimony than the law required at the commission of the offense, in order to convict defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DNR sought a declaration that the corporations were operating a landfill without a certificate of site approval in violation of W. Va. Code &sect; 20-9-12b. The DNR sought a preliminary injunction. The trial court denied the DNR's attempt to enforce W. Va. Code &sect; 20-9-12b and W. Va. Code &sect; 20-9-12c against the corporations. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the trial court committed error by applying the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel to the questions before it. The federal district court did not rule on the merit of the action at hand, which was whether the corporations were entitled to a permit under the law. Rather, the federal district court merely determined which law applied, namely the law in effect on February 3, 1988. Because the issue of the requirement of a certificate of site approval from county or regional solid waste authorities was not litigated in the federal district court, it was error for the trial court to apply principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel to bar litigation seeking to adjudicate the issue in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of Kanawha County (West Virginia) entered a judgment for the plaintiffs, an infant and his parents, and, holding that the $ 1Million &quot;cap&quot; on noneconomic loss in a medical liability action against the defendant doctor, as set forth in the West Virginia Medical Professional Liability Act of 1986, W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 55-7B-1 to 55-7B-11(1986) was unconstitutional, awarded $ 4.5 Million in noneconomic damages. The doctor appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A doctor contended that the &quot;cap&quot; on noneconomic loss was constitutional. The parents of the injured infant argued that it violated the equal protection, special legislation, due process, &quot;certain remedy,&quot; and jury trial provisions of the West Virginia Constitution. The court held: (1) W. Va. Code &sect; 55-7B-8, as amended, which provided a $ 1 Million limit or &quot;cap&quot; on the amount recoverable for a noneconomic loss in a medical professional liability action was constitutional; and (2) the &quot;cap&quot; applied as one overall limit to the aggregated claims of all plaintiffs against a health care provider, rather than applying to each plaintiff separately. The test for &quot;certain remedy&quot; purposes required the existence of a clear social or economic problem, and that the legislative alteration of a common-law right or remedy must be a reasonable method of eliminating or curtailing it. Because the right to file a lawsuit for tort damages was not a fundamental right, the &quot;rational basis&quot; test for state constitutional equal protection purposes was applicable to statutory limitation on remedies in certain common-law causes of action, such as statutory &quot;caps&quot; on the recoverable amount of damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment entered in favor of the injured infant and his parents, but reversed the award of noneconomic damages, and adjusted the noneconomic damages in conformity with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

The commissioner, who was named as a defendant in a declaratory judgment action in the Circuit Court of Mingo County (West Virginia), contended that venue was improper in Mingo County and sought a writ of prohibition against respondent circuit judge, prohibiting further proceedings in the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, judge and bank, conceded that the commissioner was a state agent, but they contended that for the remaining defendants, corporations and private individuals, venue was proper in Mingo County and that once venue was proper for one defendant, it was proper for all other defendants subject to process. What respondents failed to recognize was that the principle did not usually apply when one of the defendants was the governor, any other state officer, or a state agency pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 14-2-2(a)(1). Respondents contended that an exception to W. Va. Code &sect; 14-2-2 was carved out because the recovery sought was from private sources rather than public funds. However, that exception was recognized because it did not defeat the manifest purpose of &sect; 14-2-2. The real party in interest in the case was a state officer. The purpose of &sect; 14-2-2 could easily be defeated if every time a state officer were sued, a private citizen or corporation was also sued. The court declined to sanction such a result. The court found that the order dismissing the commissioner's motion exceeded the trial court's lawful jurisdiction, and it issued a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a writ prohibiting the judge from acting further in the declaratory judgment action by a bank against the commissioner, the corporations, and private individuals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Circuit Court of Brooke County (West Virginia) denied their motion to suppress certain evidence, petitioner employees filed a petition for a writ of prohibition against respondents, judge and prosecutor, to prevent further criminal proceedings against them. The employees argued that the evidence was obtained by a nonresident private investigator in violation of W. Va. Code &sect; 61-6-11 (1923).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were charged with delivery of marijuana, a controlled substance, after their employer hired an out-of-state investigator. The employees' motion to suppress the investigator's evidence was denied by the trial court and in an original proceeding in the court, they sought a writ of prohibition on the ground that the evidence was obtained in violation of &sect; 61-6-11. The court denied the writ and dismissed the rule to show cause, concluding that &sect; 61-6-11 discriminated against nonresident investigators. No law prevented the use of resident investigators. In addition, the ability to pursue employment in another state was a fundamental right which was protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, cl. 1. The reason for &sect; 61-6-11, a nonresident's presumed unfamiliarity with state laws, did not satisfy the substantiality test so as to justify excluding nonresident investigators from employment. Section 61-6-11 violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause insofar as it applied to nonresident private investigators, and it did not provide a basis for excluding evidence gathered by any nonresident investigators pursuing their livelihood in the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The policeman began working for the department in 1968. He enlisted in the National Guard while working for the department. His service in the Guard included weekend drills, annual summer camp, and various other duty assignments. He was never called to active duty. In 1990, the policeman applied for a pension pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect;&sect; 8-22-25 and 8-22-7 (1985), asserting that his service in the Guard, in total, amounted to more than the one year required service. The board denied the application for benefits, holding that his employment had not been &quot;interrupted&quot; by Guard service. The policeman appealed to the trial court, which ordered the pension board to reconvene and reconsider the application based on the statutes in effect in 1968 on his date of hire. The board again denied benefits. The trial court reversed upon the policeman's appeal. The board sought review. The court held that the statute in place at the time the policeman's interest in his pension became vested controlled his receipt of benefits. The year of service required for eligibility for early pension was a consecutive year; the policeman's intermittent Guard service did not qualify.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the petitioners had failed to show their entitlement to the requested mandamus relief. The court denied the writ, holding that the 1990 amendment to &sect; 5-10-28 did not constitute an unconstitutional impairment of the contractual rights of the former public employer division's beneficiaries or retirees for the system had always owned all of the assets.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court found that because the bill clearly enunciated its purpose as a supplementary appropriations bill, it did not violate &sect; 30. However, the court held that the legislature could not amend or violate substantive statutes by passage of a supplemental appropriation bill that required money to be spent and expropriated in a manner contrary to that already provided by statute. Thus, the bill violated West Virginia Code &sect; 12-2-2(j). The court found that the circuit court erred in refusing to recognize the &quot;historical method analysis&quot; as a means of projecting the existence of surplus in a special revenue account and in finding the bill unconstitutional on that basis. There was no prohibition on the use of historical averaging for determining the existence of a surplus when a supplemental appropriation was sought before the end of the fiscal year.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, estate of decedent and injured victims, appealed from the Circuit Court of Marion County, West Virginia, which dismissed the action against defendants, city, police department and employees, for failure to state a claim in light of the West Virginia Governmental Tort Claims and Insurance Reform Act of 1986 (the Act), W. Va. Code &sect; 29-12A-5(a)(5) (1986) and W. Va. Code &sect; 29-12A-5(b) (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent repeatedly requested police protection against a man that was harassing and threatening her. The police took no action, despite that he had seriously injured her and had an outstanding arrest warrant. She was driving when she saw the man following her. She parked directly beside the police station and blew her horn in an unsuccessful attempt at police help. The man shot her and injured a passenger. The court affirmed the circuit court's finding that the qualified tort immunity provisions of the West Virginia Governmental Tort Claims Act were constitutional. The dispositive procedural issue, however, was the propriety of the dismissal. The court found the dismissal was improper due to a material factual issue raised by the complaint of whether a special relationship existed between plaintiffs and defendants. Lacking a clear expression to the contrary, the court found that the Act incorporated the common-law special duty rule and did not immunize a breach of a special duty to provide, or the method of providing, such protection to a particular individual. If proved, such a relationship created duties not covered by the immunity provisions of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision that the qualified tort immunity provisions of the governmental tort claim act was constitutional. On the other hand, the court reversed the circuit court's dismissal for failure to state a claim because the decedent's estate and the injured passengers raised a factual issue of whether they had a special relationship with the city. Therefore, the court remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The lower court denied his motion and held that the Act was unconstitutional and the court reversed. The court found that the Act did not extinguish causes of action against governmental agencies, but merely removed individuals as defendants. The court concluded that the Act was reasonable for the purpose in which it was enacted, to limit liability insurance costs for political subdivisions. The court held that the Act's provisions, which provided immunity for an employee of a political subdivision under some circumstances, did not violate the certain remedy provision of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect;17, nor did it violate the equal protection principles contained in the W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10. The court held that &sect;29-12A-16(d) of the Act, which provided that the purchase of liability insurance did not constitute a waiver of any immunity or defense of the political subdivision or its employees did not violate equal protection principles because it was rationally related to the legitimate government purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the budget bill for 1992 was passed by the West Virginia legislature, the chairmen of the conferees committee on the budget met and prepared a digest of the budget bill, as required by &sect; 4-1-18. Claiming that this process violated an open meetings law and that the budget digest improperly differed from the actual budget bill that passed the legislature, the activists petitioned for mandamus relief. In granting relief in part, the supreme court ruled that, although a budget digest did not have the force and effect of law and &sect; 4-1-18 was therefore not facially a violation of the constitutional separation of powers doctrine, to prevent the statute from being unconstitutional in its application, digests were required to include a disclaimer that they did not have the force and effect of law. Moreover, it was a violation of &sect; 4-1-18 to prepare the digest without the approval of a majority of a quorum of the full conferees committee.</SPAN></P>

The Commission was not properly constituted, and that, consequently, all actions taken by the Commission during that time were void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court also directed the Commission to pay appellee back pay, to award him seniority rights, and to reform itself. The Commission was notified pursuant to W. Va. Code, 7-14B-11 that a position for a temporary correctional officer was available. The Commission was to supply a list of eligible candidates to be certified to the sheriff. One of the members of the Commission changed his political affiliation and the composition of the Commission violated W.Va. Code, 7-14B-3. The Commission certified a list to the sheriff, but appellee's name was not included. He filed a petition for a writ of mandamus. Upon review, the court found that at the time the Commission put together the list, it had a de jure existence, but the appropriate individuals were not occupying de jure positions within the organization. However, the individuals were de facto officers, and they were not precluded from performing valid acts insofar as the public and third persons were concerned. Because it was only the Commission's duty to certify a list of eligible candidates and it had no authority to hire or pay correctional officers, it could not be compelled to award appellee back pay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the portions of the judgment that found the acts of the Commission void and that related to the hiring or back pay of appellee. The writ of mandamus in that regard was declared a nullity. In all other respects, it was upheld.</SPAN></P>

The trial court declared that the ordinance was constitutional. On appeal the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that W. Va.

The court stated that the statute met the constitutional standard for obscenity because it embodied the general obscenity test authorized by the United States Supreme Court and incorporated specific examples of obscenity set out by the United States Supreme Court. The court noted that the ordinance's language tracked the statute's and was therefore facially constitutional. The court found that the statute's language was complete and unambiguous and while counties could decide whether and in what form to adopt a pornography ordinance, it could not be made more restrictive that the form already adopted by the legislature.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted after the death of her daughter. The State asserted that defendant committed felonious neglect when she took her daughter to a party where the daughter was encouraged to drink alcohol until she lost consciousness. Defendant then had the girl taken home a put to bed, where she was found dead the next morning. The circuit court dismissed the indictment on the grounds that the term &quot;neglect&quot; as used in &sect; 61-8D-4(b) was unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed holding that the statute passed constitutional muster. The term &quot;neglect&quot; was defined in W. Va. Code &sect; 61-8D-1(6) (1988) and was not itself vague. &quot;Neglect&quot; as defined by &sect; 61-8D-1(6) was the unreasonable failure by a parent to exercise a minimum degree of care to assure a minor child's physical safety or health. W. Va. Code &sect; 61-8D-4(b) was based on a negligence concept and did not require specific intent. Thus, the use of the term &quot;neglect&quot; in &sect; 61-8D-4(b) did not create unconstitutional vagueness because the use of the term gave persons of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his or her contemplated conduct was prohibited and it also provided adequate standards for adjudication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board relied upon a decision from the court holding W. Va. Code &sect; 30-14-8a (1987) void and revoked the doctor's license. He had been granted a license previously based upon &sect; 30-14-8a, which provided for the permanent licensure of any resident physician who had held a temporary certificate in West Virginia prior to January 1, 1987. The doctor was otherwise not qualified to practice medicine in West Virginia, having repeatedly failed the Federation of Licensing Boards Examination (FLEX exam). The doctor appealed, contending that the board's decision to void &sect; 30-14-8a should not apply retroactively. The circuit court affirmed the board's decision. On appeal, the court held that: (1) where &sect; 30-14-8a was of recent origin and was a radical departure from prior practice, the doctor did not have any settled expectation arising from a longstanding practice; (2) where &sect; 30-14-8a affected a narrow class of physicians, retroactive application of the ruling was more sustainable; (3) there was a substantial public policy served in requiring doctors to pass the FLEX exam; and (4) therefore, the circuit court was correct in giving retroactive application to the ruling voiding &sect; 30-14-8a.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision from the circuit court, which affirmed the board's revocation of the doctor's license.</SPAN></P>

Va. Code &sect;&sect; 20-3A-1 to 20-3A-8 (the Act), after the trial court granted a motion to strike defendant ski resort's defense under the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife filed suit against the ski resort for personal injuries sustained while the husband disembarked from a ski lift at the ski resort. The wife sued for loss of spousal consortium. The ski resort contended that the action was barred by the Act. The husband and wife moved to strike the defense that the action was barred by the Act, which limited the ski resort's liability. The trial court eventually granted the motion to strike, based upon its conclusion that the Act was unconstitutional in that it violated equal protection principles of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 10, and U.S. Const. amend. 14, &sect; 1; the &quot;open courts&quot; provision of W. Va. Const. art. III, &sect; 17; and the proscription against special legislation of W. Va. Const. art. VI, &sect; 39. Subsequently, the trial court certified questions to the court regarding the constitutionality of the Act. The court concluded that the Act was constitutional on its face despite the claims that it denied equal protection or constituted impermissible special legislation, or violated the &quot;certain remedy&quot; provision of the state's constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the certified questions by finding the Act constitutional and remanded to the trial court with instructions to deny the motion of the husband and wife to strike the ski resort's affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landowners under a tax deed challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Wayne County (West Virginia), which voided the tax deed based on the invalidity of W.Va. Code &sect; 11A-3-2(1965) and granted plaintiff, a representative of the prior deceased owners, summary judgment as to the issue of laches in the representative's action to set aside the tax deed and for adverse possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The representative was the daughter of the prior owners, who were both deceased. About 25 years earlier, the lot was purchased by a sheriff on behalf of West Virginia for nonpayment of ad valorem real property taxes. Pursuant to W. Va. Code &sect; 11A-3-2 (1965), advance notice of the sheriff's tax sale was not required to be mailed to the prior owners. Three years later, a tax deed was delivered to the landowners. However, the representative and her parents, the prior owners, continued to reside at the property. When the prior owners died, the representative learned that the landowners owned the lot and she sought to void the tax deed to the landowners. The court held that a holding that &sect; 11A-3-2 was invalid because it permitted the sale of real property without personal notice to affected owners and others having an interest in the property was not to be applied retroactively. The court explained that such a general retroactive application had a severe disruptive effect on land titles in West Virginia. The court further held that there were issues of fact remaining as to the representative's allegations of laches and adverse possession and that summary judgment was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that the tax sale was void, vacated the summary judgment as to laches, and remanded for further proceedings on a related issue of adverse possession raised in the pleadings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State Department of Tax and Revenue (department) sought review of the decision of the Circuit Court of Hancock County (West Virginia), which vacated plaintiff taxpayer's past-due tax, additions to tax, and penalties, and held that the taxpayer was considered to be in the business of contracting for purposes of the consumers sales and service and use tax exemptions for the purchase of things used in the business of contracting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a speculative builder, challenged the taxes assessed by the department. The trial court granted judgment for the taxpayer. The court reversed, in part, and affirmed, in part, the trial court's decision. The court held that speculative builders were not considered as engaged in the business of contracting for purposes of the consumers sales and service tax exemption and use tax exemption, for purchases of things directly used or consumed in the business of contracting. Speculative builders were engaged in the business activity of constructing improvements to real property that they owned with the intent of selling the improved realty to other persons. It was not an equal protection violation for the department to treat actual contractors differently from speculative builders because there was a rational basis for treating the two classes differently. Speculative builders were essentially engaged in sales of their own improved realty, whereas contractors worked under contracts for the owners of real estate. Because the taxpayer had a good faith belief that his position was legal, the court affirmed the trial court's order vacating his additions to tax and penalties.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 61-3-39 (1977), which related to the issuance of a worthless check in exchange for property or a thing of value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed his conviction but remanded for a new sentence. The court found that W.Va. Code &sect; 61-3-39 (1977) and W. Va. Code &sect; 61-3-39(a) (1977) were not constitutionally vague and were clear in their use of terms. The court held that defendant obtained an interest in a commercial lease when he issued a worthless check for a security deposit and that the lease represented a thing of value under W. Va. Code &sect; 61-3-39. The court concluded that defendant was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction because the statutes considered completely different crimes. The court also found that the trial judge based his sentencing decision on the total circumstances not the limits of W. Va. Code &sect; 61-3-39(a) (1977). The court also held that defendant was not prejudiced by the prosecutor's remarks during his arguments in closing statements. Finally, the court found that defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 1 to 10 years, but the maximum under law was only 1 to 5 years for his crime, and the court remanded the case for a sentence correction.</SPAN></P>
