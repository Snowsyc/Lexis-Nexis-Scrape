</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska), which convicted him of unlawfully and knowingly or intentionally possessing with the intent to distribute, deliver, or dispense a controlled substance, heroin, after overruling his motion to quash the indictment because it was returned by a grand jury composed in a manner prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover narcotics officer made heroin purchases at defendant's home from the principal, who was living with defendant and his wife. On review, the court found that there was substantial evidence to support the verdict, taking the view most favorable to the State. There was evidence that defendant had sufficient control or dominion over the heroin to be able to assist the officer in exchanging unsatisfactory heroin and of an intent to deliver. Further, the evidence established, under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-201 (Reissue 1943), that defendant aided and abetted the principal in his sale and delivery of the drugs to the officer. Defendant contended that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-1601 (Supp. 1974), which provided that grand jurors must be over the age of 21 years and under the age of 70 years, amounted to a deliberate and systematic exclusion of an entire class of 19 and 20 year old voters, depriving him of his right to due process and rendering his indictment void. The court held that the specified age groups were not a cognizable class of the &quot;young&quot; and their interests and attitudes were reasonably represented by the 21 year olds and other young people who were permitted to serve.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a judgment of the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska), which held Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1401 (Reissue 1943) constitutional and granted judgment on the pleadings to defendants, the city, county, and chamber of commerce, in the taxpayer's class action challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 18-1401 upon the ground that it allegedly violated Neb. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city and county gave funds to the chamber for the purpose of paying debts it incurred in conducting a publicity campaign under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1401 (Reissue 1943). The taxpayer sought to have &sect; 18-1401 declared unconstitutional as violative of Neb. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3 in that it authorized defendants, without guidelines or restrictions, to purchase with public funds real estate suitable for industrial development and to acquire options on real estate for industrial development. The district court held the statute constitutional and granted defendants judgment on the pleadings, and the taxpayer appealed. On review, the court affirmed in part, holding that the portion of the provision authorizing expenditures for the purpose of carrying on a publicity campaign was constitutional. However, the court reversed in part, holding that the provision of &sect; 18-1401 authorizing expenditures for the purpose of acquiring real estate was unconstitutional in violation of Neb. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3. The unconstitutional provisions were separable because the provision for real estate acquisition was not the exclusive inducement for the increased funding provision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's judgment in part, finding the statutory provision that authorized the expenditure of funds in conducting a publicity campaign was constitutional, and reversed in part as to the provision that allowed defendants to authorize expenditures for the purpose of acquiring real estate. The court remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with killing an individual in the perpetration of a robbery. The trial court suppressed a statement made by defendant but allowed other statements that were made later. The trial court jury found defendant guilty of first degree murder. Defendant claimed there was no probable cause for his warrantless arrest and that all the statements he made to the police were involuntary. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the facts and circumstances known to the police officers at the moment of arrest were clearly sufficient to constitute probable cause justifying the arrest. The court ruled that the evidence sufficiently established the insulation of defendant's first statement from those that followed to comply with Miranda. The court held that a 10-hour time interval intervened between the two statements, during which defendant or his father had time and opportunity to consult with counsel but did not do so. The court ruled that the totality of the circumstances supported the conclusion that defendant's statements were given voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently, and were not constitutionally defective.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 28-729 was constitutional under the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and Neb. Const. art.

The court held that although the prosecutor did make an improper remark during his closing argument, defendant had waived the error by his failure to object at trial. The court held that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to go into the reasons why defendant's prior probation had been extended, but the error was not so prejudicial that it required reversal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff passenger appealed a decision of the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska), which sustained the demurrer filed by defendant, truck rental company and unknown truck operator, to the passenger's petition for a joint and several judgment against the company and the operator under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-6, 193 (Reissue 1943) (statute). The trial court found that the statute violated the Constitutions of Nebraska and the United States.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator, who gave false identification when he rented the truck, fled the scene of an accident in which the passenger was injured, and was never found. The company demurred to the passenger's petition and argued that the statute unconstitutionally violated the Fourteenth Amendment and Neb. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 3. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that the statute was a proper exercise of police power since it was designed to promote highway safety and financially protect innocent traffic victims. Rejecting the company's argument, the court held that the legislature had a reasonable basis for distinguishing rental trucks from other vehicles since rental trucks were heavier and were often operated by persons without special skill. Thus, they could be considered more dangerous. The court stated that since the statute provided that a lessor would be held &quot;jointly and severally liable&quot; with its lessee, a company could not be held liable under the statute unless its lessee was also liable. Thus, the court noted that this would protect the company from liability in situations where its lessee lent the truck to another without the company's knowledge or consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment which had found the statute to be unconstitutional and had sustained the company's demurrer to the passenger's petition; the court remanded and suggested that the passenger amend his petition to allege the identity of and facts showing the liability of both the company and the operator.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A defendant was on trial for a multiple murder. Prior to trial, the prosecution, joined by the defendant, sought an order restricting the media's pretrial publicity of the murder trial. The county court granted the prosecution's motion. The defendant was bound over to the district court and the media moved to intervene in the murder prosecution so it could challenge the constitutionality of the trial court's order. The district court granted the motion to intervene, then terminated the county court's order and imposed its own order restricting the media's pretrial publicity. The media challenged that order by seeking review and separately seeking a writ of mandamus. While the actions were pending, the media sought relief from the U.S. Supreme Court, which eventually granted a partial stay of the district court's order. The court took jurisdiction to resolve state procedural issues and found that the media had no right to intervene in a criminal proceeding, that the district court's order was void insofar as it impinged too greatly on the freedom of the press, but that some restriction on the media's coverage of the defendant's confession was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the inferences of guilt from the circumstantial evidence were strong and were practically conclusive if the jury disbelieved defendant's explanations. The trial court did not err in overruling defendant's pretrial motion seeking to prohibit the prosecutor from questioning him concerning cash purportedly found in his home because he had waived his right to have the physical evidence suppressed by failing to make a timely suppression motion and could not avoid the consequence of waiver by filing an untimely motion to limit interrogation.

Defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, defendant alleged that the district court erred in failing to suppress his confession, that defense counsel's cross-examination was improperly limited, that his plea in abatement was improperly overruled, and that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support his conviction. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's confession was voluntary and admissible because defendant, who was 3 days from turning 18 years of age, was informed of his constitutional rights before he voluntarily waived them. Defendant's age was not sufficient in and of itself to vitiate his confession. The court also rejected defendant's argument as to the insufficiency of the evidence because there was no new and intervening cause between the time of defendant's acts and the death of the victim.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his motion to suppress evidence, and defendant was convicted of possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, deliver, or dispense, possession of amphetamines, and possession of cocaine. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's constitutional challenge to &sect; 60-435, holding that the trooper's brief detention of defendant in order to verify his driver's license and registration did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. The court further held that the stop pursuant to &sect; 60-435 did not need to be based on any suspicions of defendant's involvement in criminal activity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator state bar association brought an original disciplinary proceeding against respondent county attorney, charging him with violations of Neb. Code Prof. Resp. DR 7-102(A) and 8-101(A)(2). Following the report of a referee recommending censure or reprimand upon a finding of ethical violations, the state bar noted its exceptions thereto.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When respondent took office, he discovered that his predecessor had left many outstanding tax sale certificates. The legislature then passed Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-1918 (Reissue 1971), which was an amendment to prior law and which provided that $ 50 be paid to a county attorney for each property sold pursuant to a decree of foreclosure of a certificate. Respondent did not carefully read the amended statute before he instituted foreclosure proceedings on several certificates. He then filed claims for services with the county, even though decrees had not been entered, as required for payment under &sect; 77-1918. When he discovered his error, respondent repaid the funds improperly paid to him. The state bar accused him of concealing facts, making false statements, and misusing his public position. The supreme court ruled that respondent was clearly negligent in failing to know the law and in filing false claims, thereby making false statements of law or fact, in violation of Neb. Code Prof. Resp. DR 7-102(A)(5). However, the evidence did not support findings that he was guilty of intentional concealment or using his position to influence the board of county commissioners in his favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was found to have knowingly made a false statement of law or fact, in violation of the disciplinary rules, but the other charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. A judgment of censure was entered against him, with an admonition that he thoroughly study the code of professional responsibility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the school district's appeal from the industrial court's order, it argued that the Association had failed to exhaust its remedies under the Nebraska Teachers' Professional Negotiations Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 79-1287 et seq. (Reissue 1943), prior to bringing suit because it did not file a required certificate under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-314 (Reissue 1943). The district also argued that the Act was unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that the district had previously chosen not to recognize the Association on grounds other than its failure to comply with the Act, and it was not able to change its rationale after litigation began. The legislature's plenary power over school districts included the authority to require the exhaustion of remedies under the Act. The legislature had the power, by virtue of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, to entrust to the industrial court authority pertaining to labor relations of governmental services. The industrial court was an administrative body, and the constitutional prohibition against the delegation of judicial authority to nonjudicial bodies was not violated because its quasi-judicial powers were purely incidental.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that arresting officers violated his civil rights under the color of police authority by subjecting him to a warrantless, illegal arrest. His motion alleged that the officers forcibly entered his sister's home and arrested him without a warrant. After he was arrested, he confessed. The suppression of his confession as involuntary was his focus during the trial and on appeal. The court held that the trial court correctly denied an evidentiary hearing because: (1) the motion did not allege facts which showed a violation of constitutional rights that would make the judgment void or voidable; (2) the alleged illegal arrest issue did not have to be considered because the facts and circumstances were fully known to the defendant at the time of trial and were not raised there or on direct appeal; (3) defendant failed to raise his claim of an illegal arrest as an additional possible ground for suppression at the trial level even though all the facts on which it might have been based were known to him; and (4) the record of the suppression hearing and the trial disclosed no constitutional violations making the judgment void or voidable.</SPAN></P>

The district court also issued a directed verdict in favor of the driver on the issue of gross negligence. The case involved application of the Nebraska guest statute, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-6, 191 (Reissue 1943).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger was injured when the speeding automobile collided with the slow-moving tractor. In the subsequent negligence action brought against the driver, the passenger was awarded damages, however her gross negligence claim was dismissed. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court first concluded that the Nebraska guest statute did not violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Nebraska Constitution. The denial of a remedy for negligently-inflicted injuries to automobile guests was rationally related to several legitimate state purposes, including the prevention of collusion and fraud. The court then concluded that the driver's actions, considered together, constituted gross negligence; he failed to keep a proper lookout for a vehicle in the same lane of traffic, and continuously and persistently operated his automobile at a reckless and excessive rate of speed. The driver violated the range of vision rule and did not take advantage of the ample opportunity to avoid the collision. The court also found that the evidence was sufficient to submit the question of the driver's gross negligence to the jury. The matter was remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

However, the court determined that, under provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq., exclusive power was vested in the ICC to regulated the distribution of railroad cars. The ICC also had exclusive power to suspend administrative order-making due process pursuant to a declaration of emergency because of equipment shortage, priorities in use on a national level, or congestion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County contended that &sect; 29-1804.12 was unconstitutional. The court rejected the County's appeal because it was not a party entitled to bring an appeal to the court pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-1912 (Reissue 1943). The proceedings in the district court were criminal, instituted and carried out to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused parties. From a review of the state statutes, the court determined that only one convicted of an offense had a right to appeal in a criminal matter. The court found no authority that the County could appeal from the district court's order awarding attorney's fees to the indigent defendants' attorney, even though a state statute required the county to pay such fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the District Court for Sarpy County (Nebraska), which convicted him of having concealed certain cattle he knew had been stolen, a violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-150 (Reissue 1943). He argued, in part, that the statute was unconstitutional and that his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel was violated when his counsel failed to move for a discharge pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-1208 (Supp. 1972).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded not guilty, waived trial by jury, and was tried by the court. His trial commenced more than six months after the filing of the information against him. On appeal, the court found that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the verdict. The court refused to hear arguments regarding the constitutionality of the statute under which he was convicted because that issue was not raised before the trial court and that court had no opportunity to rule upon it. The court held that if defendant claimed to have a right to absolute discharge due to the State's violation of his speedy trial right pursuant to &sect; 29-1208, he had to raise that issue by a timely motion. The court declined to decide whether his counsel's failure to file that motion was ineffective assistance of counsel because that matter could not be decided without an evidentiary hearing. The evidence that would bear on the determination, such as trial counsel's testimony, was not shown in the trial record. The trial court had no duty to suggest that defendant file a motion for discharge or to suggest to him that he had a right to do so. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-1209 (Supp. 1972) placed that burden on defendant.</SPAN></P>

The District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska) directed a verdict of dismissal at the end of the passenger's case. The passenger appealed from that verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accident causing the passenger's injuries occurred when the driver suddenly passed out while driving his car and it struck a telephone pole. The passenger argued that the question of whether he was a passenger and not a guest in the driver's car should have been submitted to the jury. The evidence showed that on three occasions the passenger gave the driver $ 2 in connection with picking him up at the airport after his weekend trips to Chicago. During the week the driver had been taking the passenger to work regularly and it was on one of these occasions that the accident happened. The court held that the passenger was a guest within the purview of the guest statute,&nbsp;Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-740 (Reissue 1943) in that there was no evidence of any payment on the trip in which the accident occurred. Further, the court determined that the airport &quot;payments&quot; were purely gratuitous, resulting from hospitality and friendship between the parties. The passenger next argued that the trial court erred in holding that the driver was not guilty of gross negligence. The court held that losing consciousness was not per se evidence sufficient to submit to the jury the issue of gross negligence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district entered into a contract with the grantors to purchase land. One of the grantors was a school board member. The taxpayers filed an action against defendants to declare the contract null and void due to the interests of the board member. The proposed remedy in the petition was to direct repayment of the purchase price with interest. However, the taxpayers amended their petition. The amended petition requested affirmation of the contract and restoration of the purchase price. The taxpayers requested that the board member refund the purchase price and that the district be allowed to keep the land. The trial court sustained a demurrer filed by the district. Thereafter, the trial court dismissed the taxpayers' petition against the grantors, finding that the transaction was not prohibited by law and that the board member did not attempt to influence the district's decision to acquire the land. The taxpayers appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the taxpayers were not entitled to the relief sought. The court reasoned that there could be no recovery of the purchase price where the land remained unchanged and could have been readily returned.</SPAN></P>

The officer placed defendant with another officer and examined the trash bin. Upon investigation, the officer found a loaded .22 caliber revolver in the trash bin.

The district court declared the Act constitutional. The court reversed and remanded. The Act furnished textbooks to private sectarian schools. The cost was paid by a public appropriation of tax funds. The textbooks were used and given to students in educational institutions that were not exclusively owned and controlled by the state or a governmental subdivision. The court held that the Act was in violation of Neb. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11. By aiding the parents and the students with textbooks, the state was providing a program for aiding the church and in advancing religious education.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 53-166.01 to 53-166.17 (Supp. 1972) (act), which regulated the distribution of beer and alcoholic liquors, to be constitutional. The manufacturers claimed that the act impaired the obligation of contracts, unduly restricted the right of freedom to contract, was vague and indefinite, tended to destroy competition and foster monopolies, and bore no reasonable relation to the public health and welfare. The court reversed the trial court judgment and remanded the case with directions to declare the act unconstitutional. The court found that the purpose of the act was to foster and promote temperance and obedience to the law and to protect distributors against termination of their franchises without cause. The court held that the effect of the act upon temperance or obedience was remote and speculative, would not regulate the retail distribution of products, and would have little or no effect upon public's consumption. The court held that the act was vague and indefinite and concluded that it was an unreasonable invasion of the personal and property rights of the manufacturers.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's appeal is premised on the proceedings relative to the habitual criminal count. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court found that there was nothing neither vague nor indefinite about the sentence imposed on defendant. The court stated that defendant understood the habitual criminal count only enhanced the sentence and further understood that the minimum he could receive was 10 years. The court stated that because defendant knew what was happening and wanted the district court to take his plea without further delay, the statutory procedures under Neb. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tuition aid statute provided for public grants to students in need of tuition aid to attend private colleges. The state treasurer refused to countersign a warrant upon the treasury that was issued in payment of the student's request for reimbursement of an expense incurred under the statute. The student filed an action in mandamus to compel the state treasurer to act. The trial court determined that the tuition aid statute violated the state constitution and denied the student any relief. On appeal, the court affirmed and further held in favor of the state treasurer on its counterclaim. The student was merely a conduit through which the funds were funneled to an educational institution not controlled by the state. It was a patent attempt to sanction by indirection that which the constitution forbade. The tuition aid statute violated Neb. Const. art. VII, &sect; 11. There was no attempt made to restrict the use of the tuition funds provided by the state solely to secular subjects. In some institutions the tuition aid financed sectarian subjects. The tuition aid statute also violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dairy argued that the state lacked the authority, under its police power, to control the economics of the dairy's business in buying, selling, packaging, and distributing dairy products. The act challenged by the dairy established the Board to determine the minimum basic cost to the distributor. All distributors were prohibited from selling below the minimum basic cost no matter what their actual cost was. The dairy argued that this discriminated against it because it was more efficient than other distributors and could have had a greater sales volume by selling at a lower price. The trial court held that the act was constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the act, rather than preventing a monopoly, actually promoted one. The extension of the police power was not needed to ensure a wholesome product. The minimum basic costs provisions of the act were unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious in that they purported to fix a minimum basic cost that bore no relation to, and was not justified by, any requirement of the public interest. Thus the provisions were an unnecessary and unwarranted interference with individual liberty.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 77-202.25 to -202.33 (Supp. 1972), which provided for an increasing exemption from taxation of the actual value of agricultural income-producing machinery and farm inventories, with certain exceptions, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The exemptions granted pertained to property used in agricultural production, the products thereof, and business inventories. The statute also directed the State Treasurer to place sufficient revenue from sales and income taxes in a Personal Property Tax Relief Fund to reimburse counties for revenue lost. The court held that the amendment of Neb. Const. art. VII, &sect; 2 specifically conferred broad authority on the legislature to classify and exempt personal property from taxation. Thus, Neb. Stat. &sect;&sect; 77-202.25 to -202.33 (Supp. 1972) did not violate Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18, dealing with special laws, or Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, requiring uniform taxation. Moreover, the classification set forth in the statute was not unreasonable because partial exemptions of property from taxation had long been recognized and approved. Classification for tax purposes may be based on the manner of conducting business, and business conducted in one manner may be taxed differently from business conducted in another manner, based on a legislative intent to equalize the tax burden. Because the statute was a valid taxing measure, it was not rendered invalid by its appropriation provision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the State of Nebraska, sought review of the decision of the District Court for Hall County (Nebraska), which entered judgment in favor of plaintiff landowner in a declaratory judgment action by the landowner to have the State Boat Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 81-815.01 to 81-815.20 (1943), declared unconstitutional in its application to the landowner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the landowner's action was filed, the State filed a demurrer, which was overruled. The trial court, without passing on the constitutionality of the Act, then entered a permanent injunction against the State, restraining it from applying the Act to the landowner's property. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that demurrer should have been sustained because the Act was applicable to the landowner's property. The court determined that the Act applied both to the operation of boats on public and private waters. The court further held that there were no facts alleged from which it could be concluded that the State had in the past enforced the Act by illegal means and an injunction could only lie against officials performing their official duties when they had acted illegally in the past. The court concluded that the demurrer should have been sustained because the injunction prohibited lawful as well as possible unlawful entries upon the landowner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, dissolved the injunction, and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of committing a series of rapes and a robbery over a two-year period. Defendant was sentenced under the Sexual Sociopath Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 29-2901 to 29-2910 (1972). He appealed, and the court affirmed. The investigative stop of defendant and subsequent arrest after he attempted to dispose of a knife were proper. Police had probable cause to stop defendant because defendant's unusual conduct was reported to police and he was stopped in a car matching a description given to police of the car used by the perpetrator of the crimes. The police then had probable cause to arrest defendant because he attempted to dispose of a knife, which happened to match the description of a knife reported as taken during a burglary, after police stopped him. Probable cause justifying an arrest without warrant existed if the facts and circumstances known to the arresting officer warranted a prudent man in believing an offense had been committed and that defendant committed it. Here, numerous offenses had been committed and probable cause existed for believing that defendant had committed those offenses.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the evidence did not support a finding that the seller alone was liable and that the distributor was not liable to the buyer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prosecution witness testified that he and defendant stole copper from a gutted building, transported it to a dump where no watchman was present, retrieved the copper and transported it to an ironworks where they sold it, dividing the proceeds. The testimony of the witness exhibited ill will against defendant, some self-contradiction, and some contradiction of testimony by a disinterested witness. The witness denied a bargain for immunity although the county judge at a preliminary hearing had bound the witness over to district court and the county attorney prior to the trial of defendant did not prosecute the witness there. The court held that the ruling of the district court denying defendant's motion to strike the witness' testimony was correct. The evidence was sufficient for a jury properly to find that defendant did not participate in the larceny but that he was guilty of the offense of receiving stolen property. The habitual criminal statute, which granted the prosecutor discretion whether to charge the facts referable to habitual criminality, did not impose cruel and unusual punishment or provide for punishment of a status in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers sought judicial review of a decision made by appellee, the Nebraska State Tax Commissioner (Commissioner), which assessed deficiencies in their personal income tax returns for tax year 1968. The District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska) sustained the Commissioner's demurrer and dismissed the taxpayers' petitions. The taxpayers appealed the dismissals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the enactment of the Nebraska Revenue Act of 1967 (Act), which was effective January 1, 1968, the Commissioner promulgated regulations under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 77-2701 to 77-27,135 in an attempt to rectify problems that the Legislature anticipated were created with reference to the preparation of state income tax returns during the transition period. The taxpayers were members of fiscal year partnerships whose tax year ended in 1968. The Commissioner's interpretive regulation, Neb. Tax Code &sect; 27-3,required the taxpayers to include all of their partnership income, including the 1968 income, in their respective 1967 personal state income tax returns. In reversing the dismissal of the taxpayers' petitions, the court sustained the taxpayers' challenge to the interpretive regulation, and held that the regulation failed to implement the legislative intent with reference to other income items of partnerships. The court stated that the net effect of the Commissioner's treatment of the income in these cases was to have the Act take effect sometime in 1967 insofar as it related to partners who were members of partnerships having a fiscal year ending in 1968.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of the taxpayers' petitions, insofar as their challenges related to the treatment of partnership and S Corporation income, was reversed. That portion of the lower court's judgment that dismissed the petitions as they related to the treatment of capital gains and losses was affirmed. The cases were remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district's board voted not to recognize the association as the representative for its teachers. The association then filed this action requesting the court of industrial relations to resolve its dispute with the district. The court found an apparent conflict between Neb. Rev.

Section 48-837 gave teachers the right to organize, but &sect; 79-1290, in the TPNA, provided that no school board was required to meet or confer with a representative unless a majority of the board recognized the representative. Further, the court of industrial relations did not have jurisdiction until the TPNA's remedies were exhausted. The court harmonized the statutes. When the school district refused to recognize the association, it exhausted the TPNA's remedies. The court of industrial relations then acquired jurisdiction to resolve the dispute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police obtained a warrant to search defendant's home and car for animal traps that were stolen in a burglary. During the search, officers found many old and new traps. While the warrant and inventory return were filed shortly thereafter, the affidavit supporting the warrant was not filed for several weeks. A motion to quash the warrant and suppress the evidence was denied. At trial, an accomplice testified under a grant of immunity, while defendant testified that he had obtained the traps months before the burglary. Defendant was convicted and he appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that the affidavit established probable cause for the warrant and the failure to strictly comply with Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-812 et seq. (Reissue 1943) in the late filing of the affidavit did not invalidate the search, especially since no prejudice was shown. Defendant's equal protection rights were not violated by the state's power to grant immunity where the defense had no such right because equal protection was applicable only as between persons. The sentence imposed was within the statutory range under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-532 (Reissue 1943) and it was neither excessive nor an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in a Nebraska trial court on charges of motor vehicle homicide, which he did not appeal. He was sentenced to a term of 8 to 10 years' imprisonment. He filed pro se a motion for post-conviction relief, and an amended motion was filed by his counsel. He appealed the denial of an evidentiary hearing on his motion for post conviction relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a fatal automobile accident. Three or four hours after the accident the police went to his house and took him to the hospital for specimens to check his blood alcohol content. He complied with the request. He was later questioned by a district attorney and gave a statement without an attorney. In his amended motion for post conviction relief he asserted that his constitutional right against self-incrimination had been violated, as well as his Miranda rights, and that the Nebraska Implied Consent Law was unconstitutional. The court noted that his original allegations were improper attempts to appeal his conviction. It held that the implied consent law did not violate his privilege against self-incrimination, and that the law as drafted had passed constitutional muster in earlier cases. Defendant had waived all of his rights in the preliminary interview in the district attorney's office, and the statement he gave was not prejudicial to him in that it was entirely exculpatory and could not be construed as an admission against interest. In reviewing the trial record as a whole the court determined that defendant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order that denied defendant's request for an evidentiary hearing and that overruled his motion for post conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant real estate license applicant challenged a decision of the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska), which upheld a ruling of the Nebraska Real Estate Commission denying the applicant's request for a broker's license, and dismissed the applicant's appeal from that ruling. The Commission based its decision on evidence that the applicant's insurance broker's license had been revoked because of fraudulent and dishonest conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant argued that he was entitled to a license because he met all of the statutory licensing requirements and that the Commission lacked discretion to deny licenses in such situations. On appeal, the court disagreed. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-882(1) (Reissue 1943) constituted a specific delegation of discretionary authority to the Commission with regard to the granting of an application for a license as well as for the revocation or suspension of a license already granted. The real estate statutes did not expressly state that the Commission was authorized to determine whether an applicant was a fit and proper person to engage in the licensed business. However, the court found that the requirement that applicants possess good moral character was implicit in the qualifications necessary for a license, and that in the absence of mandatory statutory requirements, the power vested in the Commission implicitly carried the power to exercise reasonable discretion in granting or refusing licenses. Given the applicant's record, the court held that the Commission's ruling was reasonable and did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Thus, the decision of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a labor action instituted by the teachers' association, against the school district, the industrial relations court ordered the school district to negotiate with the teachers' association. When the parties failed to settle the issue relating to a salary schedule, the industrial relations court established a salary scale. The school district challenged the constitutionality of the legislation creating the industrial relations court. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, holding that the legislature had the authority to create the industrial relations court. The court first held that Neb. Const. art. XV, &sect; 9, which provided for the creation of the industrial commission, was an exception to Neb. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, which provided that legislative power was vested in the legislature. The court found that Neb. Const. art. VII, &sect; 14 specifically authorized the legislature to delegate its legislative power to the education department. The court then held that pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 48-816 to 48-818 (Supp. 1969), the industrial relations court had the authority to settle any controversy and order the parties to negotiate.</SPAN></P>

The driver appealed to the district court, which found generally for DMV, denied the driver's claims for relief, and dismissed the action. The court affirmed. The driver was not denied due process based on the lack of notice or hearing prior to the order of revocation because it was a ministerial act by DMV's Director, and the appeal procedures contemplated a full evidentiary hearing that met the due process requirements of both the federal and state constitutions. The scope of review in the district court was not impermissibly restricted to the sole issue of whether the Director's records sustained the final order. Completely void judgments, erroneous or fraudulent records, and abstracts of convictions could be challenged de novo in the district. The driver's claim that the ordinance under which he was finally convicted was unconstitutionally vague was res judicata because it was not raised at his trial on that charge, and the conviction was not challenged.</SPAN></P>

The court held that this contention was without merit because knowledge that an injury has occurred was an essential element of the offense. The court also held that if defendant was placed on probation and permitted to continue as a responsible member of society, it was highly unlikely that he would ever again appear before the bar of justice. Therefore, the court held that, under the circumstances, the interests of defendant and of society required that he be granted probation on appropriate terms to be delineated by the trial judge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because of a shortage of space in the buildings, the school district entered into a lease with a private religious school for the use of one classroom full time and a second classroom half time. The school district would have control over the classrooms and the educational program; and that no objects, pictures, or other articles having a religious meaning or connotation would be in the classrooms. Defendants refused the school district's application for a grant of federal funds to provide instructional activities and services to meet special educational needs of educationally deprived children. The trial court found generally for the school district and ordered defendants to approve the application, and the court affirmed. Defendants conceded that it was not ipso facto unlawful for a public school district to lease property from a church-affiliated organization or institution for public school purposes. The court suggested that to deny a student the right to participate in a program offered by a public school district solely because that student was enrolled in a parochial school violated that student's right to a free exercise of religion and to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers sought review of the decision of the District Court of Douglas County (Nebraska), which ruled that a statute authorizing certain cities and counties joint authority through defendant public building commission to construct buildings for public use was partially constitutional and partially unconstitutional. The commission cross-appealed the district court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 23-2601 to 23-2612 (Supp. 1971), which authorized the establishment of a building commission to acquire real property and to levy an annual tax based on the valuation of all taxable property in the county. The statutes were to enable the commission to create and maintain public buildings, structures, and facilities. The taxpayers challenged the legislation on grounds that it unconstitutionally shifted powers of taxation and control from the local governments to the state. The district court enjoined the levy of the tax by the commission finding that particular provision unconstitutional, but holding that the remainder of the statute was constitutional. The court reversed that part of the district court's holding that the statute was unconstitutional. The statute establishing the building commission for the county and city pertained to matters of state concern and, therefore, did not unconstitutionally contravene the home rule city's charter. Further, the legislation did not unconstitutionally levy taxes for corporate purposes as it was not levied for corporate propriety purposes, but for public purposes.</SPAN></P>

The Board brought the action under the provisions of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 72-240.11 (Supp.1969).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The improvements involved in the dispute were an irrigation pump and well, and land leveling. Although the evidence was confusing, the court assumed that the irrigation pump and well in dispute were placed on the land prior to 1953 and without direct written permission of the Board. All of the land leveling was done between 1948 and 1953 and was done without specific written permission of the Board. The lessee paid all costs of the improvements. The court concluded that even assuming that the statutes for more than 50 years were unconstitutional for lack of due process in taking the property of lessee tenants without notice, they at least constituted an agreement, express or implied, or an indication and commitment by the state that the lessee of school lands had a compensable interest in improvements placed on the school lands in reliance on the statutes. The court held that a tenant on school lands had a compensable interest in the nature of a property interest in improvements covered by statute and placed on such lands prior to September 14, 1953, notwithstanding the subsequent declaration of unconstitutionality of the statute for lack of due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer sought review of the decision of the District Court for Hall County (Nebraska), which affirmed the decision of the county board to dismiss the taxpayer's claim for a tax refund as barred by the statute of limitations, pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1717 (Reissue 1943), in the taxpayer's action against defendant city for a refund for taxes paid on property unconstitutionally annexed to the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city annexed property of the taxpayer, and the taxpayer paid its annual taxes. The statute, on which the annexation ordinance was based, was declared unconstitutional. More than a year later, the taxpayer filed a claim with the county board for a refund. The board denied the claim. On the taxpayer's appeal, the trial court affirmed the decision and dismissed the action as barred by the statute of limitations. On taxpayer's further appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that the two year statute of limitations, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-1736.04 (Supp. 1967), dealing with tax refunds did not apply in the action, that the legislature had enacted a special one year statute of limitations, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1717 (Reissue), to deal with issues arising from the finding that the annexation ordinance was unconstitutional, and that the later special statute of limitations dealing with annexation controlled over the more general limitation of actions for tax refunds, specifically expressing the legislative will.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A mortgagor had cattle subject to the mortgagee's security interest delivered to the auctioneer for sale at public auction. The auctioneer did not know of the security interest and sold the cattle in the usual course of its business. The mortgagee had no knowledge of the sale and did not consent to it. There had been, prior to the sale, a full public disclosure of the name of the owner by keeping the said name available in the office of the auctioneer to anyone who inquired. In the mortgagee's conversion action, the trial court found that &sect; 69-109.01 was constitutional and afforded protection to the auctioneer, so it was unnecessary to consider the other issues raised. It dismissed the mortgagee's petition with prejudice. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, concluding that while &sect; 69-109.01 did provide an exemption to the decisional law rule that an auctioneer could be liable, the auctioneer had not met all of the conditions, which included that it must have made before the sale a public announcement identifying the property owner. The court also held that the Federal Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 did not exempt the auctioneer, a licensed livestock marketing agency.</SPAN></P>

The district court found that the statutory provision at issue was unconstitutional and severable from the rest of the statute. On appeal, the court reversed. The entire statute was constitutional. In classifying students for the purpose of charging tuition, the State had the legitimate objective of attempting to achieve a partial cost equalization between those persons who had, and those who had not, recently contributed to the State's economy through employment, tax payments, and expenditures within the State. Such an objective was clearly a &quot;reasonable justification&quot; for the discrimination in tuition.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was a complete failure of proof to support the trial court's determinations. The court held that according to the statute, which had been deemed constitutional, the board was required to deduct any balance in the nonresident high school tuition fund after all claims for the preceding year had been paid. However, the court held that the taxpayer failed to submit evidence to show that the statutory mandate was not followed. Further, the court held that the board had no authority to question matters properly lying within the discretionary legislative powers of the school district, nor to determine, as a quasi-judicial body, the legality or illegality of the budget requirements made by a political subdivision to whom the legislature had entrusted the legislative power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedents had once owned an acre of land. On June 20, 1891, they conveyed the parcel by warranty deed to the trustees of a school district. The deed provided that it was to become null and void as soon as the land ceased to be used as school property. No other language in the deed indicated conveyance of an estate lesser than a fee simple absolute. The land was used as school property until November 1968. The successor in interest to the school district then sold the land to the highest bidder. The heirs-at-law argued that the land reverted back to them. Pursuant to 1881 Neb. Laws ch. 78, subdiv. I, &sect;&sect; 2, 13, and 14, a school district had the power to purchase, hold, and sell such property as the law allowed. In 1905, the legislature authorized city school districts to acquire an estate in fee simple absolute by eminent domain. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 76-2102 (Reissue 1943) invalidated any possibility of reverter that had not occurred 30 years from the creation of the possibility of reverter. The court affirmed dismissal of the action. The court held that the school district could transfer the property and that it could no longer revert back to the heirs.</SPAN></P>

The corporation sought an injunction against the district to enjoin alleged violations of the Nebraska Unfair Sales Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 59-1201 to 59-1206 (Reissue 1943). The trial court declared the Act unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The corporation argued that the district's actions were intended to divert trade from other heating fuels in violation of the Act. The trial court found that the challenged provisions, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 59-1202(5), (6), were unconstitutional and not severable from the Act. As such, the Act was declared unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the challenged provisions, which set no standards for determining prices that were justified by prevailing market conditions in the state, were so indefinite an uncertain as to be arbitrary and unreasonable. The court held that the provisions were unconstitutional and invalid and noted that the Act contained no severability clause. Because the provisions were an essential part of the method of computing costs set out in the Act, the court held that the Act was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The hospital district was approved by a majority of the voters, and the trial court upheld the Nebraska Local Hospital District Act, and the formation of the hospital district. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the Legislature intended the county board should have the power to determine the public health, welfare, and convenience of the hospital district. A contrary construction would have been irrational. The fact that the district extended into two or more counties did not render the Legislature powerless to include contiguous tracts into one district for the more convenient exercise of the police power. The creation of the hospital district was a legislative act and no guidelines were constitutionally required beyond the requirement that the county board had to find that the district would be conducive to the public health and welfare and set the boundaries after a hearing afforded to all persons interested.</SPAN></P>

The city was authorized to execute and attest the lease-purchase agreement by ordinance. The court concluded that the lease-purchase agreement was not an invalid franchise.

Statute as written delegated to the person using self-defense the decision to set out what force was reasonable, which violated the Nebraska Constitution because the constitution places with the legislature the power to set laws and penalties.

Defendant admitted the act and the court assumed, for purposes of the appeal, that the victim consented to the act and that defendant believed her to be previously unchaste and to be older than 15. On appeal, the court ruled, inter alia, that: (1) defendant's claim that &sect; 28-408 violated equal protection principals because it permitted a defendant to assert consent as a defense when the victim was over 15 years, if she was previously unchaste, but the defense was not available if the victim was previously chaste, was meritless. The act that constituted the crime was depriving a female within the age limits of her virginal chastity, and this was a proper and not an unreasonable classification; (2) the statute was not invalid for not including intent or knowledge as an element of the crime because no intent was requisite other than that evidenced by the doing of the act constituting the offense; (3) a mistake or lack of information on the victim's chastity was no defense, and thus defendant was properly denied an instruction that a reasonable belief as to the victim's previous unchastity was a complete defense to the crime.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-168 (1969), which prohibited wholesalers from giving discounts for quantity purchases to retailers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State sought to apply Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-168 (1969) to the alcohol sellers. The alcohol sellers filed a complaint to enjoin the application of the statute. Judgment was entered in favor of the alcohol sellers, and the statute was declared unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that, while due process protected the alcohol sellers, the State had a right, pursuant to its police power, to enforce regulations in the public interest. The court determined that the sale of alcohol was one properly regulated by the State and that the regulation that prohibited the giving of discounts to certain retailers was a proper regulation as it helped prevent improper practices among retail sellers. The court concluded that the statute was entitled to a presumption of constitutionality and that the classification of the alcohol sellers for regulation did not violate any constitutional freedoms.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the claim and determined that the annexation was valid. On appeal, the court held that since the annexation affected appellant and its property was outside appellee's limits, the matter was of state concern and subject to the rules under Neb. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2 and Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14-117 (Reissue 1943). The court found that the state had provided for the annexation without a vote by the citizens, only requiring a vote to repeal or amend the annexation. The court ruled that the process of adopting a home charter rule was a local concern and could not bar appellee's annexation, which was a state concern. Because the circumstances surrounding the annexation were reasonable, appellee's annexation of appellant was valid, despite appellant being in the process of adopting a home charter rule.</SPAN></P>

The airport authority and the taxpayer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The airport authority contended that the annexation ordinance was unconstitutional because it impaired the airport authority's contracts. The airport authority argued that it was a separate public entity from the city and that the annexation statutes were not broad enough to include the airport authority. The court disagreed, holding that while the airport authority was a separate public corporation, it was also an agency of the city by which it was established. Accordingly, the court found that the metropolitan city, by virtue of annexation, succeeded to all rights and property of every kind, as well as all obligations of the annexed city. The court concluded that the existence of the airport authority had no effect on the annexation and did not impair the obligations and contracts of the airport authority. The court also upheld the trial court's order, which denied the taxpayer's intervention motion. The court held that when proper procedures were followed, taxpayers had no right to intervene in legal actions involved by annexation proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of the city and the order that denied intervention.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff purchaser brought a declaratory action against defendants, a credit company and a collection agency, alleging that a motor vehicle installment contract that was executed for his purchase of a house trailer was usurious. Under the parties' stipulation, the purchaser paid the balance due into court. The District Court for Scotts Bluff County (Nebraska) entered summary judgment for defendants, and the purchaser sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three years after the suit commenced, purchaser's wife filed a petition to intervene, claiming a one-half interest in the house trailer and that only a minor amount was due on the contract because of usury. On review, the court reversed, holding that the statute purporting to authorize the installment contract sued upon had been declared unconstitutional. The court found that the contract, which was usurious, was not void but that a recovery under the contract was limited to the amount of the principal without interest, less any interest paid, under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45-105 (Reissue 1943). Upon the filing of the wife's petition in intervention, all necessary persons were parties to the action and a declaratory judgment was within the power of the court to grant. Pursuant to Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-205 (Reissue 1943), the limitation for an action to enforce a contract entered into under a statute that had been held to be unconstitutional was one year from the effective date of the decision or of the statute. Although the wife's petition in intervention was not filed within such period, the commencement of the action by the purchaser inured to her benefit as intervenor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment for defendants and remanded the cause with direction to enter a declaratory judgment for the purchaser and the wife for the funds in the registry of the court in excess of the principal amount of the contract.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile court also overruled defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The delinquency petition alleged that defendant broke into and stole money from popcorn vending machines belonging to a vendor which were located in three different business establishments throughout a particular city. The evidence showed that defendant was in possession of a key which he had taken unlawfully. Two witnesses saw defendant in possession of the popcorn machine key and defendant conceded he threw the key in the trash can. Defendant was actually seen entering one of the popcorn machines. Defendant contended the evidence was insufficient to sustain the findings of the juvenile court and that it was error to deny him a jury trial. On appeal, the court held on trial de novo that the evidence fully sustained the finding of the juvenile court that defendant was a child in need of special supervision because he deported himself in a manner that could have injured or endangered seriously the morals or health of himself or others. Further, the juvenile court proceeding was a civil proceeding in which the constitutional guarantees of a jury trial were inapplicable under Nebraska law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the juvenile court.</SPAN></P>

Although 43 delay occurred before defendant's preliminary hearing was held, the trial court conducted the preliminary hearing two days after it was requested. Defendant appealed his conviction and contended that the delay in holding his preliminary hearing was a violation of his right to a speedy trial. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that defendant's constitutional rights to due process and a speedy trial were not violated. The court noted that there was no showing as to the reasons for the delay, nor that the delay was purposeful or oppressive. Thus, the court found that any prejudice that resulted from the delay in conducting the preliminary hearing was insubstantial and speculative.</SPAN></P>

The business argued that the statutes authorizing the annexation were unconstitutional and void and sought to enjoin the county from assessing, levying, or collecting taxes or acting in any manner purportedly granted by its annexation. The trial court denied the injunction action. The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-117 (Supp. 1967) was not violative of the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The court did not find that the words &quot;as are urban and suburban in character&quot; as used &sect; 16-117 were vague or indefinite. The words had plain meanings. The court also did not find Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-120 (Supp. 1967) to be unconstitutional. The court held that on annexation, the city was required to furnish benefits as soon as practicable but within a year. If the city failed in this respect business's remedy lay elsewhere than in a declaration of unconstitutionality of the authorizing statute. There was no want of due process or inequality of benefits in the legal sense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska), where they were convicted of forcibly assaulting or resisting a law enforcement officer while engaged in the performance of his official duty and while in the commission of said act of using a deadly or dangerous weapon in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 28-729 and 28-729.01 (1967).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain their convictions and a variety of other matters. The events that gave rise to these charges occurred when defendants were present in a courtroom for a preliminary hearing on other charges. After being remanded to custody, a struggle ensued when defendants resisted being handcuffed and taken away. At various times during the struggle, both defendants attempted to gain possession of a police officer's weapon. The court affirmed the convictions, finding that the fact that officers prevented defendants from gaining complete control of a weapon did not constitute a defense to the charge of assault while using a deadly weapon. The court also held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The terms &quot;use&quot; and &quot;forcibly resist&quot; were words of common usage. The statute was not required to define those terms, nor was the trial court required to define them in a jury instruction. On an evidentiary issue, the trial court properly excluded evidence concerning the validity of the charges that initially brought defendants to court, because it was not relevant to the circumstances of the assault.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions and sentences of defendants by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandamus requiring respondent to accept and file the petition. On respondent's appeal, the court held that where the circulator of an initiative petition had signed and sworn to a properly executed statutory form of affidavit that he or she was a legal and qualified voter of the State of Nebraska, there was a presumption that he or she was a qualified elector in the absence of affirmative evidence to the contrary. This presumption did not disappear simply because he or she had not signed his or her full Christian name. Respondent conceded that 755 of the signatures were otherwise valid but contended that they should be invalidated on a vague presumption that the sworn affidavit of the circulator was false. The court held that there was no justifiable reason to disfranchise electors in the exercise of their constitutionally reserved right of the initiative on such grounds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the Attorney General of Nebraska, brought an original action in the court against defendants, the Nebraska Clean Waters Commission and its members, alleging that the 1967 Nebraska Clean Waters Commission Act was invalid under Neb.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 1967 Nebraska Clean Waters Commission Act (Act) created the commission to assist municipalities in planning and financing waste water treatment works and solid waste disposal facilities. The commission was authorized to issue bonds and to loan money to municipalities. The court sustained the attorney general's motion. The court held that the Act violated the constitutional limitations upon the indebtedness of the State under Neb. Const. art.

The court stated that Nebraska's statutes comported with federal due process requirements and in fact were more specific than required by United States Supreme Court decisional law. The court suggested that forced sterilization was not cruel and inhuman punishment because numerous states had adopted sterilization as a means of reducing the number of criminals to execute and imbeciles to feed. The court said it did not matter that there was no evidence that the patient's children would be mentally feeble, as the statute did not list such a pre-condition to sterilization and because many states sterilized habitual criminals. The court noted that the patient had a low IQ, was a behavioral problem, had many illegitimate children, was fertile, and wanted more children. Besides, the court concluded, the patient could choose to stay in the State Home indefinitely if she did not want to be sterilized.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded. The court noted that the right to have children was a natural and constitutional right, and that no citizen had any rights superior to the common welfare. The court determined that the sterilization statutes were not unconstitutional as class legislation or as denying equal protection of the law under the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case. The court pointed out that the sterilization statute was compulsory only when required before release from the state home. The court found the statute reasonable as an exercise of the police power. Limiting its holding to the facts of the case and the statute before it, the court held that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 83-501 to 83-508 (1943) were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a contractor, challenged an order of the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska) that denied its writ of habeas corpus to test the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 52-119 (1943). The contractor was charged by appellee sheriff with violating the statute by entering into a building contract and having received the full price, failing to apply the money to the claims of materialmen for their lienable materialmen's claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The statute provided that it was unlawful for any person who had a building contract and received payments to fail to apply the money so received in payment of the lawful claims of the materialmen unless the person received and delivered to the owner of the property a written waiver of lien from all person who otherwise would have a right to file a lien. The court reasoned that any legislation that made it a crime for a person to use his own money for any purpose other than the payment of his debts violated his constitutional rights, which prohibited imprisonment for debt except in cases of fraud. The right of contract could only be limited by a general exercise of the police power and the payment of debts due materialmen was not calculated to conserve the safety, health, or general welfare of the community. In a case of first impression, the court found that the statute was unconstitutional because it failed to require a finding of fraud and permitted a prosecution for a criminal offense for the failure to pay a contractual obligation with proof of fraud. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. It held that a writ of habeas corpus should have been granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska), which convicted him of the assault of a guard pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-411(2) (Reissue 1943).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was an inmate at a correctional institution and was convicted for assaulting a guard. Section 28-411(2) provided that a person was guilty if he unlawfully assaulted or threatened another in a menacing manner or unlawfully struck or wounded another. Defendant contended on appeal that the word &quot;another&quot; meant another inmate, not another person. On appeal, the court held that the word &quot;another&quot; as used in &sect; 28-411(2) meant another person. The word &quot;another&quot; as used in &sect; 28-411(1) had long meant another person. That being true, it was presumed that the legislature intended to adopt the same meaning in &sect; 28-411(2) when it was enacted. The court further found that &sect; 28-411(2) was not invalid pursuant to the rule of strict construction of a penal statute.&nbsp;Section 28-411(2) was clear and unambiguous and subject to only one interpretation. Regarding defendant's argument that &sect; 28-411(2) was unconstitutional under Neb. Const. art. 3, &sect; 14, it was not necessary for the title to analyze the bill in detail and it was not necessary that the title inform readers of the specific contents of the bill. Section 28-411(2) was an amendatory act and the title clearly expressed its purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners sought to enjoin a city from proceeding in eminent domain to take restrictive easements over their lands to supply water to appellee corporations. The trial court refused to issue the requested injunction, but the court reversed this decision and temporarily enjoined the city from proceeding in eminent domain. Also, the court remanded the matter for further proceedings to determine the extent to which the taking was for the benefit of the city and its inhabitants. The power of eminent domain must have been for a public use only. The court held that a city engaging in the production of water was bound under the rules applicable to a private corporation and was required to supply water equally to all of its citizens. A city could sell water outside of its corporate limits under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 19-2701 (1943), but this was a permissive power. Thus, the court held that in order to proceed with eminent domain, the city needed to prove that its actions were for a public use, which was not identical to the public interest. Where a condemnation proceeding purported to take property for a public and substantial private use, the condemnation was required to have been denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city had passed an ordinance which had the effect of annexing the property owners' property to the city. The property owners sought to enjoin the assessment and levy of municipal taxes by the city upon their property. The trial court denied the injunction and the property owners appealed. In reversing, the court held that 1963 Neb. Laws 338 was unconstitutional in that it was inhibited by Neb. Const. art. 11, &sect; 1. Because the property owners' action was an action to enjoin the collection of municipal taxes levied on their property, and the statute under which the property was annexed to the city was unconstitutional, the municipal taxes levied pursuant to such void annexation were likewise void. Therefore, because injunction was a proper remedy, the trial court erred in denying equitable relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landlord sought review of a judgment of the District Court of Lancaster County (Nebraska), entering a declaratory judgment that quieted title in plaintiff outgoing tenants in various structures and improvements that they made upon the landlord's property and in favor of the landlord in regard to various other aspects of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landlord took steps to sell school land that was occupied by the outgoing tenants under a lease that was about to an expire. The controversy centered around the form of a disputed title to permanent improvements on the land. The trial court entered a declaratory judgment that quieted title in the tenants as to a stock well, various structures and a growing crop, and the landlord as to loading chutes, corrals, a board windbreak, and land leveling. The court held that the tenants had a property interest in all the improvements except the development by land leveling. The tenants' rights in the improvements consisted of either a common law privilege of removal or a right to compensation. The court then proceeded to state that the privilege of removal was inadequate and that for land leveling and well holes, it was completely unavailing. In effect, the tenant departed empty handed. Therefore, the court reversed and remanded the case with directions for the trial court to enter a judgment which declared that the tenants had a compensable interest that resulted from the improvements, except the land leveling. The value of the tenants' interest was determined prior to the sale.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was reversed and remanded with directions which declared that the outgoing tenants had a compensable interest that resulted from the improvements that were made upon the landlord's property, except the land leveling, and that the value of their interest required a determination prior to sale. The costs of the litigation were assessed to the landlord. In all other respects, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
