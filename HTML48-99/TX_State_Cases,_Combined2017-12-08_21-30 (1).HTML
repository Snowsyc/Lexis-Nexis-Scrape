The trial court rendered judgment in favor of defendant lender for the full amount of the note less unearned interest. Plaintiff appealed. Without violation of usury laws, a lender could require a borrower to secure additional insurance as security as long as the borrower was allowed to contract for the additional insurance with a company of his choice. A collateral transaction that allowed the lender to make a profit would not render the loan usurious when such transaction was entered into in good faith and without usurious intent. Because defendant lender did not require plaintiff to purchase the additional insurance through defendant lender and because the transaction appeared to be in good faith, the judgment was reformed and affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer filed suit in the County Court of Galveston County (Texas) seeking review of the order of appellee, the Texas Employment Commission, granting unemployment benefits to appellee employee under the Texas Unemployment Compensation Act, at Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 5221b-4. The trial court declared that the statute was constitutional and held that the employee was not unemployed as defined in the Act. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee left his employment to seek work elsewhere and to obtain his retirement contributions. The issues on appeal were whether the employee was unemployed after he left the company as contemplated by the Act and whether the double affirmation provision of art. 5221b-4 (b) was constitutional. The statute provided that benefits were to be paid to an employee pending an employer's appeal of an affirmative decision for the employee by the Commission. The employer had alleged that the Commission could not legally pay such benefits pending the resolution of an appeal from the Commission's decision. The court affirmed the trial court's finding that art. 5221b-4 was constitutional. The statute did not deny the employer's right to a supersedeas bond; the employer had not requested such a bond. Next, the court held that the evidence did not support the trial court's finding that the employee was not unemployed under the Act after he left his job and that he was disqualified for benefits. The Commission's administrative decision in favor of the employee had been supported by substantial evidence, and the trial court erred in overturning the Commission's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's finding that the &quot;double affirmation&quot; provision of the Texas Unemployment Compensation Act was constitutional. The court reversed the finding that the employee was not unemployed during the period of time that he performed no services for the employer and received no wages from it. The judgment was rendered in part.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant judgment debtor challenged the judgment of the District Court of Cameron County (Texas), which awarded a judgment to appellee judgment creditor in the creditor's enforcement of a California judgment, on the grounds that the California judgment was void for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtor's defense to the enforcement of the California judgment was essentially that the California court never had jurisdiction over him due lack of proper service and the like and that, therefore, the foreign judgment was void. On review, the court held that if an authenticated copy of a foreign judgment appeared on its face to be of a court of general jurisdiction and valid, the forum court had to presume that the foreign court obtained jurisdiction over the cause and the parties. The burden to prove otherwise fell in this case to the debtor. In addition, no collateral attack could be permitted unless the debtor clearly proved that the foreign court never had jurisdiction over him. The court held that the evidence presented at the trial failed to overcome that presumption. Neither did it matter that the foreign judgment was in fact an amended judgment, nunc pro tunc to the original decree; the amendment was only to correct clerical or scrivener errors. Nor did the court bother to examine the debtor's constitutional challenge to the judgment as it was based on purely hypothetical facts not before the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff magazine salesman appealed the decision from a Texas trial court, which entered judgment for defendants, the City of El Paso, its mayor, and the police chief, in the magazine salesman's suit for injunctive relief challenging the enforcement of El Paso, Tex., Ordinance 500 regulating the solicitation of orders or subscriptions for publications in a certain area of the City.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The magazine salesman operated a crew that went from state to state procuring subscriptions. The magazine salesman attacked the constitutionality of the ordinance, contending largely that it created an arbitration classification in violation of the equal protection clause. In particular, the magazine salesman argued that the ordinance did not regulate other types of solicitation. On appeal, the court favored defendants. The ordinance passed constitutional muster because it was a reasonable regulation to control traffic on business streets. For that reason, the ordinance was not an arbitrary classification. The City had the police power to regulate the streets, and even when the regulation created some classification, the classification was not unconstitutional unless arbitrary. Moreover, defendants showed that the solicitation did cause disruptions and traffic issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 1824, compelling respondent, the district judge, to set his cause of action for trial. Relator had instituted suit against respondent alleged tortfeasors in the District Court of Bexar County (Texas), charging them with causing an explosion resulting in damages in relator's home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing in which the trial court ordered relator to complete a deposition, the trial judge removed the case from the settings. Relator declined to answer the questions propounded to him by the alleged tortfeasors. The court concluded that the most relator presented was a dogmatic refusal to obey the trial court's order without any statement of reason. Relator, in the course of examination, simply refused to give testimony. The court stated that it would not presume that the trial court unconscionably entered a void order. The court held that relator fell far short of his burden to show that the trial court entered a void rather than an erroneous order. Further, the court held that the trial judge had not usurped his powers by demanding obedience to his lawful order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant real estate broker sought review of an order of the District Court of Uvalde County, 38th Judicial District (Texas), which overruled his plea of privilege to be sued in Bexar County, the county of his residence. Appellee property owner, in his breach of contract action, sought to maintain venue in Uvalde County, under Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1995, &sect; 7, because of alleged fraud committed in Uvalde County.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties had an agreement where the broker was to find buyers for his and the owner's adjoining land. The broker argued there was no evidence that he made any fraudulent promises, no evidence of any intention not to perform any promises that were made at the time they were made, if they were made, and no evidence that the owner was damaged by the failure to perform any promises that were made, if they were made. In affirming, the court held that all the circumstances surrounding the transaction were sufficient to support an implied finding of fraudulent intent. Very slight circumstantial evidence of fraud, when considered with the breach of promise to perform some act in the future, was sufficient to support a finding of fraudulent intent in transactions within the purview of the Statute of Frauds. The court noted that it was not necessary in the venue hearing that the owner establish the exact amount of the damages he suffered because of the fraud. The court concluded that the broker's own testimony was sufficient to support an implied finding that the owner suffered some damage because of the broker's failure to perform his promise to sell the land for a contemplated townsite.</SPAN></P>

However, the trial court made factual findings that the chauffeur was convicted of driving under the influence, and driving under a suspended license, and found that the chauffeur's license was suspended as a result of the convictions. The chauffeur appealed, claiming that his prior offenses were not proven in the trial court. The court found that the pleadings and the chauffeur's testimony provided sufficient evidence of each of the chauffeur's convictions. Upon each of the convictions, the questions of the suspension of the chauffeur's license were a matter to have been determined by the law applicable to each conviction. The chauffeur's license was automatically suspended upon his convictions. The chauffeur was provided due course of the law because he was given an opportunity to have been heard on the charges from which the suspension stemmed.</SPAN></P>

The writ commanded the City officials to pass an ordinance revoking a public housing cooperation agreement that the City had entered into or to submit such an ordinance to a public election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the City entered into the cooperation agreement, the residents filed a petition, signed by the number of signatories required by the Galveston, Tex.

The trial court found that the residents had presented the required number of signatures and that the City must pass the ordinance or hold an election. Reversing, the court found in favor of appellants. The court determined that the trial court, before granting the drastic remedy of mandamus, had to preserve and enforce the reservations of power for the procedures of initiative and referendum. The court noted that the effect of the ordinance would actually be a referendum revoking the City's cooperation agreement, thereby impairing its obligations of an existing contract. The court concluded that the Texas Legislature had already granted the City the right to decide to enter cooperation agreements and, therefore, the writ of mandamus could not be made to extend the City's powers beyond those granted by the state housing laws or the City's Charter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers claimed that the bond proceeds were to have been used to build a gymnasium, which was an illegal expenditure. In considering their appeal, the court concluded that the trial court properly sustained the trustees' special exceptions. The court ruled that under Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3 and Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2784e, school districts were authorized to use the proceeds from bonds voted by the qualified electors of the district to erect a gymnasium. Additionally, the court ruled that under Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3, school districts had a right to levy taxes for the purpose of erecting school buildings, and a gymnasium was a school building. Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2663a required the teaching of physical education in public schools, and a gymnasium was necessary for that task. The court ruled, therefore, that the trustees were justified in using a portion of the bond proceeds to erect a gymnasium. Nothing in Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2802e-1 indicated that it provided the exclusive method of securing funds to build a gymnasium, and the provisions of that statute were merely cumulative of those in Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2784e and Tex. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

The 58th Judicial District Court of Jefferson County (Texas) permanently enjoined the City from enforcing Port Arthur, Tex., Ordinances Nos. 1354 and 1355 against either producer or other producers similarly situated. The City appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">One of the producers operated its dairy in another city and sold milk within the boundaries of the City. The other producer sold its milk to the first producer and neither directly sold nor intended to directly sell its milk in the City. Both producers' dairies were inspected by a city health official in that other city and were permitted by that other city. By Port Arthur, Tex., Ordinances Nos. 1354 and 1355, the producers were required to pay inspection fees and to pay annual permit fees to the City as a prerequisite to obtaining a permit to sell milk there. The first producer refused to pay the permit fee, but intended to continue selling its milk in the City. The City's health officer stated that he intended to cancel the producer's permit and pursue criminal action against that producer. The court held that Port Arthur, Tex., Ordinances Nos. 1354 and 1355 were null and void because they sought to extend the authority of the city's health officer into the borders of another city that had enacted milk ordinances that were in harmony with the specifications and regulations promulgated by the State Health Officer of Texas under the authority of Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. &sect; 165-3.</SPAN></P>

The fireman petitioned for a writ of mandamus. The trial court granted the writ. The city appealed. The court affirmed. The proposed ordinance was subject to the initiative and referendum provision of the charter because the fixing of salaries was also lawmaking power. Because it was a legislative power to create an office and prescribe its duties, the fixing of emoluments was also a legislative power. Even if the ordinance was invalid, the court was without power to interfere in the election or to rule on the ordinance until enforcement was sought in the courts because such interference would have permitted the abridgement of the political power of the people and violated the separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board alleged that appellees were not entitled to additional prior service credit and that S.B. 438 was constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The purpose of S.B. 438 was to merge the teacher and state employee retirement systems insofar as prior service and creditable service, but it required at least 20 years of joint creditable service to be eligible for retirement. The teacher who became an assistant attorney general was not entitled to the credit because he did not serve 20 years with the school system. The state employee was not entitled to credit for six years as a teacher because the S.B. 438 provisions authorizing the credit were unconstitutional. S.B. 438, &sect; 5 was unconstitutional because it provided for a teacher to be eligible for and receive benefits from two retirement system funds. Two constitutional amendments, Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 48a (1936), and Tex. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 62(a) (1946), provided that recipients of the teacher and state employee retirement funds were not eligible for any other pension retirement funds. Without &sect; 5, the purpose of the act could not be fulfilled, and, therefore, the entire act was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county judge was defeated in a primary election and applied to the county commissioners for additional payment for the seven prior years he had served on the juvenile board; the payment was approved by two commissioners just two days before they left office, and the county clerk issued checks to the judge in satisfaction of the district court judgment. The county then claimed that the payment was unauthorized and based upon an unconstitutional law. On review, the court found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3912e-5 did not specify when the order of a county commissioner's court for payment of a county judge should be made, that the commissioners did not act wrongfully because they were a quorum and had power to approve payment, that the acceptance of the district court judgment was not evidence of bad faith by the commissioners because that court had authority, and that the county was not required to appeal that judgment. The court noted that a county had the right to waive the two-year statute of limitations for the judge's action and found that art. 3912e-5 did not violate Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 56's prohibition against local laws regulating the affairs of counties.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the action of the company in participating in the hearing regarding the order, amounted to a waiver of the limitations in the notice. The making of no objections to the form of the notice or of the proceedings pursuant thereto, amounted to a waiver and voluntary appearance for all purposes. Finally, the court held that the company did not satisfy its burden of proving the invalidity of the order cancelling the certificate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees in seeking to uphold the trial court's decision that the statute was unconstitutional argued that the power of the legislature to enact a statute like art. 6243i was taken away by constitutional amendments, Tex.

The court rejected the contention that the two amendments, taken together, constituted such a complete whole that they necessarily gave rise to the implication that it was intended to forbid thereafter the creation of any municipal pension systems except in the manner authorized by the two amendments. There was no express language in the amendments declaring whether or not, or in what manner, the legislature could by general law create systems for the individual cities. Thus, the court held that the amendments did not, expressly or by implication, relate to the kind of law involved in this case. Moreover, the court held that the legislature was not without authority to compel a transfer of the fund from the trustees who had been in possession of it to the trustees named by Tex. Civ. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The members claimed that the assessment imposed on them was improper and that the use made of the funds by the officials was improper and justified repayment of the assessments. The trial court ruled for the members, and the officials appealed. Noting that funds collected by the officials under the aegis of Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 3108 were trust funds, the court agreed with the trial court that certain disbursements, including those for the county chairman's salary, were expressly banned. Moreover, while the members stipulated to the use of the funds, that stipulation was made part of the statutory application for ballot placement, was not optional, and resulted in an exaction, not a contract, that was unenforceable. The court thereupon reviewed various items that the trial court had already concluded were improperly paid and further refined the disqualifications based on additional factors, such as the date on which the expense was incurred, and whether the underlying activity was required by law. Finding that the amount for which the officials should be held accountable was $ 1,212, the court reduced the judgment accordingly and affirmed the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an election, a county judge declared the city incorporated. In seeking to prevent the city's imposition of certain taxes, the taxpayers claimed that the city's incorporation was invalid because the boundaries included more than two square miles and the city had a population of 2000 or less inhabitants in violation of 1925 Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 971 and because the city's incorporated area included pastoral and agricultural lands in excess of that necessary for the occupancy of its citizens and the city's reasonable expansion in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 1134. The district court held that the defects in the city's incorporation were cured by Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 973a, which permitted the incorporation of a city of 2000 or less inhabitants in an area greater than two square miles. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment against the taxpayers and remanded their cause for trial by finding that the taxpayers properly alleged a violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 1134 by raising a factual question to be determined by the district court as to whether the alleged excess territory included in the city's boundaries was intended for strictly town purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were married in Dallas County, Texas, and their domicile and residence was in that county until they moved with their daughter to another county to be near the wife's ill mother. The wife filed a divorce suit against the husband in Dallas County. The husband failed to appear and the trial court entered a judgment for the wife and denied the husband's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that whether the wife's permanent residence was in Dallas County for six months before the filing of the suit, as required, was a question of fact, and the evidence was sufficient to sustain the trial court's findings that her permanent residence was in Dallas County for the required time. The court also held that the 44th District Court was the designated Juvenile Court of Dallas County and therefore the cause was properly before it. The court concluded that there was no irregularity in the trial court's hearing of the case without a previous setting because no written answer was on file, citation was regular and properly served by a qualified officer, and had been on file as required.</SPAN></P>

The county judge refused appellants' petition, which was filed on the same day as the passing of the Board's order. On review, appellants asserted that consolidation was void because the consent of the other school district was not obtained, the Board's order was arbitrary and unreasonable, and the Board's action constituted an abuse of discretion. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that under Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2922-18 (Vernon 1949), the Board had the authority to consolidate each dormant school district and the consent of the adjoining school district was not required. The court determined that the legislature, in making consolidation mandatory in such circumstances, did not intend that the authority of the Board would be dependent on the consent of other affected counties. The evidence also failed to show bad faith, abuse of discretion, fraud or undue influence, and thus interference with the discretionary power of the Board by the court under the facts was not authorized. The court noted that the order was only applicable to land lying in the county.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7426-7447, conspiracies against trade, and the Texas Constitution, to recover penalties authorized by Tex. Rev. Stat. Civ. Ann. tit. 126, art. 7436 (1925).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the institution of the antitrust lawsuit, the gas company sought to assert its privilege to be sued in the place of its domicile. On appeal, the gas company argued that the nature of the lawsuit was not such as to maintain venue in the challenged county against its plea of privilege, that because the relief sought recovery of statutory penalties under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7436 (1925) and an injunction under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 725 (1925), the State could not arbitrarily select the forum outside of the county of the gas company's residence, and that no part of the cause of action occurred in the challenged county. In affirming the judgment below, the court held that art. 7436 controlled the venue in the case and provided that the State could institute suit in any county within Texas. Article 7436 further expressly granted venue to such district courts and precluded transfer except upon a change of venue as allowed by the trial court. Thus, the plea of privilege could not be asserted in such cases. Further, art. 7436 was constitutional and the doctrine of forum non conveniens was inapplicable because the discretion as to the forum was vested in the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured brought an action against the board to compel cancellation of an order adopted by the board, which prohibited any insurance company from insuring the first $ 100 of loss resulting from windstorm, hurricane or hail. The trial judge found the order was adopted by the board without statutory authority and rendered a judgment to vacate and annul the order. The board appealed from the decision. The court stated that the evidence was sufficient to show that the order was not so unreasonable as to be invalid. The insured was deprived of the right to insure his property against storm damage to the extent of the first $ 100 of his loss. However, the court stated that although that fact was regrettable, to give the insured the privilege would increase the cost of storm insurance so as to make it prohibitive. Thus, based on public policy, the court stated that if the insurance company had to pay, without restriction, the cost of administering the insurance would have been so great as to defeat its purpose.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and dissolved the temporary injunction awarded therein. The court held that the trial court erred in finding that a &quot;labor dispute&quot; did not exist. The court noted that whether a majority of the employees were engaged in the controversy was not a factor in determining what constituted a &quot;labor dispute.&quot; The court rejected the employer's contention that the picket line was invalid on grounds that the National Labor Relations Board had not certified the union as appellants' bargaining agent. Regarding the nature of the picketing, the court disagreed with the trial court's finding that it was threatening and coercive. Rather, the court concluded that the picketing was carried on in a peaceful manner. The employer admitted that mass picketing was not involved and there was no evidence that any member of the picket line obstructed any ingress or egress from the terminal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that the amendatory ordinance was null and void because there was no substantial evidence to justify the change in zoning purposes or uses of the block in question.

Defendants, however, argued that the ordinance was an exercise of police power by the municipality in its governmental capacity. The court held that: (1) the city acquired the power to enact zoning laws from Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 1011a to 1011j; (2) under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.

The trial court also denied the city any recovery in a cross-action to recover a sum allegedly due under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bus lines company operated buses and street cars inside and beyond the city's limits. The city sought to recover fees due under an ordinance, which provided all sums collected by a public utility within the city's limits, that were in excess of a fair return on investment, were held in trust for the city. The trial court ruled the ordinance was void as applied to the bus lines company and enjoined the city from attempting to enforce the ordinance against the bus lines company. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court stated that the city did not have a legal or equitable title to the funds. The court ruled that the city failed to establish the power delegated to the city to impose a duty on the bus lines company to keep account of all its passengers and the amounts due each. The court further ruled that the state law delegating power to regulate rates required that the rates be certain and definite to constitute a valid exercise of power. The court stated the rates were indefinite and confiscatory, and the rates were improperly applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1269k, &sect; 7, the mayor removed the former commissioners (commissioners) from their official offices based upon inefficiency and neglect of duty. The commissioners filed an action that sought a temporary restraining order to prevent the mayor from taking any further action to remove them from office. The lower court granted the temporary restraining order. The court reversed. The court rejected the commissioners' argument that the statute was unconstitutional because it did not provide for a judicial review and gave the mayor the sole and exclusive right to initiate their ouster. The court held that regardless of whether the statute provided for judicial review, an appeal was allowed. However, the court held that the right to a judicial review did not entitle the commissioners to a temporary injunction, which would perpetuate them in office pending review. The court held that the mayor had jurisdiction under the statute to oust the commissioners from office. The court held that the mayor's order was presumed to be correct and had to be given effect until the contrary was shown.</SPAN></P>

The operator alleged that a certain ordinance of the city regulating taxicabs was invalid as a whole and as to each section thereof in that it contravened the terms of both the State and Federal Constitutions and he sought a judgment to that effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The operator also sought a judgment declaring unconstitutional Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6698. Lastly, the operator sought to have the trial court issue its writ of injunction to restrain the enforcement of the ordinance. The court stated that the operator was in the business of operating taxicabs when the ordinance was passed, that he desired to continue such service; that he operated 20 taxicabs, 2 airport buses, and 1 railroad bus, and that he maintained a 24-hour service as to his taxicab business. Under the provisions of Waco, Tex., Ordinance &sect;&sect; 5, 6, the operator could not put his taxicabs on the streets in the pursuit of his business unless the drivers obtained a chauffeur's license under &sect;&sect; 5, 6. Each driver's failure to obtain a chauffeur's license from the city would subject him to arrest and would interfere with the operator in the operation of his business. Assuming that the operator complied with all the provisions of the ordinance, except &sect;&sect; 5, 6, he had a right to pursue his business without having the drivers interfered with by the city. The pleadings and the evidence were ample to tender the issue that the operator did have a justiciable interest in the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The resident lived in Zavala County, Texas, which was one of the three counties in the junior college's district.

The junior college intervened in the resident's action against the Assessor-Collector. The trial court found that a prior quo warranto action regarding the validity of the junior college's formation and the authority to levy and assess taxes was void and was not res judicata in the resident's action. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court to deny injunctive relief to the resident. The formation of the junior college was valid under art. 2815h, and was comprised of valid combination of contiguous counties under Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2815h, &sect; 17. The junior college possessed the authority to assess and collect taxes under Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2815h, &sect;&sect; 7a, 7b, 22.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The railroad company operated passenger trains between two communities that were 171 miles apart. The service consisted of one train each way daily between the two communities. It determined that the operation was not economically feasible, and under Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6479, it applied to the Commission for permission to discontinue the service. The Commission denied the application, and the trial court sustained the denial. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erroneously concluded that the Commission's decision was reasonably supported by substantial evidence, and it erred in holding that the railroad company failed to prove that continued operation was not economically feasible. There was ample proof that few people used the passenger trains for short trips. There was competition from improved bus service, and the expanded use of personal automobiles. The court rejected the Commission's contention that the decision would render art. 6479 invalid under Tex. Const. art. X, &sect; 2. It held that Tex. Civ. Stat.

Further, the court determined that the levy of a tax upon an occupation producing carbon black by the use of gas was in aid of regulation, and could be prohibited, if the legislature desired to so do. However, the court did not believe that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 7047(46) imposed the tax on every person or entity manufacturing or producing carbon black, except as therein provided.

They were not members of a labor union. The owner executed a contract with a county to dismantle and move two large airplane hangers and re-erect them at a second site. The union requested that the owner hire members of the local iron worker's union to perform the iron work on the project. The owner refused the request and used his own employees to perform the work, paying them wages that were lower than union wages. He eventually hired union carpenters and welders to perform parts of the project. The union established a picket in the street adjoining the site of the re-construction and cited the carpenters and welders, who, in turn, refused to perform any further work on the project. The court held that the union had violated art. 5154f by picketing a premises when there was no labor dispute between the owner and those picketing. Art. 5154f was constitutional and did not violate the union's constitutional rights because it only limited free speech where there was no direct controversy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company's truck had a van-trailer attached to it when the passengers' car collided with it. The truck was parked illegally in violation of Tyler, Tex., Ordinance to Regulate Traffic upon the Public Streets of Tyler (Aug. 6, 1943), art. 6, &sect; 24, which prohibited truck drivers from parking on public streets unless they were loading or unloading. The truck driver had stopped at a steak house for a cup of coffee. The company contended that violation of the ordinance did not constitute negligence per se because the ordinance was unreasonable, unauthorized, and unconstitutional. The court disagreed and upheld the judgment for the passengers. The court held that it was not only the right but the imperative duty of a city to make and enforce such regulations covering the use of its streets as would be for the convenience and protection of the public. The court concluded that the ordinance was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary and that it found direct support in the Texas Constitution and in the provisions of Texas statute.

The trial court entered judgments for the district, and the landowners appealed.

The court found that where the district had to contract and negotiate with the federal government and meet governmental requirements and regulations, the district's decision to take fee title in the property, rather than a mere easement, was a reasonable exercise of discretion and not the result of fraud or arbitrary action. The judgments were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, insurance commissioners and the attorney general, sought review of a judgment of the Dist. Court, Travis County, Fifty-Third District (Texas), which declared pursuant to appellee insurance company's petition, that the Board of Insurance Commissioners had the power under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4698a, to approve different rates for different insurers for the same risk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company had many years of experience selling the kinds of insurance covered by art. 4698a. The rates charged prior to the statute's enactment were not regulated by law. After the enactment, the Board of Insurance Commissioners fixed rates for all affected insurers, which were higher than the company had previously charged and higher than it desired to charge. The company sought a declaration that art. 4698a did not preclude the Board from allowing different insurers to charge different rates. The court stated that the statute, by its own terms, showed that uniform, as opposed to competitive, rates were contemplated by the Legislature. The court found that it was clearly the purpose of the Legislature in enacting art. 4698a to empower the Board to regulate rates charged for the types of insurance affected by the Act. The court construed the requirements of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 4698a., &sect;&sect; 2 and 7, that the rate-making standards were to have been measured by and fitted to a composite rate structure created by consideration of all relevant factors on an industry wide basis, within and without the State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and rendered judgment that the company take nothing by its suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurer sued respondents, the board of insurance commissioners and others, for a declaratory judgment that the board's order revoking approval of a contract between the insurer and its agent was improper. The insurer also sought in part a declaration that Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1302a, &sect; 11, was unconstitutional. The 98th District Court, Travis County (Texas) granted the insurer relief, and the board appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agent agreed to issue title insurance in the name of the insurer. The agent also agreed to pay for certain losses and claims on those policies. The board approved the contract and then issued an order revoking its approval on the ground that the agent was acting as a reinsurer without legal authorization in violation of Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1302a, &sect;&sect; 3, 11. Finding that the agent was not acting as a reinsurer, the trial court held that the board's order was null and void. The trial court further held that art. 1302a, &sect; 11, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the fact that the agent agreed to pay for certain losses or claims did not make the agent a reinsurer; instead, the agent was offering legal consideration for its promise to exercise due diligence on behalf of the insurer. Because the contract did not violate art. 1302a, the trial court erred in reaching the question of the constitutionality of art. 1302a.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reformed the judgment to eliminate findings that held the statute to be unconstitutional and affirmed the judgment as modified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, an oil company and other owners and operators of oil and gas leases, sought review of an order from the 126th District Court, Travis County (Texas), which was entered in favor of appellee State of Texas in the State's action seeking temporary and permanent writs of injunction against the oil company. The trial court granted a temporary injunction, which enjoined oil company from polluting the rivers and tributaries near their leases.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The temporary injunction was granted after a full hearing, and after its plea of privilege was overruled, but before the hearing on the application for temporary injunction, the oil company filed a supersedeas bond. At the hearing, oil company timely moved to stay pending the outcome of its venue appeal, which motion was overruled. Several other owners and operators assigned such as error, claiming that an order overruling a plea of privilege may be superseded and that upon the filing and approval of the supersedeas bond, the trial court was without power to grant a temporary injunction. The court rejected those arguments and held that the evidence supported the findings as to the harmful effect of a salt water intrusion into certain rivers and tributaries. The court determined that the oil company and others had no lawful right to discharge or cause the discharge of any salt water into public waters used for domestic purposes, and thus, the trial court's order was not too broad. The court concluded however, that the owners' and operators' challenge to the trial court's order overruling their pleas of privilege was well-taken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order granting a temporary injunction, but reversed the order overruling the owners' and operators' pleas of privilege and remanded the cause to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The officials challenged a judgment of the trial court (Texas), which decreed that the daughter and the children fell in Class A Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 7118 (Vernon 1935).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testator's wife executed an instrument adopting her sister's daughter. The instrument stated that the testator joined in its execution for the purpose of consenting to the adoption, but the adoption was the act only of the wife and did not affect the testator's estate. The wife died, and the testator died. The executor of the testator's will sought to determine the classification of the daughter and children. The trial court ruled that they fell in Class A. The court held that the trial court correctly placed the daughter in Class A, but her children fell in Class E, Tex. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 7122. The daughter was included in Class A independently of the adoption law of 1931, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 46a, &sect; 9 (Vernon 1931). But for the change made in the adoption laws of 1931, the bequests to the children were taxable at the rates argued by the officials. The language of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 7118 (Vernon 1935) was plain and unambiguous and excluded the children of an adopted child of the testator's wife. Under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 46a, &sect; 9 (Vernon 1931), the children were not entitled to be in Class A as direct lineal descendants of the wife.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment as to the daughter's classification. The court reversed the judgment as to the children's classification and declared that they fell in Class E.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city appealed a decision of the 103rd District Court, Cameron County (Texas), which entered judgment in favor of defendants, a water district and class representatives, in a declaratory judgment action over the validity of election proceedings and requirements pursuant to Brownsville, Tex., Ordinance No. 281 and Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1182a, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city enacted Ordinance No. 281 to annex land adjacent to the city and lying in the water district. Each year the city levied ad valorem taxes against the property in the annexed territory and the water district also levied ad valorem taxes and assessments against it. For the first few years, the city collected the tax for it and for the district and then turned over the portion belonging to the district, but it eventually collected and retained only its own tax. As a result, confusion arose when some land owners paid both taxes and some did not. The city filed an action seeking a declaration that the election proceedings and requirements were invalid. The trial court found the statutes valid, and the city appealed. The court reversed, holding that the statute and ordinance were invalid and in conflict with the Constitution. One municipality could not take, damage, or destroy the property of another municipality except through due process and with adequate compensation, but the city did not take any property belonging to the district. The annexed territory was still in the district and subject to the same district taxes as it was before it was annexed.</SPAN></P>

Intervenors originally purchased the homes in reliance upon the residential restrictions contained in the ordinance the owners were attacking. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing them to intervene in the action. The owners alleged the ordinance did not apply to them because their land was in a de facto business area and they could not now use their properties for the residential purposes for which they had been brought. They based their arguments on the fact that the property across the street from their lots was unrestricted. Upon review, the court found that the ordinance was in all respects legal and valid. The court observed that 13 of the owners' properties were being used for residences. The court found that the owners bought their land with notice that it was residentially zoned, but they had to have reasonably contemplated that the area across the street under the control of another city might develop into a business district.</SPAN></P>

The company and its related parties stated that because the 1946 taxes were involved in a bona fide lawsuit, they were not delinquent. Because the taxes in question were not fully paid by the company and its related parties, the city refused to give them the discount for the ad valorem taxes that they had previously paid. Subsequently, the trial court awarded the company and its related parties a discount of three percent of the amount of ad valorem taxes due them to the city for the year 1947. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the provision of the city's ordinance which provided that the tax discount would not be allowed if there were delinquent taxes against the same property was void because it violated Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 55 (1932).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs contended that the amendatory act, Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. arts. 2757, 2758, as amended by Tex. Gen. Laws ch. 238, was void and unconstitutional in that the caption of the act was misleading and violated Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35 and that it had been in part repealed. The court did not agree. The court found that to hold that arts. 2757, 2758 were repealed to the extent mentioned would be to favor repeal by implication, which was never to be done where the acts could be harmonized and effect given to each. It was clear that a common school district having less than 700 inhabitants could not be converted into an independent school district, under arts. 2757, 2758, but if such district maintained a first-class high school of 12 grades, offering 16 or more credits, then it might be incorporated into an independent school district under the provisions of Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2742j. In addition, all that was required of a caption to an act was that it state the general purpose in order to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 2524-1, to test the constitutionality of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1269m (1947). The city contended that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1269m (1947) was an invasion of the right of the cities to adopt and amend their charters under the Home Rule Amendment to the Tex. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5. The trial court found all but Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1269m, &sect; 18 (1947) to be constitutional and valid. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the provisions of the city's charter pertaining to the police and fire departments would not have been valid if in conflict with general laws of the State because charter provisions and city ordinances of home-rule cities were not valid when in conflict with the general laws of the State. The court further held that &sect; 18 was invalid in that it permitted reviewing courts to substitute its discretion for that of the administrative officials of the city and thereby imposed upon reviewing courts administrative as distinguished from judicial functions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtors were deeded lots from the same grantor. The tax collector for a school district executed upon the lots for unpaid real estate taxes. The lots were sold to an individual at a summary sale and were resold to the buyers. The debtors brought an unsuccessful action for title and possession of the improved lots and appealed. The court reversed the trial court. The court found that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art.7328a (1929) was constitutional and that it did not provide for summary sale of property to recover delinquent real estate tax. Article 7328a repealed the power of the tax collector to conduct such summary sales, the court said, and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 7272 (amended 1931) did not reinstate that power. Although art. 7272 permitted the tax collector to levy real estate taxes, the definition and scope of &quot;levy&quot; did not include the authority to sell, the court determined. Although Tex. Const. art. 8, &sect;&sect; 13, 15 permitted the legislature to pass legislation authorizing the tax collector to conduct summary sales, the legislature had not promulgated such a statute when the tax collector conducted his summary sale.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer sought review of a final order of a trial court (Texas), which dissolved a temporary injunction and denied the taxpayer any relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer duly rendered his property for taxation in December 1946. Prior to March 1947, he was sent and received notices that changes (increases) in the assessed valuation of his property had been recommended and would be adopted unless written protest was received by the board of equalization. The notices were ignored by the taxpayer. The taxpayer failed to file a protest with or to appear before the board, although the board was in session for the purpose of hearing taxpayers' complaints at the time of trial. On appeal, the taxpayer argued that the tax assessment provisions of the city's charter were unconstitutionally invalid because they were inconsistent with the general taxing provision contained in Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1053. On appeal, the court disagreed, finding that the fallacy of the taxpayer's argument was obvious. The court reasoned that a law might have been general although it did not include or embrace all the subjects with which it dealt. The court held that the City of Austin, as a home rule city, was expressly given the power to provide for and regulate its tax affairs by Tex. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1175, &sect;&sect; 7, 8 and 9.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants alleged that they had a right to picket the premises because a labor dispute existed, and the picketing was a privileged exercise of free speech.

He further alleged that the National Labor Relations Board had denied appellants permission to hold a union election, and that their placards displayed untrue defamatory statements. Affirming, the court noted that because findings of fact or law were not requested or filed, it had to presume that the trial court's judgment was grounded on the necessary findings, which could be inferred from the record. Pursuant to the record, appellants did not comply with the rules of law that permitted peaceful picketing, including the use of truthful placards. Also, due to the lack of a supporting factual basis, appellants had not been shown to have been aggrieved by the claimed unconstitutionally of Tex. Rev. Civ.

The court further found that, in order to obtain the equitable relief that it sought, appellant was required to return, or offer to return, the benefits that had accrued to it under this transaction, including the substantial profits that appellant realized from the operation of the distribution system. However, the court found that appellant's complaint and the evidence were insufficient to show an offer and the ability to restore the status quo, and that appellant could not reject the disadvantageous part of this transaction while still accepting its benefits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner applied for a permit to construct a house in a &quot;B&quot; residence district with a floor space of 752 square feet. The city denied his application pursuant to &sect; 6.05c, which provided for a minimum floor area of 900 square feet in &quot;B&quot; districts. The property owner sought to enjoin enforcement of &sect; 6.05c on the ground that it was unconstitutional and void. The trial court entered a judgment for the city and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 6.05c, as an exercise of municipal discretion, was presumed valid and that the property owner failed to discharge his heavy burden to rebut the presumption by showing that &sect; 6.05c was unreasonable. The court explained that since Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. arts. 1011a, 1011b, and 1101c authorized the city to enact zoning ordinances to regulate as to conserve property values and encourage the most appropriate use of property, and &sect; 6.05c bore a reasonable relation to that power, it was unable to substitute its judgment for that of the city.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the taxpayer and the taxpayer's trustee, challenged the judgment of the trial court (Texas) that awarded occupation taxes due under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 7066b to appellee State.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporate taxpayer was in the business of transporting petroleum products within Texas and operated under a contract carrier permit. Shortly before the taxpayer was dissolved, it obtained a certificate of convenience and necessity, rendering it a common carrier subject to the intangibles tax. The State sought payment of occupation taxes from the taxpayer for its last year of operation and the trial court ruled in favor of the State. The court affirmed the judgment, noting that under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 7066b(a), the taxpayer was liable for occupation taxes because it was a &quot;contract carrier&quot; on the first day of the year, which was when the tax assessment issued. The court construed Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. arts. 7211, 7151 as fixing the first day of the year as the date for determining liability for intangibles tax. Therefore, the taxpayer was not exempt from the occupation tax under the provision of art. 7066b(a) excluding entities subject to the intangibles tax from the occupation tax. Under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. arts. 7116, 7066b(a), relief from occupation tax liability was conditioned upon payment of the intangible assets tax for the year during which relief was sought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment, as reformed to deduct from the award a $ 50 assessment and a 10 percent penalty authorized under applicable statutes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought a declaratory judgment construing Senate Bill No. 36 and named as defendants members of the city fire and police departments who had served for 25 years or more in their departments. The trial court (Texas) found that the &quot;service&quot; qualifying one for a higher rate of pay could be service in the fire or police department before or after the passage and the effective date of Tex. Crim. Stat. Ann. art. 1583-2, &sect; 1, as amended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city contended that under art. 1583-2, &sect; 1, defendants would be entitled to $ 200 per month, as the provision for the additional sum of $ 10 per month for each five years of service meant service from and after the effective date of the act. Defendants contended that the &quot;service&quot; that qualified a person for a higher rate of pay could be service in the fire or police department before or after the passage and the effective date of the act. The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with defendants' contention, and on the city's appeal, the court approved the construction of the act adopted by the trial court. The court found that the construction was in accordance with the plain, unambiguous wording of the statutory enactment and that the legislative intent was clear. Such construction did not render the statute either retroactive or unconstitutional, and it was not within the court's province as a part of the judicial branch of government to determine whether the Legislature was wise in adopting the act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board of Equalization of appellee City of Taylor (Texas) reassessed the value of appellant taxpayers' properties. As a result, the taxpayers' property taxes increased. The taxpayers filed an action against the City and appellees, the City's board of commissioners and the city manager, seeking to enjoin the City from collecting the increased taxes. The taxpayers appealed after a trial court (Texas) denied their request for relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioners appointed nine people to serve on the City's Board of Equalization. Although the commissioners had authority to make the appointments and the appointees to the Board were all eligible and properly qualified to serve, the commissioners exceeded their authority under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 1048 (1937), when they named more than three people to the Board. The taxpayers challenged the legality of the Board and its tax reassessment decisions. They unsuccessfully claimed that, because the Board was not legally constituted, its actions were void. In affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that art. 1048 and Tex. Const. art. XI, &sect; 5 were controlling over the City's charter provisions. The Board was a de facto board. The power of appointment of the Board was vested and exercised by a lawful authority, and the members possessed the necessary qualifications. The members clearly held their office under a color of appointment and proceeded to discharge their duties with the appearance of acting with proper authority. The irregularity in the excess appointment of members did not render the Board's actions illegal or void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant election contestees challenged a judgment of a trial court (Texas), which held that an election for a tax increase carried and that an election for the issuance of bonds for an independent school district was defeated. Respondents were a county attorney and others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contestees argued that H.B. 344, ch. 333, 49th Leg. (Tex. 1945), which amended Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 2968, was unconstitutional. Article 2968 required that voters, who were exempt from the payment of a poll tax and lived in cities with a population of 10,000 or more, to obtain a certificate of exemption from the tax collector every year. The trial court held that 45 votes were illegal because the voters had failed to obtain exemption certificates for the current year. On appeal, the court held that H.B. 344, ch. 333, 49th Leg. (Tex. 1945) was constitutional. The caption of H.B. 344 was not misleading when read in connection with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 2968. The only change made in Article 2968 was the requirement that a voter should secure a certificate of exemption annually in lieu of a permanent certificate. Article 2968 and H.B. 344, ch. 333, 49th Leg. (Tex. 1945) were not unconstitutional as an excess of the legislature's power to limit the right of suffrage. Tex. Const. art. 6, &sect;4 authorized the legislature to enact laws to preserve the purity of the ballot box and to require registration of voters in cities of 10,000 inhabitants or more.</SPAN></P>
