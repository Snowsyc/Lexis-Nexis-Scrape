</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier, Louisiana, which convicted him of burglary of an inhabited dwelling, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62.2, and imposed the maximum sentence of 12 years at hard labor. Defendant argued that the State failed to prove that the residence was inhabited as required under &sect; 14:62.2 and that his sentence was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that because the victim was in the process of moving into the house, the evidence did not establish that the house was inhabited as required under &sect; 14:62.2. The victim testified that he did not consider the house to be his residence at the time. The court cited caselaw that accepted a dual residence possibility. The victim owned the house. It had belonged to his mother and contained his property. The utilities were connected. The victim spent some nights there while remodeling and intended to make it his permanent residence. The totality of this evidence showed that the house was inhabited pursuant to &sect; 14:62.2. Defendant could not challenge his sentence on appeal because he failed to make or file the required motion for reconsideration pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1(D). Regardless, the 12-year statutory maximum sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive for a third felony offender who had been arrested a total of 33 times. Defendant's sentence was actually illegally lenient under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62.2 because it did not prohibit parole, probation, or suspension during the first year, but the State had not appealed the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and 12-year sentence for burglary of an inhabited dwelling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of distribution of a controlled dangerous substance and was sentenced to 20 years of hard labor. Prior to defendant's sentence defendant filed a motion for a new trial. The trial court denied the motion and immediately sentenced defendant in violation of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 873. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's sentence. The case was remanded for resentencing. First, the court noted that the trial court properly considered defendant's prior criminal acts despite the fact that there was no full adjudication. The trial court properly relied on the presentence report and defendant was given an opportunity to present evidence to contradict the report. The court did find that reversible error occurred where defendant was not offered the 24-hour delay after the denial of the motion for a new trial. Because the sentence was illegally imposed, although it was not constitutionally excessive, it was null, and constituted no valid premise for continued incarceration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, municipal court judges and clerks, appealed the judgment of the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Iberia (Louisiana), which issued a writ of mandamus compelling the judges and clerks to collect a fee in addition to normal fines, costs, or forfeitures for each civil filing or criminal case in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1906. The judges and clerks claimed &sect; 13:1906 violated La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 14(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1906 required the judges and clerks to collect a fee in addition to normal fines, costs, or forfeitures for each civil filing or criminal case. The clerk was required to disburse the funds to plaintiff private non-profit corporation, which provided support and counseling for victims of family violence. The judges and clerks refused to collect the fee and the corporation filed suit. The trial court issued a writ of mandamus requiring the judges and clerks to comply with &sect; 13:1906. The judges and clerks claimed &sect; 13:1906 violated La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 14(A). The court held that art. 7, &sect; 14(A) prohibited a political subdivision from donating funds to nonprofit corporations and that to the extent La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1906 required the judges and clerks to collect and remit the funds to the corporation it was unconstitutional under La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 14(A). The court recognized that the state or a political subdivision thereof could contract with a private entity under La. Const. art. 7 &sect; 14(C) but found that there was no contract between the corporation and the judges and clerks' courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court, and recalled, vacated, and set aside the writ of mandamus issued by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens groups challenged the department's decision that granted an exception to the ban on the disposal of hazardous waste. The corporation sought to dismiss the challenge on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, and the citizens groups challenged the constitutionality of the statute relied on by the corporation. The court transferred the appeal to another court, and found that the basis of the citizens groups' challenge to the constitutionality of the statute was that the retroactive application of the jurisdiction provisions of the statute was an impermissible encroachment on the court in contravention to La. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 1, 2. The court held that the state constitution permitted the legislature to provide for appellate jurisdiction, and the retroactive application of jurisdiction did not encroach on the power and integrity of the court. The court held that under La. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(A), it was vested with appellate jurisdiction over &quot;civil matters&quot; but the decision of the department regarding hazardous waste was not a civil matter because the issue was not originally delegated to the judicial branch.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found the minimum sentence of two and a half years under a plea agreement to be excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a violation, relative to crime against nature. She entered into a plea bargain with the state, and the trial court charging her to be a twice- convicted felon, while she in actuality was a thrice-convicted felon. Under the agreement she was to be sentenced to 30 months at hard labor. The trial judge maintained that such a sentence was excessive and sentenced defendant to 18 months at hard labor. The state sought review. The court reviewed the record and determined that there was a specific and unambiguous plea struck by the state, defendant and the court. The state was aggrieved by the failure of the court to perform a promise upon which the state had relied to its tangible detriment. It relinquished its opportunity to file a triple offender bill in exchange for a commitment by defendant, her counsel and the court that defendant would receive a sentence of two and a half years. Strong public policy considerations supported the finality of plea bargains. The trial court had no authority to impose a sentence which did not comport with the agreement reached among all parties. The court vacated the sentence and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was severely injured in a head-on collision with defendant driver, who had been intoxicated. She also lost her unborn child. The trial court rendered judgment in her favor against defendants, driver and her parents' uninsured/underinsured motorist insurer, but denied her claims against the corporation that owned the tavern where defendant driver had been drinking just prior to the accident. She contended that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800.1 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that &sect; 9:2800.1, the statute that shields drinking establishments from liability when an intoxicated patron drives and causes injury, was constitutional. The burden was on plaintiff, as the party claiming unconstitutionality, to show that the statute had no rational basis. She did not sustain the burden. The state had an interest in narrowing the scope of liability of tavern keepers and social hosts and in allocating the consequences of irresponsible drinking to the person doing the drinking. The court held that 9:2800.1 was rationally related to this interest. The tavern did not assume a duty to protect the public from intoxicated patrons, nor was it a nuisance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company agreed to construct and lease to the State an 11,672 square foot building. Its permit application said that the building would be 9,615 square feet. Plaintiffs knew of the discrepancy. Under art. 5, &sect; 33.6 of the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance of the City of New Orleans, a conditional use permit was needed to operate a new development that was more than 10,000 square feet. Plaintiffs sought this permit after completion. The planning commission was deadlocked, and the council denied the application. The record supported the council's decision, and the district court correctly found that it was not arbitrary or capricious. The non-conforming use was in operation and square footage could not be changed before the application was sought. Art. 5, &sect; 33.6 was valid as written and applied. Plaintiffs' due process rights were not violated even if the council was not pleased with plaintiffs' past actions; plaintiffs were given an opportunity to present their case. Plaintiffs' equal protection rights were not violated; conditional use permits granted to other applicants were distinguishable from this application. Finally, there had been no unlawful taking of the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine and was sentenced as a second offender to 90 days' imprisonment.. In a writ application the State argued that the trial court erred by deviating from the mandatory minimum sentence of 30 months. The court granted the writ, but affirmed the sentence. Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, if the trial court found that the punishment mandated was constitutionally excessive, the trial court had the option, indeed the duty, to reduce such sentence to one that would not be constitutionally excessive. The trial court had to provide adequate support for any sentence which was less than the statutory minimum, making a meaningful assessment sufficient to justify a sentence below the mandatory minimum of &sect; 15:529.1. The trial court clearly expressed its belief that the mandatory minimum sentence was constitutionally excessive. The testimony from the probation officer and the administrator at the Drug Foundation provided the foundation for the sentence. The record reflected the trial court's careful consideration of this particular defendant, the facts and defendant's efforts to rehabilitate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed his ex-wife and was indicted for first-degree murder. Defendant was found guilty of second-degree murder and appealed his conviction. Although the court held that the allotment method used to select the trial judge was illegal, the error was harmless because the evidence of defendant's guilty was overwhelming. The court also determined that defendant's statements to the police prior to requesting an attorney were properly admitted at trial because he failed to argue this point in his motion to suppress and thus waived it. The court further stated that exculpatory material from witnesses that was disclosed at the trial did not warrant a new trial because defendant had time to review the evidence before the witnesses testified. In addition, the court held that the jury was not biased, and photographs of the victim were correctly admitted at trial, because they were not prejudicial. Finally, the court concluded that the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find defendant guilty of second-degree murder and the jury instructions were free from error. The court affirmed the conviction and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Louisiana Supreme Court had the authority to appoint the trial judge, the director failed to make such complaint to the trial court, and the judge did not try this case, so his authority or jurisdiction had no relevance to the judgment. The commissioner was acting under an order of liquidation that empowered him to deal with the insurance company's business. An insurer's business includes filing suit to collect monies owed to it. Thus, no court approval was necessary to bring this suit. The commissioner succeeded to all rights of the insurance company, which had a right of action against the debenture holders for return of any payments made which were not due. While he might also have had an action against them under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 745.1 or 745.3, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 745.3(K)(3) specifically permitted other types of claims, and his action was neither preempted nor prescribed. The trial court found &quot;sums were paid in violation of the language in the debenture itself.&quot; The court interpreted this as a finding of undercapitalization. The director was not entitled to a setoff because the insurance company owed her no debt; any obligation to repay the debentures was null.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that the commissioner was entitled to recover payments arising out of certain subordinated surplus debentures of the insurance company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">defendant was convicted of aggravated burglary, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat.

She gave a description of defendant, his car, and license plate number. The court held that the description gave police sufficient information to have probable cause to arrest defendant. The court found that a photo array out of which the victim picked defendant was not suggestive even though it had a 12-digit number on the bottom that contained the date of the photograph. The court held that a mistrial was properly granted under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 775 after the jury could not reach a verdict on attempted rape charges. The court found that double jeopardy did not attach pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 591. The prosecution was entitled to sever charges against defendant for his first trial and then rejoin them for the second trial. Defendant made no showing that he was prejudiced. Specific intent to commit a sexual battery was properly inferred from evidence that defendant touched the victim's breast.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also contended that the State offered no proof that his conduct was not pursuant to a valid prescription or order of a practitioner. The court found, however, that neither the statute under which defendant was charged, nor any other statute, required the State to prove the absence of a prescription. The court also found that the participation by the confidential informant (CI) by introduction of the agent was precisely the type of de minimis role that did not to warrant disclosure of the CI. The court held that the prosecutor's conclusion regarding the evidence that was reasonably drawn from the evidence was not improper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association (LIGA), as successor in liquidation of defendant insurer, sought review of the judgment of the 34th Judicial District Court, St. Bernard Parish, Division B (Louisiana), which did not apply La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1379(3)(d) and ordered LIGA to pay all interest and costs awarded in plaintiff worker's suit, whether incurred before or after the insurer's insolvency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer became insolvent following the entry of judgment against it and the insureds for damages of $ 215,000 sustained by the worker in an accident. As the insurer's legal successor in liquidation, LIGA was added as a defendant and raised issues founded on the law applicable to LIGA. On appeal from the trial court's judgment, LIGA argued that its liability was capped by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1382(A)(1)(a) at $ 149,900, including interest. In reversing, the court ruled that &sect; 22:1382(A)(1)(a) did indeed limit LIGA's liability but that court costs were excepted from the limit and that the effect of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1379(3)(d) was to limit recovery of court costs to those incurred after insolvency of the insurer. The court noted that, at the time of the accident giving rise to the insurer's liability, &sect; 22:1379(3)(d) did not limit recovery of court costs but that at the time of the insurer's insolvency, the &sect; 22:1379(3)(d) limitation had come into effect. The court ruled that the right of action against RIGA did not arise until such insolvency and that, therefore, the law in effect at that time, including &sect; 22:1379(3)(d), was applicable to the worker's claim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and rendered judgment for the worker against the insureds and LIGA, limiting LIGA's liability to its statutory limit, plus court costs accruing after the insurer's insolvency.</SPAN></P>

The court also noted the hospital's argument that the claim should have been first submitted to a medical review panel. Under the Medical Malpractice Act, La. Rev. Stat.

The trial court sentenced the defendant to 16 years hard labor. On appeal, the court affirmed the sentence. The court held that the trial court correctly decided that it was not bound by the Louisiana Sentencing Guidelines, which had been repealed before sentencing, that the sentence fell within the sentencing range of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967B, and that the trial court properly considered defendant's previous convictions for aggravated battery and other violent acts. However, the court remanded the case so that the trial court could credit defendant for time served pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 880. The court also rejected defendant's ineffective assistance of counsel claim because defendant's counsel did pursue appeal of the sentencing decision based on a non-frivolous argument.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:78.1A and B, and was sentenced pursuant to the plea agreement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 920, the court reviewed the record for errors patent on its face and found no errors patent. Defendant argued that the district court erred in imposing an excessive sentence and failed to give adequate consideration to mitigating factors. Defendant was sentenced after the repeal of the sentencing guidelines therefore the sentence was only reviewed for constitutional excessiveness. Defendant was sentenced to 15 years at hard labor on both counts to run concurrently with each other, less than the maximum of 20 years provided by law. The court held that the trial court was not required to articulate every circumstance or read through a checklist of items to comply with the requirements of La. Code Crim. P. art. 894.1, and that the trial court's failure to do so would not result in a remand for resentencing when there was an adequate factual basis in the record for the sentence. The court found that it was not unconstitutional to assess an indigent defendant a fine and costs as special conditions of probation, as long as jail time was not ordered in the event of default.</SPAN></P>

The Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) maintained the insurer's exception of no cause of action and dismissed the first amended and supplemental petition with prejudice. Appellant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was rear-ended by a car driven by an insured of the insurer. After the insurer answered appellant's original petition for damages, appellant filed a supplemental and amending petition seeking damages from the insurer for their failure to settle in a fair and prompt manner. Appellant based his claim on La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1220. The court noted that the duty imposed by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1220(A) was a duty owed by the insurer to its insured. The duty could be breached in any of the ways listed in &sect; 22:1220(B). In arguing that the insurer was liable to him for failing to settle in a fair and prompt manner and in failing to make a reasonable effort to settle the claim, appellant sought to bring himself within the coverage provided by &sect; 22:1220(B)(5). However, according to the court, the language of &sect; 22:1220(B)(5) allowed only an insured to state a claim under that subsection. Accordingly, the court held that because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1220(B)(5) granted a right of action to the insured only, and appellant failed to state a cause of action under &sect; 22:1220(B)(1) - (B)(4), the trial court correctly granted the insurer's exception of no cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the right to a jury trial in a civil action was governed by La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. arts. 1731 and 1732 and that it was not a constitutionally guaranteed right. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105 was a procedural statute and that it could be applied retrospectively because the legislature had not expressed a contrary intent. Although the Parish made its request for a jury trial more than ten days after the last pleading, contemplated by La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1733(C), the court found that the request was timely because it was made within ten days of the effective date of the amendment to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tract owners acquired property enclosing the parcel owner's lot from a lienor that had purchased the tract in its execution sale. The tract owners filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against the parcel owner's easements for roads and a pipeline. The parcel owner answered, and its mortgagee sought to intervene and answer. On appeal from the trial court's adverse judgment granting partial summary judgment, the parcel owner and its mortgagee argued that the mortgagee received no notice of the execution by the tract owners' predecessor, that no motion for summary judgment was filed against the mortgagee, and that the parcel owner had a right of way by necessity under La. Civ. Code Ann. arts. 689 - 696. In dismissing the parcel owner's appeal, the court held that the partial summary judgment was interlocutory because it did not grant relief but merely foreclosed one basis of defense and that, under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2083, the judgment was unappealable. In reversing as to the mortgagee, the court held that a no cause of action exception was an inappropriate device to oppose a petition to intervene and no relief had been requested against the mortgagee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the parcel owner's appeal, reversed the trial court's judgment sustaining the exception of no cause of action and granting partial summary judgment dismissing the mortgagee's intervention, and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court refused to address issues related to the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5105, stated that the Parish's request was untimely, and that there was not showing that the amount in controversy exceeded the jurisdictional amount. The court held that the statute had retrospective application because it effected a procedural right rather then a substantive right. The court affirmed the constitutionality of this statute. Although the Parish did not request a jury trial within ten days of the last pleading, as contemplated by La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1733, the Parish's request was timely because it was within ten days of the effective date of the statute. The court held that the burden was on the protester's to prove that the amount in controversy was less than the jurisdictional limit. The court held that an amendment to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1732 which raised the jurisdictional limit to $ 50,000 was interpretive law which could not be applied retrospectively. Therefore the court found that the jurisdictional limit for this action, initiated before the amendment remained at $ 20,000.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The deceased's will specifically stated that he was excluding his six children from his will because they had not contacted him for more than a period of two years.

The trial court upheld the will and the children appealed. The court affirmed after reviewing the extensive testimony. The court held that the deceased could legally exclude his adult children under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1621 if they failed to contact him over a two-year period. The court noted that the children's alienation from their father spanned a period of 14 years and that the children failed to prove that the cause stipulated for disinheritance did not exist or that they had reconciled with the deceased. The court rejected the children's contention that the deceased's wife was the cause of the alienation. The court further held that the children failed to prove that that the deceased's will was made under the fraud or duress of his wife, noting that the wife was not even present when the will was executed.</SPAN></P>

The doctor waited until the patient's next scheduled appointment before he reviewed the test results. The patient was forced to undergo a liver transplant.

Pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:2193 the deep-well injection of hazardous waste was prohibited unless an exemption was granted by the DEQ. The DEQ granted an exemption and the community and environmental organizations appealed. The court found that the organizations had a real and actual interest that was or could be adversely affected by the DEQ's decision and thus had standing under &sect; 30:2024(C). The court held that in reaching a decision the DEQ was required to make basic findings supported by evidence and ultimate findings that flowed rationally from the basic findings and it had to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the order used. The court found that the letter notifying the chemical company that the permit had been granted under certain conditions contained no basic findings supported by the evidence, ultimate findings, or an articulated rational connection between the facts found and the order issued.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an action brought by plaintiffs, a driver, the driver's wife, and a passenger, against defendant Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD) to obtain damages for personal injuries sustained by the driver and the passenger in a vehicular accident on a state highway, the DOTD sought review of the judgments of the 21st Judicial District Court, Parish of Tangipahoa (Louisiana) in favor of the driver, the wife, and the passenger.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver and the passenger were traveling down a state highway that was located on a federal enclave when their car collided with another vehicle. The driver, the passenger, and the wife alleged that the accident was caused when the driver's car struck an overhanging or felled tree limb. The trial court held that the DOTD was strictly liable under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2317. On appeal, the court reversed. The trial court improperly found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:347 gave the DOTD the authority to cut trees hanging over the highway. The trial court erroneously relied on a contract between the State and a contractor in determining that the trees with overhanging limbs were growing within a DOTD right-of-way through federal property; the contract was for a different highway and was irrelevant. The trial court improperly relied on La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800 and La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2317 in imposing liability. The felled tree limb was a temporary condition, not a defect; furthermore, the trees were outside of the DOTD's right-of-way and were therefore outside its ownership. Because the DOTD did not have notice of the alleged hazard, it was not negligent.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the trial court clearly understood that before a sentence could be reduced below the mandatory minimum, the trial court was required to find that the mandatory minimum sentence was unconstitutionally excessive as to defendant. The court found that the conclusory statements of the trial court, however, did not constitute the type of &quot;meaningful assessment&quot; sufficient to justify imposing a sentence below the mandatory minimum sentence under the Habitual Offender Law.

He was sentenced to ten years in prison. The court affirmed, rejecting as without merit the numerous errors raised by defendant on appeal. The court held that the evidence introduced in the perjury trial did not constitute a relitigation of the issues and that the state did not violate the collateral estoppel doctrine. The State limited its presentation to evidence that corroborated the confession and the murder. Testimony of the forensic pathologist and autopsy photos corroborated that physical contact had occurred, contrary to defendant's prior testimony, and that manual strangulation was the cause of the death. The court held that the State did not err in using excerpted portions of defendant's prior trial testimony, where it used only testimony that was relevant to the perjury charge. Jurors' prior knowledge that defendant had confessed to the murders did not prejudice defendant because the confession was used at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client filed a legal malpractice suit against his former attorney alleging that a document prepared by the attorney damaged him in a succession suit.

The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 9:5606 legislatively abrogated the ten-year prescriptive period for breach of contract in legal malpractice claims. The court held that the client's claim was untimely because the statute similarly reduced the time period within which his breach of contract claim could be brought. The court also held that the clients claim was perempted when the statutory grace period expired. The issue of whether the statute was unconstitutional was not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had a deputy clerk backdate six petitions filed in the clerk of court's office. Defendant argued that the indictment did not set out a crime punishable by law, that the filing of a petition for damages containing incorrect information was not a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:133, and that the definition of &quot;public record&quot; under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44: 1(A)(2) was not met by the petitions he filed. The charge was not that defendant filed incorrect pleadings, but that he knowingly and intentionally filed false documents into a public record, the behavior which La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:133 sought to punish. The court found that it was clear that the jury must have believed that defendant had knowledge that the petitions he filed alleged false dates of filing, that any rational trier of fact could have found that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the sentence, of six two-year concurrent sentences, was not excessive. The statutory maximum under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:133 would have been six five-year sentences, to run consecutively, or thirty years. The court held that the sentence was commensurate with the crime.</SPAN></P>

In affirming, the court ruled that taxpayers had sufficient interest at stake to confer standing under La. Code Civ. Proc.

The court also ruled that, while the attorney general was the state's chief legal officer under La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Division issued a citation to the restaurant and proposed to revoke the restaurant's video gaming license on the grounds that it allowed a minor to play or operate a video poker device and failed to provide an employee to prevent access to the gaming area by minors, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4862.19(A); La. Admin. Code tit. 42 &sect;&sect; XI:2417(A)(5), XI:2415(C)(1)(b)(iii). A hearing officer, finding that she had no authority to review the constitutionality of the applicable statutes, found that the restaurant was responsible for the violations and affirmed the proposed license revocation. The trial court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed. Revocation of the restaurant's license was not too harsh a penalty; revocation was required under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4862.19(B). The hearing officer's decision was not contrary to the evidence; while there was conflicting testimony as to whether a child actually entered the video gaming area, the officer's credibility determinations were entitled to great deference.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim slipped and fell on a half-inch crack in a sidewalk. The university challenged the trial court's finding that it was liable for the resulting injuries, finding that the victim's witness was an expert, and finding that the university had knowledge of the defect. The court affirmed the judgment. First, the court held that the victim's witness was properly qualified as an expert witness because the witness had the necessary knowledge and experience. Second, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the half-inch crack rendered the sidewalk defective. The university's expert witness testimony that a depression of less than two inches was not defective was based on personal opinion. Third, the court held that although the university did not have actual knowledge of the depression, there was evidence that the defect had existed for a number of years. Given the length of time the defect existed and the opportunity the university had to discover it, together with the testimony that it would have been discovered had the university made routine inspections, the trial court's findings were not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, 19 years old at the time of the offenses, was babysitting his half-sisters, aged 8 and aged 6. He forced both children to remove their clothing, penetrated the eight-year old anally, and hit her when she cried, causing her nose to bleed and forced the six-year old to submit to vaginal and oral sex with him. The sentencing guidelines recommended a 7-9 year sentence on each count, but the trial judge departed from the guidelines. The court held that the trial court was justified in departing from the guidelines. The court noted that defendant had received an enormous benefit from his plea agreement, which reduced the original charges of aggravated rape, which carried a possible life sentence. The court further noted that defendant had a significant juvenile record, an adult record with felony convictions, and was a drug user. Finally, the court noted that defendant had showed no remorse at the time of sentencing, merely inquiring when he would be eligible for parole.</SPAN></P>

The other perpetrator was severed at the time of trial for appointment of a sanity commission. Defendants appealed their convictions, arguing, among other points, that the evidence was insufficient and that a continuance should have been granted when the proceedings were severed. In affirming, the court found that the evidence was sufficient for any rational trier of fact to have found the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. The court ruled that, under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 704, jointly indicted defendants were tried jointly unless the trial court elected to try them separately, and that once the other perpetrator's mental capacity was raised, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 642 suspended the proceedings as to him, but not as to defendants, and severance was proper. The court also ruled that, pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 707 and 712, the decision on the continuance was within the trial court's discretion and was not disturbed, absent an abuse resulting in prejudice to defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After learning that several parish employees had withdrawn their retirement funds from the system to participate in the parish commission's program, the system advised the commission of the mandatory membership provisions applicable to parish employees and stated that it would file a lawsuit in district court to compel the employees at issue to be enrolled in the system. The trial court found that the system was required under the Louisiana Administrative Procedure Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:950, et seq., to hold an adjudicatory hearing before it could file a declaratory action in district court. On appeal, the court noted that one's right to retirement funds constituted a property right. The court found, however, that there was no governmental action that deprived any person of such a right because the system's decision to file suit did not deprive any person of property. Therefore, the court concluded that the trial court erred in granting the exception of prematurity.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dissolved the temporary restraining order (TRO), denied the motion for preliminary injunction, held the statute unconstitutional and dismissed the peremptory exceptions. The case was appealed directly to the supreme court, which affirmed the trial court's dissolution of the TRO as well as denial of the levee board's motion for preliminary injunction, reversed the unconstitutionality of the statute, maintained the district attorney's peremptory exceptions, and dismissed the suit. The district attorney filed for damages and attorney fees, which were granted. The levee board appealed, and the court held that as two assistant district attorneys, regularly employed, worked on the case, the office was deprived of their regular service, entitling it to an amount for their fees.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;14:64, relative to armed robbery, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:95.1, relative to convicted felon in possession of a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant cited numerous points of error on appeal. The court affirmed, finding that defendant's assignments of error were without merit or, if error, they were harmless. The court held that a hypothetical situation presented by the court during voir dire was not a comment on the facts or evidence within the purview of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 772, because no evidence had yet been presented in the proceeding. Admission of the contents of a phone call by an unidentified person could be said, beyond a reasonable doubt, not to have contributed to the verdict. Although the testimony was hearsay, it was admissible as part of the res gestae, and supported the victim's testimony that the same person robbed her on both nights in question. Because defendant's arrest for possession of a concealed weapon followed from a legal stop and search, the subsequent identification procedure was not tainted. The trial court's failure to give a circumstantial evidence charge did not constitute reversible error because there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction. The failure to give an instruction on circumstantial evidence, assuming that the court failed to do so, was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence for armed robbery and possession of a handgun by a convicted felon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to aggravated incest with his adopted stepdaughter and was sentenced to 15 years hard labor. On appeal, he challenged the constitutionality of aggravated incest statute and argued that the sentence was excessive. The court affirmed and held that statute was not unconstitutional on its face. The court determined that the requirement that the victim be under 18 years of age was not a vague or ambiguous standard. In addition, the statute enumerated a clear list of relatives who could be victims of the offense, specified that the offender had to be aware of his relationship to the victim, and plainly set forth the prohibited acts. The court further determined that although defendant's conduct came within the purview of several statutes, the charge of aggravated incest most closely described defendant's conduct. The court determined that the public policy of protecting juvenile family members from adult relatives far outweighed any unfairness associated with the increased penalty. Moreover, based upon the impact of the crime upon the victim and the duration of defendant's conduct, the sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor delivered the patient's baby. There were complications in the delivery and the doctor twisted the baby's head, causing Erb's palsy and diaphragmatic paralysis. The patient sued the doctor for her loss of enjoyment of life, special care and services for the child, and mental anguish damages. The doctor filed an exception of prematurity and argued that the patient had signed a binding arbitration agreement by which she agreed to submit all claims against him to binding arbitration. The doctor then filed an exception of prescription and a motion to exclude evidence. The trial court entered a consent judgment referring the patient's claims to arbitration. The trial court held a hearing on the doctor's motions and dismissed them because it held that they must be submitted to arbitration. The doctor appealed. The court held that because the patient's claims arose out of negligence the doctor was bound by the arbitration agreement. The court found no error in the trial court's ruling.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a legal malpractice action, plaintiff clients appealed a judgment of the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which granted an exception of prescription filed by defendants attorney and his insurer. At issue on appeal were whether a pre-statute breach of contract theory applied, and whether enactment of a statute had disturbed the client's vested right to sue or whether the claim had prescribed prior to enactment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The clients appealed the judgment granting an exception of prescription filed by the attorney and his insurer, in the client's malpractice action. The pre-statute breach of contract theory had not applied, as the clients failed to produce evidence that the attorney warranted a specific result or that he agreed to perform certain work. As to the question of whether the enactment of a statute in 1990, which changed the law, disturbed the client's vested right to sue or whether the claim had prescribed prior to the enactment, the client's filed their action before the cut-off date for the application of the new statute. However, this was irrelevant if the claim was prescribed prior to enactment. The court concluded the client's had the underlying facts necessary to have asserted their cause of action in 1987. It was then that they suffered appreciable damages and then that they knew or should have known that the document would not protect their property from creditors. Thus, the district court had not erred in finding that the claim was prescribed in 1988, under the one year prescriptive period of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3492, or under the later enacted statute and its amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was affirmed. The costs of the appeal were to have been paid by the clients.</SPAN></P>

The trial court accepted his guilty plea and refused to allow him to withdraw it. On appeal from his conviction and sentence, defendant argued that his sentence was excessive and that he should not have been subjected to registration as a sex offender pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:540 et seq., which he maintained were unconstitutional. In affirming, the court ruled that the trial court was not required under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 559(A) to permit withdrawal of a knowing and voluntary plea. The court also ruled that defendant was not required to have been informed of the registration and community notification requirements for sex offenders as they were not part of his sentence. The court found that registration and community notification did not violate his privacy rights and were a constitutional means of advancing the compelling state interest in protecting the public from sex offenders. The court held that the trial court stated an adequate basis for exceeding the guidelines of former La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 in imposing sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's refusal to permit him to withdraw his guilty plea. Defendant videotaped minor girls engaging in sexually compromising acts for his own gratification. The trial court held that defendant's plea was knowing and intelligent. The court opined that because defendant had 12 prior arrests for different crimes, had failed to show remorse, and had inflicted severe emotional damage on the victims, a maximum sentence beyond the statutory guidelines for first-time sexual offenders was appropriate. On appeal, the court held that under the circumstances the sentence was not excessive either under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 or La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The trial court articulated sufficient reasons to exceed the recommended sentencing range. However, the trial court erred in ordering defendant to register as a sex offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:540-549 because defendant's offense took place before the effective date of the sexual offender registry statute, i.e., June 18, 1992.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 48:441 - 48:460, to expropriate additional right of way from defendant landowners for the replacement of a bridge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the design of the bridge was based on assumptions which, more likely than not, were incorrect and thus concluded that the State was arbitrary and capricious in expropriating the landowners' property on the basis of such design. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that even though the State had wide discretion in determining the necessity and extent of the taking, the State's discretion was not unbridled. The court concluded that an expropriating authority should be in a position to justify and support with cogent reasons a taking for an appropriate purpose. The court found that the State's design engineers could not justify the State's data, particularly traffic counts and hydraulic evaluation used in selecting the design for the bridge. Therefore, the court concluded that the trial court was not manifestly erroneous in finding that the State acted arbitrarily and capriciously.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By writ of application, relator challenged the trial court's acceptance of his guilty pleas to the misdemeanor offenses of possession of undersized catfish and failure to maintain records. Relator was a Georgia track driver who transported frozen channel catfish across state lines for resale. When stopped by Department of Wildlife and Fisheries agents, as much as 75 percent of the catfish in his truck were undersized in violation of state conservation laws. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 56:326A(7)(b) was not unconstitutionally vague and did not deny relator equal protection of the laws. Relator was more than a mere truck driver--he was a licensed wholesale/retail dealer under &sect; 56:306.B4 and was criminally responsible for transporting undersized catfish because &sect; 56:326A contained no scienter requirement. Relator's 60-day sentence and $ 700 fine were not excessive; however, relator should have been credited with time served. The trial court lacked jurisdiction to make forfeiture of the seized catfish part of relator's sentence because that type of forfeiture was solely within the province of the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries in accordance with &sect;&sect; 56:58 and 56:60.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners sought to recover severance taxes paid under protest. The 19th Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Baton Rouge (Louisiana) dismissed the claim, holding that severance tax statutes were valid and enforceable. The district court found for defendant taxation department on its reconventional demand, as it found landowners liable for severance taxes. The landowners filed a writ application that was granted in part.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue on appeal was the recovery of severance taxes paid under protest. The landowners contended that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:1 specifically prohibited the levying of severance taxes. They argued that the department's contention that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:2 was the controlling statute in the matter, rather than &sect; 52:1, fell when the provisions were compared to La. Const. art. IV, &sect; 12. Section 52:2 had its origin in Act No. 75 of the Louisiana Legislative Session of 1940. Upon analysis, it became obvious that the purpose of the Act was to carry out the provisions of art. IV, &sect; 12. Section 1 of the Act was a verbatim recitation of art. IV, &sect; 12, with &sect; 2 of the Act defining who the authorized representatives were to have been in the event the State or any agency, branch, municipality or subdivision thereof donated or otherwise conveyed to the United States any lands, property, or movable and immovable. Thus, the court found that the department's argument as to the applicability of &sect; 52:2 was without merit. As the court found the pre-amended version of &sect; 52:1 was dispositive of the issue to have been addressed on remand, it was unnecessary to address other arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court on the reconventional demand was reversed. The costs of the appeal assessed to the landowners in the original judgment were to have been reassessed and shared pro-rata with the department of revenue and taxation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs property owners appealed an order from the Fifteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Lafayette (Louisiana), finding that the Louisiana Seizure and Controlled Dangerous Substances Property Forfeiture Act of 1989 (ACT), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2601, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed a petition alleging that the Act was unconstitutional following the state's seizure of certain property. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. First the court held that statutes were presumed constitutional, and the party challenging a statute's validity must articulate a particular constitutional provision that limits the legislature's powers. The court noted that forfeiture cases were not to be approached in the context of criminal law and in reliance upon criminal precepts, but rather in the context of property law. Forfeiture cases were civil in nature and were governed by the rules of civil procedure. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:2601 was constitutional in that it did not deprive any of the property owners of due process of the law. Second the court held that pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1732(7), a trial by jury was not available in cases where a jury trial was specifically denied by law. The denial of a jury trial in a civil forfeiture proceeding did not violate the constitution. Lastly, the court held that there was no equal protection violation because the law applied equally to all citizens similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties did not contest the district court's finding that the deck hand was a seaman as contemplated by the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.S. &sect; 688. At the time of his accident, he was believed to have been employed by marine towing corporation. In actuality, the corporation did not own any assets, but was only a common paymaster. The actual employer was determined. The president of the towing corporation was either the president or vice-president in charge of operations of the actual employer. Thus, although the district court found negligence in failing to maintain a reasonably safe work environment, it was argued that the president, in his personal capacity, should not have been held responsible for liability under the Jones Act, as he was not personally the employer. The court concluded that both the presumed and actual employers had enough connexity with the employment to be considered the deck hand's Jones Act employer. However, the court could not hold the president personally responsible for liability imposed on his corporations. In order to impose such liability, the court had to pierce the corporate veil, and no evidence supported such an action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded in part.

The trial court found no error in the determination of the passenger's lost wages.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant public interest groups disputed a decision of appellee Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) granting a company an exemption from La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:2193, which prohibited the deep well injection of hazardous waste. The court considered whether La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:2024(C), as amended by 1995 La. Acts 1208, was constitutional, the effect on the court's jurisdiction if not, and the adequacy of DEQ's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under 1995 La. Acts 1208 (Act), which was enacted after the filing of the appeal, the court no longer had jurisdiction to review the DEQ decision. The public interest groups argued that the Act violated La. Const. art. III, &sect; 15(A). On appeal, the court held that, because the issue had not existed before the appeal was filed, the groups could raise it for the first time on appeal. The court held that the Act did violate art. III, &sect; 15(A), because it had two objects, the providing of witness fees in state agency proceedings and the jurisdiction to review agency decisions. Because the Act was void ab initio, the court had jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to 1995 La. Acts 947, &sect; 1. Although it was not raised as an assignment of error, under La. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 the court had the duty to consider the adequacy of the DEQ decision. The court held that DEQ's letter notifying the company that the exemption had been granted under certain conditions with the attached conditions and response to public comments fell far short of satisfying the jurisprudential requirements for decision-rendering by the DEQ. The court instructed the DEQ as to what was required and remanded.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction asserting that he lacked the required intent and that the eyewitness was not credible. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. First the court held that specific intent was defined as that state of mind which existed when the circumstances indicated that the offender actively desired the prescribed criminal consequences to follow his act or failure to act. The court determined that the fact that the victim was killed by only a single bullet when three shots were fired did not negate the fact that defendant intentionally aimed and fired three shots in close succession directly at the victim. Under these circumstances, the evidence of specific intent was sufficient to convict defendant of second degree murder. The court held that defendant did not commit manslaughter because there was no evidence of passion immediately caused by provocation sufficient to deprive defendant of self-control. Second, the court held that the jury was informed of the eyewitness's criminal record and the fact that he was paid and it was up to the jury to resolve credibility issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an adverse ruling on defendant's motions to quash indictment and suppress evidence, she plead guilty in the Fourteenth Judicial District Court Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana) to possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of cocaine over 400 grams. In pleading, defendant reserved her right to seek appellate review of the rulings. She was concurrently sentenced to 5 years on the first charge and 15 years on the second.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the adverse ruling on her motions to quash indictment and suppress evidence. She claimed La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:361.1 was unconstitutional, and thus, the stop, search, and arrest based on the statute were illegal. In virtually every case in which a police officer testifies, an impression garnered from the senses was sought. The officer testified that even though he thought the window tinting was too dark, the degree of tinting was determined with a light transmission meter before a violation was found and a ticket issued. The statute had not violated defendant's right to privacy, her constitutional challenge failed. The interest in public safety was weighed against the intrusion into the driver's personal liberty occasioned by requiring her to have maintained windows with significant visibility; the intrusion was minimal. The search fell within the automobile exception to the search warrant requirement. Probable cause existed based on the totality of the evidence: the conflicting stories, the nervousness of the driver and passenger, the record of narcotics violations, and the indication by the dog. Exigent circumstances arose, as the automobile was mobile.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court was amended to give defendant credit for time served, and was affirmed as amended. The case was remanded to the district court for amendment of the commitment and minute entry of the sentence to reflect the credit for time served. The costs of the appeal were assessed against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the sentence of five years was not excessive because defendant was a second felony offender and the first offense was a serious offense.

The oil company also appealed the judgment awarding attorney fees and the award of use and sales taxes for certain tax years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State initiated proceedings seeking to collect use and sales taxes allegedly owed on two by-products of the refining process, namely, refinery gas and coke-on catalyst. The oil company filed an exception of prescription, alleging that the State could not collect taxes for certain tax years. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment that granted a portion of the exception. The court noted that La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 16 provided that all claims for taxes prescribed within three years after the 31st day of December in the year in which the taxes became due. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1580 provided the circumstances under which prescription was suspended. The court concluded that the trial court's judgment was not erroneous because the trial court was in the best position to judge the parties and determine whether the oil company waived the prescription period. Likewise, the court held that there was no error in finding that prescription had not attached to the taxes owed for certain tax years. Last, the court held that the award of attorney fees was proper because the trial court was in the better position to judge the amount of services performed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:305(D)(1)(h) (1985) to determine the amount of the refund due to appellee taxpayer for a sales and use tax overpayment on refinery gas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer operated a petroleum refinery. The Parish assessed unpaid sales and use taxes against the taxpayer for refinery gas and coke-on-catalyst for the period between January of 1985 and October of 1990. The taxpayer paid the taxes under protest and filed four separate actions to recover refunds. The trial court consolidated the actions and held hearings on cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court declared La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:305(D)(1)(h)&nbsp;unconstitutional and rejected the taxpayer's demands for refunds except for the exemption of refinery gas used for purposes other than as boiler fuel. On appeal, the supreme court reversed the judgment and remanded the action for a determination of the value of the taxable refinery gas in accordance with &sect; 47:305(D)(1)(h), and other proceedings. On remand, the trial court recalculated the refund of the tax and penalty paid by the taxpayer as to the refinery gas. On appeal, the court affirmed the amount calculated for the refund. Knowing that some of the taxing period pre-dated the effective date of the Act, the supreme court nonetheless ordered the trial court to use the formula in the post-amendment statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the calculation of the refund due to the taxpayer for the sales and use tax overpayment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a decision granting a motorist's exception of no cause of action based on La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315.6, the court affirmed, dismissing an action brought by a mother of minor children. The decedent was hit by a van and killed as he was attempting to cross a highway. The minor children were first cousins of the decedent and witnessed the accident. The mother brought an action for the mental anguish and emotional distress her minor children suffered from witnessing the death of the decedent. The court held that Louisiana law, pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315.6, recognized a cause of action based upon the so-called &quot;bystander recovery rule.&quot; However, the court held that the legislature chose to limit the permissible claimants for bystander mental anguish damages to close relatives of the victim, and not first cousins. Further, La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315.6 did not violate the mother's right to equal protection of the laws and was constitutional. Thus, the mother had no right of action for mental anguish based on the death of decedent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the surviving second wife of a testator, and appellees, the testator's two daughters from his prior marriage, sought review of the judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), distributing the testator's estate between the wife and daughters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that a donation made to the wife, through the testator's execution of a power of attorney, was a valid inter vivos donation; that inter vivos donations by the testator should not be added to the estate mass in determining the amount of the forced portion; and that the usufruct in favor of the wife over the daughters' forced portion was an impermissible impingement on their legitime and was thus invalid. All parties appealed. The court held that there was no manifest error in the trial court's factual finding that the testator made a valid inter vivos donation of funds to the wife. The court held that the trial court erred in excluding inter vivos donations to the wife from the calculation of the active mass of the estate in arriving at the disposable portion of the legitime m, pursuant to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1505, but that it did not err in excluding the inter vivos donations to the daughters, which were exempt under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1502. It further held, overruling Succession of Suggs, 612 So. 2d 297 (La. Ct. App. 1992), that under La. Civ. Code Ann. 890, the wife's usufruct was not an impingement on the legitime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment finding valid donations and allowing succession expenses to the wife, but reversed the judgment insofar as it failed to include donations to the wife in computing the succession mass and the forced portion, and insofar as it found that the usufruct granted in favor of the wife impinged on the daughters' legitime.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:688 and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:1299.65. The city health care plan limited to $ 500.00 the maximum annual benefit payable for spinal manipulative therapy and any physical therapy type modalities rendered in connection therewith by osteopathic physician, chiropractor or medical doctor. The doctor and the chiropractic association asserted that the city's plan discouraged participants from selecting chiropractic treatment methods, and discriminated against practitioners of the chiropractic profession. The doctor and the chiropractic filed a summary judgment, which was granted. On appeal the court affirmed. The court held that the limiting language in the plan was discriminatory against the method of practice employed by chiropractor. The court determined that although spinal manipulative therapy was not necessarily a method exclusively employed by chiropractors, it was critical to the practice of chiropractic.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana, which convicted him of two counts of armed robbery, three counts of attempted second degree murder, and sentenced him to serve three concurrent 50 year sentences on the attempted murder counts, to run consecutively with two concurrent 99 years sentences on the armed robbery counts, without benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted based upon evidence that he shot his victims during an armed robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that defendant waived the prosecutor's failure to sign a page of the indictment because he did not object to the defect prior to trial. The court amended the sentence for attempted murder to delete the restrictions against probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The court found that the identifications were not suggestive. The fact that one victim was unable to make an identification while she was heavily sedated did not detract from her subsequent positive identification. The court found that the identifications were reliable because each of the victims had a good opportunity to observe defendant. The court noted that the descriptions they gave immediately after the incident were accurate and that all of them expressed certainty as to the identifications. Moreover, the time between the offense and the line-ups ranged from 10 to 23 days. The court ruled that the consecutive sentences were not excessive given the fact that the defendant &quot;cold-bloodedly and deliberately&quot; tried to execute the victims even though they did not resist the robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and amended the sentence to delete the requirement that the sentences for attempted second degree murder be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The court affirmed the sentence, as amended.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62. Defendant had withdrawn his plea of not guilty and pleaded guilty to the charge of simple burglary of an automobile in violation La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant changed his plea to guilty as charged by the bill of information with simple burglary of an automobile in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62, the State filed a multiple bill charging that defendant was a third felony offender. The trial court sentenced defendant to less than the minimum sentence required by the Habitual Offender Law and &sect; 14:62, and the State sought to invoke supervisory jurisdiction to reverse the ruling. The court vacated the sentence and remanded the case for resentencing, holding that the trial court failed to sufficiently find that the statutorily mandated minimum sentence would have been unconstitutional as applied to defendant. The trial court merely noted that it had considered defendant's age and that it felt that any higher amount of time than six years would have been unjust. The court held that such statements did not indicate that the trial court made a search and inquiry necessary to justify declaring a legislatively mandated sentence unconstitutional nor did they indicate that the trial court made a meaningful assessment of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances appropriate to the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty in the Thirty-Second Judicial District Court for the Parish of Terrebonne (Louisiana) to two counts of aggravated rape, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14: 42(A)(2), (3), and (5), reserving his right to appeal the trial court's denial of a motion to suppress. He argued that he did not consent to the taking of blood samples, a statement he gave after his arrest was inadmissible, his sentence was excessive, and there was patent error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While officers were investigating the unsolved crimes, defendant stopped, identified himself as a police informant, and offered to help. After rejecting his offer, they realized that he fit the description of the person they were seeking. They invited him to come to the station and he drove there several times to discuss the case. Blood samples implicated defendant and he made a videotaped statement admitting the crimes. On appeal, the court held that the denial of the motion to suppress indicated that the trial court accepted the officers' version of the events and rejected defendant's. The evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that defendant freely and voluntarily consented to the blood test at a time when he was not being detained. The court held that, before giving the statement, defendant waived the presence of counsel. Because he consented to the blood tests, the statement was not fruit of the poisonous tree. Given the circumstances of the crimes, imposition of life sentences for the aggravated rapes was not excessive and did not violate La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20. The trial court's patent error in failing to comply with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 642 was harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions for aggravated rape and the mandatory sentences of life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowner challenged a judgment of the 22nd Judicial District Court in and for Washington Parish, Louisiana, which dismissed her suit that alleged she was injured by an unreasonably dangerous pothole in a city-owned right-of-way, and found that she failed to show that defendant city had actual or constructive notice of the pothole as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the homeowner was exiting her car, she stepped into a pothole, injuring her right knee and ankle; she was very depressed and had crying spells. The city admitted it was aware for five and one-half months before the accident that there was some sort of problem. On appeal, the court held that, based on the length of time the pothole existed and the city's knowledge of the problem, the trial court was clearly wrong in finding that the homeowner failed to show that the city had constructive notice. The trial court was also legally wrong in dismissing the suit for failure to prove notice. Failure to prove notice was not a sound legal basis for dismissal of a claim against a governmental entity. The court, therefore, conducted its own de novo review. Had the city investigated the homeowner's complaint, it would have known of the problem. She, however, was acutely aware of the pothole at the end of her driveway, and she admitted she could easily have avoided the accident had she looked before she stepped. Thus, she was clearly in a superior position to avoid the accident. The court, therefore, assigned fault 75 percent to the homeowner and 25 percent to the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court dismissing the homeowner's suit. The court rendered judgment in the homeowner's favor and against the city for general and special damages, reduced by 75 percent.</SPAN></P>

As a result, defendant was convicted of second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:30.1 and 14:27. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 801, defendant's failure to object to the omission of jury instructions on self-defense or justification precluded review. Louisiana did not recognize a plain error rule except where the errors substantially affected the fairness of the proceedings and the reliability of the fact-finding process, which was not present in defendant's trial. Because the evidence against self-defense was overwhelming, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 802(1) did not require the trial court to instruct the jury on self-defense or justification. Therefore, the judgment was proper.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64.1, classified defendant as a habitual offender in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 and sentenced to 50 years hard labor without parole or probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After robbing a bank, defendant was given a ride home by a store employee, who later led police to defendant's residence. Police entered the residence without a warrant after noticing defendant in the house. The court affirmed, but remanded in order for the trial court to give defendant credit for time served in accordance with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 880. The trial court committed harmless error in failing to specify whether defendant was a second or third offender because the maximum sentence was 80 years for both second and third felony offenders. The police were justified in entering defendant's residence without a warrant because, after seeing defendant enter the bathroom, there was reason to believe he might try to destroy evidence. The trial court did not err in considering defendant's 1967 burglary conviction in his habitual offender hearing because although defendant was discharged from that conviction more than five years before the present offense, his commission of a second felony was within five years of his discharge on the first felony and commission of the instant felony was within five years of discharge on the second felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for first-degree robbery, his classification as a habitual offender and his sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, the owners and the manager of a gay bathhouse, challenged a judgment from the Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans, Division &quot;A&quot; (Louisiana), which denied their motion to dissolve a preliminary injunction or, alternatively, to require that plaintiff City of New Orleans post security for an injunction it obtained preventing defendants from operating the top three floors of the spa until it complied with city fire and building codes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A City fire inspector cited the manager of the bathhouse with 20 separate violations of the city fire code and building code. The City obtained a preliminary injunction enjoining the operation of the top three floors of the spa. Defendants filed a motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction or, in the alternative, to require the City to furnish security. The trial court denied relief. On appeal, the court affirmed. The City was not seeking to punish defendants by enjoining them from endangering the public as long as they failed to correct the deficiencies constituting the fire safety code violations. It was simply fulfilling its duty to protect the public from fire hazards. The injunctive relief it sought was not punishment for defendants' alleged violation of the municipal ordinances and could not constitute cruel, excessive, or unusual punishment. The fact that the manager was charged individually with violating a municipal ordinance did not subject defendants to double jeopardy. La. Const. art. XII, &sect; 10 encompassed the power to dispense with the need for the City to furnish security for the injunctive relief it sought, which was in the nature of a &quot;procedural&quot; matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of defendants' motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction enjoining the operation of the top three floors of the spa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee fishermen filed an action against appellant State of Louisiana seeking damages resulting from a freshwater diversion project. The state, through the Department of Natural Resources (the DNR), appealed from a judgment of the 25th Judicial District Court, Plaquemines Parish (Louisiana), denying its exception of improper venue. the DNR sought supervisory writs from the denial of its dilatory exception of nonjoinder of a necessary party.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fishermen asserted that their leases in the St. Bernard and Plaquemines parishes were damaged because of the intrusion of freshwater by way of the state's freshwater diversion project. the DNR contended that the case should be transferred to the East Baton Rouge Parish, where the decision was made to adopt the project. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the DNR's venue exception was properly denied under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5104(A). The fishermen were not seeking damages because of the DNR's decisions or any state policy to restore wetlands, but rather, they alleged that the project resulted in a taking of their property for which they were entitled to be compensated. The court further held that the trial court properly denied the exception of nonjoinder based on the fishermen's failure to join the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries as a defendant. Although the source of the fishermen's property rights was the leases they obtained from the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, there was no need to add the department as a defendant. Finally, the court declined to interfere with the trial court's denial of the DNR's motion to compel discovery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the writs filed by the state and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court also vacated its previous stay order that had been issued in response to the trial court's denial of the DNR's motion to compel discovery in the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which entered a jury verdict convicting him of forcible rape in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:42.1 and aggravated burglary in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:60 and sentenced him to serve 20 years at hard labor for the rape conviction and to serve a consecutive term of 15 years at hard labor for the burglary conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim of a burglary and rape identified defendant in a photographic lineup as the perpetrator of the offenses. Fingerprint and hair samples taken from the victim's home matched those of defendant. On appeal from his convictions and sentences, defense counsel requested only an error patent review. The court affirmed. The trial court denied defendant's application for post-conviction relief and the court affirmed; however, the state supreme court ordered an out-of-time appeal. The court, after reviewing defendant's allegations of error, once again affirmed. The fact that the record did not contain a ruling on defendant's motion to suppress the victim's identification prior to trial did not constitute reversible error because the victim made an independent in-court identification of defendant. Defendant's consecutive sentences were not excessive under U.S. Const. amend. VIII or La. Const. of 1974, art. I, &sect; 20. La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 883 allowed the trial court to impose consecutive sentences for offenses arising out of the same scheme or plan; furthermore, the trial court set forth aggravating factors. The evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Section J (Louisiana), which resentenced him to 21 years at hard labor after a manslaughter conviction. The issue was whether, after the court vacated an original sentence of 21 years at hard labor, the trial court had, as noted in the remand, properly considered the sentencing guidelines in re-imposing a sentence greater than the range designated by the guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the second sentencing hearing, the trial court stated that it had considered the sentencing guidelines and the trial court enunciated as reasons for deviating from the guidelines that the victim had taken defendant into his home from off the street and defendant thereafter killed the victim who had helped him. Defendant argued that the 21-year sentence was excessive given that it was three times the term recommended by the sentencing guidelines. On appeal, the court noted that the presentence investigation was not in the record, so the court had to consider the sentence without regard to defendant's juvenile record although the State alluded to prior juvenile offenses. Therefore, without referring to the juvenile record, the court held that, considering the circumstances of the offense and the reasons for sentencing given by the trial court, the trial court adequately provided reasons for the sentence and did not manifestly abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to the maximum sentence of 21 years at hard labor. The sentence was not constitutionally excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment resentencing defendant to 21 years at hard labor after his conviction for manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

The doctor and his insurer agreed to pay the patient the statutory maximum of $ 100,000. The patient filed for approval of the settlement and made a demand for payment of additional amounts from the state patient's compensation fund. The fund opposed the settlement on several ground, including prescription. The trial court sustained the fund's exception of prescription and dismissed the case against the fund. The patient appealed and contended that the fund did not have standing to raise prescription, since under La. Rev. Stat.

The deputy conducted a pat-down search of defendant after defendant started acting fidgety and found a crack pipe. The court affirmed defendant's convictions for possession of cocaine and possession of drug paraphernalia. The trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress. The search that revealed the crack pipe was not an unreasonable warrantless search because the deputy was justified in frisking defendant. Based on an informant's tip the deputy knew defendant was in possession of drugs, as defendant was located in a high drug traffic area and defendant acted nervously when the deputy approached him. The seizure was proper under the &quot;plain feel&quot; exception, as the deputy had knowledge of the object as a crack pipe based upon his past experience. In addition, defendant was not constitutionally deprived of his right to due process by the inclusion in the bill of information of facts concerning his prior convictions because the trial judge gave limiting instructions as required by prior caselaw.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the trial court's decision to credit the fisherman's version of the events was not manifestly erroneous, and left undisturbed its finding that the alleged boating incident did indeed occur, causing the fisherman to experience back pain. The court also held that the trial court did not err in ruling that the Department as surface owner had a duty to warn boaters of the presence of the submerged bulkhead. It further held that where the Department knew of the exact location of the obstacle and that boaters were striking it, and made a conscious and knowing determination to do nothing about the situation, its conduct amounted to a conscious indifference to the danger and that its failure to warn was willful, and it was thus not entitled to the recreational use immunity provided for in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2795. The court also held that there was no manifest error in the trial court's determination that the fisherman was not contributorily negligent. On the issue of damages, the court found that the trial court's conclusion that the accident aggravated the fisherman's pre-existing back condition was not clearly wrong.</SPAN></P>

In affirming the judgment, the court held that because the trial court had considered the Sentencing Guidelines, as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, the trial court had been free to throw the Sentencing Guidelines out the window and impose any sentence within statutory limits, so long as the choice of sentence was backed up by good reasons. The court held that the Sentencing Guidelines did not constrain the trial court's discretion in sentencing. Turning to the merits of the sentence, the court held that the sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive. The court noted that it was only slightly more than the statutory maximum for the offense, and that defendant appeared to be an incorrigible criminal based on a prior marijuana offense and a pending prosecution for another drug offense.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:493 authorized alcoholic regulatory ordinances for the purpose of protection of public health, morals, and safety. The court held that the club owner failed to show that he was irreparably harmed because the ordinance did not close his club but only restricted the consumption of alcohol between certain hours.

The employee also filed a claim for wrongful termination of benefits in the OWC. The OWC hearing officer held that the OWC did not have jurisdiction over the matter, but rather, jurisdiction rested in state court. In response to the employer's appeal, the court affirmed because it found that claims arising prior to July, 1983 were under the jurisdiction of the state district courts. According to the court, the employee's claim arose at the time of his accident in 1981, not at the time payments were stopped. Therefore, the state courts had jurisdiction over the claim.</SPAN></P>

The State claimed that it was illegally lenient because it did not include a fine. The court granted the State's application for a writ to consider whether a trial judge had to impose such a fine where defendant was indigent. The court determined that the language of &sect; 1495.1 mandated a fine, and noted the state's highest court had earlier determined that &sect; 14:95.1 imposed a fine that the trial court had no discretion to waive. Accordingly, the court remanded the case to the trial court for imposition of a fine, reserving to defendant the opportunity to change his plea if it was predicated upon the assurance that no fine would be imposed.</SPAN></P>

The district court also held that defendant was a third felony habitual offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann &sect; 15:529.1 and imposed a 60-year prison sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's attempted murder trial, he was identified by the victim based on a chance encounter at the police station after the crime and another encounter at the courthouse. On appeal, defendant contended that the identification procedures were suggestive and resulted in misidentification. Further, he argued that the district court had considered two improper felony convictions in sentencing him as a habitual offender. The court rejected both arguments, and affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that when immediate and definite identifications result from inadvertent meetings between the victim and the suspect, and there is no indication of impropriety or suggestiveness, an out-of-court identification will be found both reliable and admissible.Rejecting a line of Louisiana cases and adopting the definition of conviction from New Jersey, the court also found that a predicate felony conviction could be used by the district court, although sentence was not imposed in the first case when a second felony was committed, to impose a third felony sentence under the Habitual Offender Law, even if the first two convictions occurred on the same day.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was injured in the course and scope of his employment. Defendants initially paid the employee total disability benefits and supplemental earnings benefits (SEB) at the maximum rate; they then reduced and later terminated the SEB. A hearing officer awarded SEB and total disability benefits with legal interest from the date of judicial demand until paid, penalties, and attorney's fees. On appeal the court amended the judgment in part but otherwise affirmed. The finding that the employee was permanently totally disabled was not manifestly erroneous; however, the amount awarded exceeded the maximum weekly rate of compensation under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1202(A)(2). Because the employee justifiably relied on the representation of an insurance adjuster that his acceptance of retirement benefits would not alter his worker's compensation benefits, defendants were estopped from using the acceptance of retirement benefits as a basis to terminate SEB under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1221(3)(d)(iii). The officer erred in awarding interest from the date of judicial demand; La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1201.3(A) allowed interest from the date of the hearing officer's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended the hearing officer's judgment by decreasing the amount of permanent total disability benefits and to award interest only from the date of the hearing officer's judgment.

Defendant was not shooting into the air or into another direction in order to frighten the people. Although defendant claimed he did not see anyone in front of the club, there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that just prior to the shooting defendant was talking to people standing in front of the club. Next, the court held that defendant's conviction for both, murder and feticide violated double jeopardy because the evidence needed to support the murder conviction was the same for the feticide conviction. The court reversed defendant's feticide conviction and his sentence and found that resentencing was necessary because defendant received life for the murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was employed by corporation, which contracted with defendant company, to remove asbestos insulation from the company's plant. While working plaintiff slipped on a stairwell and brought suit in tort against defendants. Defendants argued plaintiff was limited to worker's compensation remedies because he was a statutory employee, under &sect; 23:1061. The trial court held the removal of asbestos was within the &quot;trade, business, or occupation of defendant&quot; and plaintiff was a statutory employee. Contrary to plaintiff's argument, the court stated prior decisions of the Circuit recognized that certain precedent, which plaintiff relied on, had been legislatively overruled by the 1989 amendment to &sect; 23:1061. The uncontested facts demonstrated plaintiff was entitled to workers compensation benefits. Plaintiff was injured at the plant while in the course and scope of his employment under a contract between his employer and defendant company and the scope of work was directly related to the operation of defendant company's business. The constitutionality of &sect; 23:1061 was not before the court because plaintiff had not properly raised it before the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, which granted defendants' motion for summary judgment in response to plaintiff's action in tort, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He was charged with prescribing various substances to eight of his patients that were in excess of legitimate medical justification in amounts, frequency, and duration, with continuing and recurring medical practice that failed to satisfy the prevailing and accepted standards of medical practice, and with medical incompetency. Expert testimony from another doctor concluded that the doctor had prescribed pain medication without justification; although the dosage given was not excessive, the duration of the medicines prescribed was for too long a period of time. The state medical board found the doctor guilty of all three charges. On appeal the doctor alleged that the evidence presented was insufficient to support the state medical board's decision. The court reversed, holding that there was no reasonable basis in the record for the state medical board's findings that the doctor prescribed legally controlled medicines without legitimate medical justification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individuals sought damages from various defendants and non-resident relator as a result of exposure to asbestos. Liability was premised on exposure to asbestos manufactured by a 1888 manufacturing company. Through a series of mergers and acquisitions, the asbestos manufacturing corporation merged with series of other corporations and transferred liabilities. However, at one point during the process the liabilities were transferred to a subsidiary. The mergers and acquisitions continued, without the subsidiary, and the manufacturing corporation eventually merged with relator's predecessor corporation. Relator argued the trial court erred when it denied relator's exception to personal jurisdiction. After considering the reasoning used by other state courts, the court held the exception should have been granted. The court held relator could not have foreseen being sued in this state to answer for liabilities of a long nonexistent corporation, the business of which had been taken over by a subsidiary that relator never owned. More important, the relator had no contacts in Louisiana from which it availed itself of the privilege of doing business in this state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grandson appealed from the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which issued summary judgment in favor of defendants, the testator's two surviving sons, and dismissed his petition to re-open the succession of his grandmother. The grandson argued that his signing of a receipt for legacy did not constitute a waiver of his rights as a forced heir to assert a claim for his share of the forced portion of the estate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandson was the nephew of the two surviving sons, whose brother had predeceased the testator. Upon receiving his particular legacy of $ 1,000, the grandson signed a receipt for legacy acknowledging his receipt of the $ 1,000 and consented to the rendering of a judgment, placing the residuary legatees into possession of the remainder of the estate. The grandson then sought to re-open the succession and recover the forced portion which was denied his father's estate. The court found that the trial judge was clearly wrong in holding that by signing the receipt of legacy, the grandson had waived any right to assert a claim for his share of the forced portion of his grandmother's estate. As a particular legatee, he was required to execute a receipt for legacy to evidence his receiving the $ 1,000 due him. The receipt served as confirmation that the terms of the will were carried out, insofar as his status as a particular legatee was concerned. The receipt contained no language that could have been reasonably construed as a waiver of any rights he may have had as a forced heir. Absent such language, the court found that the document was a receipt for legacy and nothing more.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment in favor of the testator's sons and remanded the case to the trial court to re-open the succession and to allow the grandson to assert his claims as a forced heir of the estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In August 1983, a driver operating a vehicle owned by his insured employer was attempting to exit a highway at a high rate of speed, when the vehicle turned over and caught fire. In November 1983, the wife and children of an unauthorized guest passenger killed in the accident filed a damages action against the vehicle's insurer. In 1989, an amended petition added a claim against the association, substituted for the insolvent insurer, as an omnibus insurer for the negligent driver. The court denied the association's exception to the amended petition, which changed the insurer's capacity but was brought under the same policy of the insured, because it related back to the timely filing of the original petition that put the insurer on notice of the death claim. The court held that interest was due from the date of that original judicial demand. The court held that retroactively applying the statutory cap on damages would have unconstitutionally divested the plaintiffs of a property right. The court held that the awards for loss of consortium were not an abuse of discretion but were supported by evidence that the children would enter adolescence without their father's support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of a sentence that had been imposed on defendant, as a multiple offender, by the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which sentenced him to 27 years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension on the multiple bill for armed robbery, notwithstanding that it was below the minimum required under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been found guilty of two counts of armed robbery, the offense having occurred while he was on probation for another armed robbery, based on his having robbed two persons while armed with a revolver. Having sentenced and resentenced defendant on several occasions for various reasons, the trial court ultimately sentenced defendant to 27 years at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence on the multiple bill that was below the minimum set by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. The court reversed, stating first that while the trial court had discretion to find that the multiple bill minimum sentence was grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime and constitutionally excessive as to defendant, the statutory minimum should not be deviated from unless it was nothing more than a needless infliction of pain. Here, the court said, the original offense and the offense used for the multiple bill conviction were for armed robberies. Because of the possibility of great bodily harm to the victims, because defendant was armed, and because there no mitigating factors, the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing below the minimum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A customer of a bank invested $ 12 million with a swindler who was running a Ponzi scheme out of a second bank. The customer lost over $ 5 million when the scheme collapsed and the customer brought an action against both banks and the swindler. The jury awarded damages and apportioned them among all parties. The court on appeal found reversible error where the trial court refused a requested jury instruction on &sect; 6:1124 which limited the fiduciary duties of the banks to those contained in any written agreement. The court found the remaining jury instructions misleading and confusing because they permitted liability without the imposition of a duty. The court next found that the jury was incorrectly instructed that a cause of action for aiding and abetting existed under Louisiana law. Finally, the court undertook a de novo review of the record and awarded the banks judgment as a matter of law because they had no duty running to the customer to investigate the Ponzi scheme or to disclose to the customer information about the swindler's account.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When a municipality in November 1991 terminated the worker's compensation benefits a job-injured police officer was receiving as a result of an injury sustained in March 1983, the officer filed a disputed claim with the (OWC). The office's hearing officer granted an exception of lack of subject matter jurisdiction filed by the city, because the accident occurred before the July 1983 date on which the OWC was first created and authorized to handle disputed claims for benefits. On appeal, the officer argued that there was no &quot;claim&quot; for worker's compensation until November 1991, which was the date that the dispute between the parties arose, and, thus, the hearing officer erred in his application of the law. The court agreed, pointing to language in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1310.3, which provided that a &quot;claim&quot; for benefits was initiated by the filing of the appropriate form with the OWC, and not dependent upon the date in which an injury was sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of carnal knowledge of a juvenile, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:80(A)(1). His motion to quash the indictment was denied, and defendant, after reaching a plea agreement with the State, entered a plea of guilty. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, defendant's sentence of five years at hard labor was suspended, and he was placed on five years active supervised probation, with conditions. In affirming the decision, the court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:81 applied to defendant who was over the age of 17 at the time of the offense. After his 17th birthday had passed, he was considered over the age of 17. Further, &sect; 14:80 did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States and Louisiana Constitutions. Any equal protection issue raised by &sect;14:80 was well settled in Louisiana law. Nevertheless, defendant was not given credit for time served, as required by La. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted armed robbery and adjudicated a second felony offender, having a previous conviction for simple burglary. Defendant was sentenced to serve 99 years at hard labor, without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence.

The defendant also contends that his sentence was excessive. The court rejected these arguments and affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that the facts were sufficient to establish that defendant committed all the essential elements of the offense of attempted armed robbery. Further, the prosecution established that defendant was a second felony offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 15:529.1.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the First Judicial District Court for the Parish of Caddo Louisiana, which convicted him of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967A(1), as charged by the state by bill of information. The state subsequently charged defendant as a third felony offender pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, to which he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer saw defendant selling drugs. The officer did not arrest defendant, but continued to patrol the area over the next several days. The officer also warned defendant that the police were watching him. Subsequently, the officer returned with other officers in an &quot;organized routine patrol strike&quot; to conduct field interviews and an investigation. Defendant ran, and several officers pursued. One officer picked up a matchbox that he saw defendant drop. It contained 4.4 grams of cocaine, an amount that was consistent with usage for distribution purposes. Based on the facts, the court concluded that the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress the cocaine. Further, defendant did not argue adequate grounds to quash the bill of information under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 532 and 534. Additionally, the evidence was sufficient for the state to conclude that defendant sold crack cocaine for a living and to present this conclusion to the jury in closing argument. Further, the sentence was not excessive because once defendant achieved the status of third felony offender, the trial court lacked discretion and was mandated to impose a life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of the trial court that convicted defendant of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and with being a third felony offender as charged by the state. The court also affirmed the life sentence that the trial court rendered against defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant complained of his conviction by the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), for possession of 28 or more but less than 200 grams of cocaine. At trial, defendant admitted that the cocaine belonged to him. On appeal, he challenged the validity of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F)(1)(a), as well as the sufficiency of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F)(1)(a) did not criminalize non-criminal activity; one was not subject to criminal prosecution for possessing a non-controlled substance as long as it did not contain a detectable amount of cocaine. The court held, too, that &sect; 40:967(F)(1)(a) did not violate equal protection. Hypothetical cases of unequal treatment depending on the amount of pure cocaine and the amount of the non-controlled substance were irrelevant because constitutional challenges could not be based on hypothetical situations. Defendant did not sustain his burden of proving that the classification contained in &sect; 40:967(F)(1)(a) was without a rational basis. The provision constituted an appropriate exercise of police power and furthered a legitimate state purpose. The statute described the unlawful conduct, possession of cocaine, with sufficient clarity that persons of reasonable intelligence were capable of discerning its meaning and conforming their conduct to it. Defendant admitted the cocaine belonged to him, and a criminalist testified that the powder contained cocaine and weighed 58 grams. Thus, the State proved defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant priest waived his attorney-client privilege so that his former attorney could testify at a hearing on a motion to quash the bill of information charging defendant with possession of child pornography.

Defendant filed a motion to suppress his statements to his former attorney and the trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the prosecution argued that defendant had made an unlimited waiver of the attorney-client privilege when he permitted his former attorney to testify at the hearing on the motion to quash the bill of information. The appellate court, in affirming the decision of the trial court, held that the record supported the conclusion that defendant's waiver of the attorney-client privilege was intended to be limited to the hearing on the motion to quash.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother took the minor child and travelled across the country by way of shelters for battered women. The minor child was returned to Louisiana. Because it was impractical for the trial court to award joint custody, because the mother lived in Montana, the trial court awarded the father sole custody. The judgment was appealed and reversed and remanded for retrial. The Act was enacted, and the trial court held that the Act established new rules, rights, and duties which related to relief from family violence when the family was separated and did not apply retroactively. The mother sought supervisory review of that ruling. The court stated the legislature expressed no intent as to whether the statutes encompassed by the Act were retroactively applicable, but the preamble to the Act clearly indicated that the statute was remedial in nature. The court granted the supervisory writ and held that the Act was applicable to the parties' case. The court took particular notice of certain provisions of the Act, which were applicable to the action between the parties.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee stopped working as a dental assistant due to endometriosis. She later developed pain in her hands and was told she suffered from carpal tunnel syndrome. She filed a worker's compensation claim against her former employer, alleging that her disability was the result of a work-related injury. The administrative law judge rejected her claim. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because the employee had worked for her employer for less than 12 months, she was required to prove that her occupational disease was contracted during the course of her employment by an overwhelming preponderance of the evidence pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1031.1(D). The employee did not meet her burden of proof. There were discrepancies in her testimony as to when the complaints of pain actually began. She never mentioned the pain to a doctor who treated her while she was still employed and her medical records from a visit to the hospital prior to the termination of her employment did not mention pain in her wrists. The court refused to address the issue of whether &sect; 23:1031.1 was unconstitutional because the employee did not plead that issue at the trial court level.</SPAN></P>

The district court vacated the Board's denial and remanded the matter with instructions. The Board sought review of the district court's judgment. The court reversed that judgment because it found that the district court had no jurisdiction over the matter. According to the court, because there was no statutory or constitutional requirement mandating that the Board's determination be made after hearing with notice, judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:964, was not available. The court also found that there was no original jurisdiction on the part of the district court because the action did not involve constitutional questions or excess of authority claims. And, according to the court, the regulation of ad valorem tax exemptions was not a civil matter within the meaning of La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(A).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the two corporations involved in the appeal, along with other defendants, constituted a single business enterprise (SBE) under the control of an individual. The trial court enjoined the two corporations from disposing of any assets and records and ordered them to deliver all their assets to the commissioner of insurance. The court affirmed. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:731 et seq., the commissioner was authorized to use summary proceedings in a liquidation proceeding. The corporations were not entitled to a jury trial because a trial by jury was not available for summary proceedings. The commissioner was not required to show irreparable harm because the injunction was issued pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:734, which specifically provided for an injunction as a remedy in a liquidation proceeding to restrain persons from disposing of property. The trial court properly determined that the corporations were part of an SBE controlled by one individual. The individual was in control of most of the corporations, they were minimally capitalized and nearly all went out of business after the individual severed his relationship with them.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father filed a lawsuit attacking the constitutionality of the Children's Code, alleging that La. Child Code arts. 1137 and 1138 were unconstitutional because they deprived him of equal protection and due process. He contended that he was not served with notice of the mother's surrender of the child, in violation of La. Child Code art. 1133 and was, therefore, entitled to damages from the unlawful surrender. The trial court sustained an exception of no cause of action. The court affirmed, finding that the lawsuit represented an impermissible collateral attack on the judgment of the juvenile court terminating his parental rights. The father challenged the constitutionality of the provisions which required a juvenile court to terminate an alleged father's parental rights in the course of an adoption proceeding where he failed to establish parental rights. The issue of the constitutionality of the challenged provisions was clearly a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the juvenile court. There was no legal impediment to prevent the father from raising the constitutional issues in the juvenile court and the appeal represented a collateral attack on the prior judgment.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner contended that his ineligibility to earn a diminution of his sentence under &sect; 15:571.3(C) because he was a habitual offender deprived him of equal protection of the laws and subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner was ineligible for &quot;good time&quot; because he was a habitual offender, as defined in La. Rev.

Ann. &sect; 15:571.3(C) because other prisoners who committed more serious crimes were eligible for good time credits. Affirming the trial court's dismissal, the court rejected his equal protection challenge under La. Const. art.

The prisoner's sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20, or U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tax centralization commission appealed from the judgment of the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court for the Parish of Washington (Louisiana), which held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2544.1D was constitutional, declared that the commission's acceptance of the sheriff's proposal was invalid, enjoined an award to the sheriff, and ordered the commission to enter into a contract with plaintiff city to serve as the tax collecting agent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 33:2544.1 was enacted without the notice of intent to introduce the bill or publication in an official state journal. When the parish's taxing bodies could not agree on a central tax collector for the parish, the commission was formed. The commission members agreed to proceed under a one member-one vote basis instead of the weighted vote scheme that was set forth under &sect; 33:2544.1D. The commission requested bids, and a majority of the commission agreed to accept the sheriff's proposal to collect the taxes. Had the votes been weighted, the city's proposal would have been accepted. The commission adopted a resolution to accept the sheriff's proposal to serve as the collection agent. The court found that the legislature fulfilled its mandate under La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 3(B)(1) by enacting La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2844.1A. Reversing the trial court's judgment, the court held that &sect; 33:2544.1D was unconstitutional because the mandated notification requirements of La. Const. art. III, &sect; 13 were not met, and it was clearly a local law. The court found no reasonable basis for the legislature's decision to determine legislatively the weight to be accorded the commission's votes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and held that the contested and severable section of the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent intervenor, the state legislature, sought review of an order of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana), which entered judgment in favor of petitioner citizen and petitioner intervenors, a fishing association and an environmental group, in their action for mandamus seeking an order directing respondent, the state wildlife and fisheries commission, to enforce the trout management plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state wildlife and fisheries commission adopted a trout management plan that among other things prohibited weekend commercial taking of spotted sea trout. Subsequently the legislature adopted a concurrent resolution nullifying the weekend commercial portion of the trout plan. Petitioners sought an order directing enforcement of the trout plan including the weekend prohibition; they sought to compel performance of a public duty. The trial court found that the trout plan was valid and the concurrent resolution was invalid, and made the writ of mandamus peremptory. The legislature alleged several errors by the trial court including denying their peremptory exception and finding that petitioner had a right of action to compel an agency to enforce a rule, when that rule had general application and petitioners had no special interest, distinct from the public at large, in its enforcement. The court held that while all citizens had an interest in the public trusts of the state's various natural resources, no one citizen or citizen group had a special interest beyond that enjoyed by the general public. The court found that petitioners lacked standing to maintain an action for mandamus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court in favor of the citizen making peremptory the writ of mandamus.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped on a bridge by a police officer. The officer noticed that defendant's license tag had expired.

The officer then discovered that defendant was on probation for possession of cocaine. Defendant was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm and sentenced to five years at hard labor. On appeal defendant alleged that the State impermissibly exercised it peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors based on their race and was therefor entitled to a new trial. On appeal the court held that considering the fact that 11 of the 12 peremptory challenges were African-American and that the lower court requested race-neutral reasons from the State, that defendant had proved a prima facie case of discrimination. However, the court determined that after reviewing the State's reasons, coupled with the fact that 8 of the 12 members of the jury were African-American, the trial court had not erred when it denied his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

In addition, the tenant argued that the trial court's eviction violated her due process rights. The court affirmed and stated that there was no constitutional right to public housing. Because the lease provisions provided for the eviction of any tenant with drugs in their apartment and that tenants were presumed to have control over guests, the court held that the eviction was proper. The housing authority's policy of zero tolerance to drugs on the premises was not unreasonable, nor were the lease provisions in question unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city appealed a judgment from the 16th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Iberia (Louisiana). The trial court ordered the city to pay plaintiff employees, with the exception of one employee, for accumulated sick leave. The trial court also awarded attorney fees to the prevailing employees but dismissed their claim for penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City employees filed an action to be compensated for the unused sick leave each had accumulated prior to January 1, 1991. One employee also sought payment for sick leave that he alleged had accumulated after January 1, 1991. The trial court rejected the latter employee's claims but ordered the city to pay the other employees for the sick leave in dispute. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The trial court committed error in awarding payment for sick leave that had accumulated prior to January 1, 1991. A new civil rule that allowed employees to be paid for accumulated sick leave, although enacted prior to January 1, 1991, had not become effective until January 1, 1991. Prior to January 1, 1991, an employee had no right to payment for unused sick leave. The court rejected the trial court's finding that payment for sick leave accumulated prior to the effective date of the rule was not a retroactive application of the rule but was simply a different method of compensating an employee for a right already earned. An award of the sick leave accumulated prior to the rule change would constitute a retroactive increase in pay prohibited by La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 14(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment to the extent that it awarded payment for sick leave accumulated prior to January 1, 1991 and to the extent that it awarded attorney fees to the prevailing employees. The court otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted of sending threatening letters to a former girlfriend who was set to testify against him on extortion charges and to her daughter. The defendant argued that certain statements in the letters which referred to his criminal past and his criminal history should have been redacted by the trial court because they were inadmissible under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 404(B)(1). He argued that they did not establish motive, opportunity, intent, nor were they an integral part of the crime of intimidation. The court held that the letters were properly offered because they tended to prove the res gestae of the offense of intimidation. The court held that the defendant failed to preserve claims that his sentence was excessive because he did not set forth specific grounds in his motion to reconsider under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 881.1 and found that it was not unconstitutionally excessive, pursuant to La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The court found that only one count of the multi-count indictment could be used to enhance the defendant's sentence under La. Rev. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his co-conspirator appealed their convictions for conspiracy to commit first degree murder from the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Division F (Louisiana). They also challenged their sentences and adjudications as multiple offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were based on evidence that defendant enlisted the help of the co-conspirator for the purposes of killing his former supervisor and the superintendent of schools. The co-conspirator sought the assistance of another individual about the plan, and that individual notified the police. An undercover investigation ensued, resulting in the arrest and convictions. Both defendants raised numerous errors on appeal. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting hearsay statements made by the co-conspirator into evidence at the pre-trial hearing for the purposes of determining whether a prima facie case of conspiracy had been established. The admission of certain audio and videotapes generated during the course of the investigation were admissible to show defendants' intent, as well as furtherance of the conspiracy. The prosecution's was not obligated to disclose a potentially exculpatory statement of a witness where the defense was aware of the witness prior to trial, and where the defense did not make either a general or a specific request for the statements of all confidential informants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant and his co-conspirator's sentences.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was not charged with making any false statements or false attribution. The State contended that defendant failed to show a substantial likelihood of a significant inhibitory effect upon valid expression. In reversing the trial court's ruling, the court held that the right to distribute anonymous campaign literature was clearly protected by U.S. Const. amend. I and La. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 5 and 7. Accordingly, the court declared La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18:1463(C)(3) to be an unconstitutional restraint on the constitutional rights of freedom of expression and the right to privacy. The court stated that defendant did not have the burden to show a significant inhibitory effect of the statute, but rather, the State had the burden to demonstrate a compelling interest to justify the restraints upon the protected freedom of expression, and to show that the limitation was no greater than necessary to protect such interest. The court noted that as a practical matter, anonymous campaign literature might be the only way, for example, that unclassified government employees would be able to express political views without risking the loss of their jobs.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed that the large quantity of drugs to be likely distributed to a large amount of people, defendant's age, defendant's prior conviction, and the fact that defendant was to be paid for his services all merited a severe sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant chased the children, fatally shooting one child. Defendant was tried as an adult and convicted of two counts of second-degree murder. His sentence was for life without parole. On appeal, defendant contended that the statutory scheme for treating as adults those juveniles accused of certain crimes, La. Ch. Code Ann. art. 305(B), was unconstitutional because it denied him the opportunity, at any stage of the proceedings, to assert his youth in order to show that he was less culpable than an adult. The court noted that the statute reflected the legislature's determination that those persons 15 and older were of sufficient understanding to be tried as adults for certain serious crimes such as second-degree murder. According to the court, this scheme did not violate any constitutional rights on its face, or as applied against defendant. The court also held that, given the nature of the crime, the sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of forcible rape in 1989 and sentenced to five years hard labor. The sentence was suspended and he was placed on active probation. In 1993, his probation was revoked and the original sentence was imposed. Two years later, he was released on good time credit. It was stipulated that he was released as if on parole and was ordered to register as a sex offender under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 15:542, 15:574.4. The trial court denied defendant's petition challenging the requirement that he register as a sex offender. The court affirmed, rejecting defendant's contention that the statutory requirements of the sexual offender registration law did not apply to him because they were not effective until after his date of conviction. The court held that the legislature clearly intended that the statute apply to all persons convicted of sex offenses before the statute was enacted. Furthermore, the court noted that defendant was ordered to register under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:574.4 which made registration applicable to parol requirements. Because that law was in effect at the time he was paroled, he was subject to its application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The son was injured when he was assaulted outside a movie theater. The parents alleged that the doctor failed to properly treat the son's head injuries and as a result the son suffered irreversible brain damage. The parents and son challenged the constitutionality of the Medical Malpractice Act (Act), which limited the recovery of a patient against a doctor. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that it was bound by the Louisiana Supreme Court's decision, which found that the Act was constitutional. The court stated that it was not free to overrule the decision of the highest state court. However, the court found that the dismissal of the parents and son's suit was error. A declaratory judgment was the appropriate remedy for the parents and son to challenge the constitutionality of the Act. The court could not force the parents and son to accept the doctor's tender where there was no settlement because such an action would preclude any further relief. The parents and son were entitled to a final ruling on the constitutionality of their claims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment holding that the Medical Malpractice Act was constitutional and vacated the judgment dismissing the suit against the doctor.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the association's appeal and found that its application for supervisory writs under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1142A was the appropriate vehicle to challenge the commission's advisory opinions. The court held that the association, despite any language contained in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22:1380 that it was not a state agency, was a state agency within the contemplation of the Ethics Code. The association was a creation of the legislature, which specifically defined its powers, and subjected it to the oversight of the Commissioner of Insurance. The association's property, which was derived from mandatory tax assessments upon all insurers, was transferred into the state general fund.

The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2800 allowing the victims to sue the agency was beyond the legislature's authority because the statute imposed more stringent requirements on plaintiffs who sued state entities over prove entities. The court also determined that because the trial court made a manifestly erroneous by failing to address the constitutionality of &sect; 9:2800, it would review the case de novo. The court stated that under the facts of the case, the agency was strictly liable for the accident, due to the defective condition of the traffic light.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Fourteenth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Calcasieu (Louisiana), which denied defendant's motion to reconsider his sentence. Upon a plea of guilty to manslaughter, the trial court had sentenced defendant to 20 years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was standing in the street in front of his house with some friends. The victim drove by, stopped, and asked about an individual and for money. Defendant stated that the victim appeared angry and seemed to be reaching for a weapon. Defendant took out his gun and shot the victim. Defendant entered a plea of guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to 20 years at hard labor. The trial court denied his motion for reconsideration of sentence. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, finding that the trial court stated the factual basis for defendant's sentence and the factors that were weighed in fashioning the sentence and that these factors were supported by the record. The court found that defendant's crime was a violent and serious offense and his victim's actions did not justify homicide. The court noted that by pleading guilty to manslaughter, rather than going to trial on the second degree murder charge, defendant escaped a potential sentence of mandatory life imprisonment. The court found that the sentence imposed was not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime, even though this was defendant's first conviction.</SPAN></P>

The two defendants were indicted on one count and two counts of jury tampering, respectively. The trial court, by jury verdict, found both defendants guilty of attempted jury tampering. The trial court denied their motions for a new trial and for arrest of judgment. Defendants contended that the verdict was not responsive to the indictment, as the crime of &quot;attempted jury tampering&quot; did not exist.

The company sought in its motion for summary judgment a dismissal of the individuals' claims on the grounds that the company was one of the individuals' statutory employer at the time of his accident and was therefore immune from tort liability. The court agreed with the trial court. The court found that the motion for summary judgment struck down the entirety of the individuals' case upon a finding that the company, as the statutory employer, was immune from any tort liability.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The principal was serving under a two-year contract commencing in 1990. In 1992, the superintendent recommended that the principal's contract be renewed but that a formal reprimand be placed in his personnel file regarding an incident involving grade changing. However, the school board voted not to renew the principal's contract and notified the principal of their decision by letter. The trial court ruled that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:444(B)(c)(iii) and (iv), which became effective in 1991, was applicable to the case. The court affirmed on appeal, holding that the legislature expressly provided for the statute's retroactive application. The statute required that the principal be informed of the written charges and given a fair hearing before the board after reasonable notice. The court found that there were no written charges and no written notice to the principal of any hearing on any charges. The board did not comply with the mandates of the statute and, therefore, there were no issues of material fact that would preclude summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 and sentenced him to serve 20 years at hard labor. The underlying crime was the theft of property valued between $ 100 and $ 500.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The multiple bill proceeding was conducted the day after defendant was sentenced to serve two years for the crime of theft.

The court found that there was no delay attributable to the State or to the trial court relative to the filing of the multiple bill, the adjudication, or the sentencing. Further, defendant knew the State intended to multiple bill him, so he could not have reasonably expected that he would be released on the charge without the imposition of an enhanced penalty. The court also found that the trial judge had not abused his discretion by refusing to charge the theft trial jury on the multiple offender sentence because the State had not yet proved the allegations for multiple offender sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction of armed robbery, defendant was sentenced to 99 years at hard labor. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence and asserted that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress a one-on-one identification by the victim at the crash scene because it was highly suggestive. The court disagreed and held that the identification was justified by the overall circumstances because defendant was apprehended within a relatively short time after the crime was committed. Defendant also contended that the sentence imposed was excessive. The court noted that the sentence imposed was within the statutory limit and held that the record and facts of the case supported the sentence because defendant was a second felony offender. Finally, defendant argued that the trial court improperly charged the jury by telling them not to come back with a mistrial verdict.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A couple separated in 1978 and partitioned the community with the exception of the wife's pension plan. The couple later reconciled but separated again in 1992. After a couple divorced in 1993, they entered into a consent judgment of partition of the community property. However, they disagreed as to the nature of the ex-wife's pension plan following the 1978 reconciliation and before the final divorce decree. The trial judge determined that the marital community property regime was not reestablished at the time of the 1978 reconciliation and denied the ex-husband's claim for a portion of his ex-wife's pension plan beyond 1978. On appeal, the ex-husband argued that, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:384, the community was reestablished in 1978. The appellate court agreed because it found that the legislature clearly intended &sect; 9:384 to have retroactive application.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims' boat sank when it struck the piling of an abandoned oil well. The oil well was owned by the oil company. The oil company challenged the finding of negligence. One of the victims's challenged the trial court's failure to award him medical expenses for surgery. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and amended the case. The court held that under the general maritime law, a party's negligence was actionable only if it was a legal cause of victim's injuries. Legal cause required that the negligence be a substantial factor in the injury. The oil company was negligent in leaving the pilings and well casing protruding out of the water. The pilings constituted an obstacle to navigation and were a substantial factor in causing the victims' accident. If the oil company had cut the casing and removed or cut the pilings to the mud line, or, at a minimum, marked the pilings with reflectors, the accident could have been avoided. Next, the court held that an injured victim could not be faulted for accepting a course of treatment offered by his orthopedic surgeon, which was offered as a means of reducing his pain. There was no evidence that the injured victim acted in bad faith.</SPAN></P>

Defendants were convicted of the negligent homicide of the passenger in the driver's car. The court held that the verdict was supported by sufficient evidence that defendants grossly deviated from the standard of care when they chased another driver in a threatening manner and at a high rate of speed, which chase was a contributing factor to the death. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting rehabilitative and rebuttal evidence, a color photograph of the victim's body, evidence to which no objection was made, and testimony of excited utterances made by the driver while he was still under the stress of the accident. The admission of hearsay testimony that unnamed witnesses at the scene said they did not hear screeching tires was harmless error because it was corroborated by other witnesses. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing charges that were not wholly correct or were included in the general instruction or in imposing a three-year hard labor sentence for the defendant who had prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

The city filed a reconventional demand requesting an injunction prohibiting issuance of the license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city issued a temporary permit to the applicants so that they could obtain a zoning variance that would enable them to operate a nightclub in an area zoned for packaged liquor sales only. After the city failed to render a decision within 35 days of the request under La. Rev. Stat. Ann &sect; 26:87, the applicants were granted an injunction ordering the city to issue a formal permit. On review, the city argued that the district court could not compel the city to violate its own zoning ordinances under &sect; 26:87. The applicants contended that the zoning ordinance denied them due process of law and that the city was estopped from denial under &sect; 26:87. The court rejected both arguments and reversed the judgment. The court held that the only remedy available under &sect; 26:87 was to compel the city to rule on the application for a permit, and the district court had no authority to compel the city to violate its own laws. The court found that no due process violation had occurred because other nightclubs had been grandfathered in after the ordinance was passed. The court found that the city was entitled to an injunction to enforce its zoning law prohibiting the operation of the nightclub.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimant, a parish attorney, was convicted of three felonies and applied for disability retirement benefits before retiring. The Board of Trustees for the Employees' Retirement System denied him benefits. The trial court dismissed his suit. The claimant appealed and the court affirmed. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:1411 provided that the conviction for a felony of a public officer would suspend him from office without compensation. The claimant argued that he was not a public officer. An individual was a public officer if he acted as an agent of the state and the office occupied involved a large degree of independence in which the individual was not under the direct supervision of an employer. The claimant was a public officer because his office enjoyed a large degree of independence and was not subject to his employer's control. The claimant asserted that &sect; 42:1411 was not applicable because his retirement benefits were not an emolument of his office. The court rejected his claim that the Board dispossessed him of a vested right. The disability retirement benefits were distinguishable from the mandatory contributions he made into the retirement system.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2442(C), contending that the trial court erred in finding that the testator could read, and that the will was properly witnessed and executed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to his death, the decedent executed a statutory will. He had previously been disabled and the right side of his body was paralyzed. The will was drafted by his attorney in accordance with &sect; 9:2442(C), and disinherited the decedent's child, the will opponent. The opponent filed a challenge to the probation of the will, contending that after the stroke, his father could not read, and that the testamentary formalities were not met by the decedent's signature on each page, as opposed to his mark. The court dispensed with the formality challenge, holding that the purpose of the statute was that the testator at least affix a mark to each page because he was physically unable to read, and the signature on each page satisfied the general requirement. The main issue was whether sufficient evidence showed that the decedent could read after his stroke. Testimony included that of his friends and relatives that he could read, and the court affirmed the trial court's finding that the decedent met the capacity requirement. The court held that the findings of capacity and formality were sufficiently supported and affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner state sought review of an order of the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana), which, in the state's action for declaratory judgment, upheld rulings that ceilings in favor of the state on non-economic damages and pre-judgment interest limitations were unconstitutional, and found that all payments made by the state on judgments must be imputed first to legal interest and then to principal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court ruled that Rick v. State, Department of Transportation and Development, 630 So. 2d 1271 (La. 1994) applied to all judgments that had not been satisfied at the time Rick had been rendered, that Chamberlain v. State, Department of Transportation and Development, 624 So. 2d 874 (La. 1993) applied to respondent judgment creditor's general damage award, and that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1866 required that all payments made by the state on judgments must be imputed first to legal interest and then to the principal. In light of the substantial injustices that would result from a retroactive application, the court concluded that Chamberlain and Rick should not be applied retroactively, but prospectively only. The court applied the holdings of Chamberlain and Rick to those cases that were still &quot;pending appeal&quot; at the time the judgments were rendered and rejected the argument that a judgment was &quot;pending&quot; until satisfied by payment in full. The court held that the supreme court's holdings in Chamberlain and Rick would be applied to those cases in which a final judgment had not yet been obtained on the dates the decisions were rendered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court to the extent it applied the holding in Rick v. State, 630 So. 2d 1271 (La. 1994), to all judgments that had not been satisfied at the time of the rendition of Rick.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant putative father appealed the judgment of the Sixteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of St. Mary, Louisiana which in an paternity action held in favor of Plaintiff State and intervenor mother and awarded child support and reimbursement to the State for Aid For Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits paid the mother.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a paternity action the trial judge entered judgment establishing paternity and ordered the father to pay child support and to reimburse the State for AFDC benefits which had been paid to the mother. The father appealed contending inter alia that the statutory scheme of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:397 et seq., as applied, resulted in a denial of due process, because it required the filing of the expert reports, which contain statistical opinions unequivocally prejudicial to the father, into the record without an adequate opportunity for the father to test the validity of the expert opinions rendered. The court found that the father was provided with an opportunity at trial to refute the test result, to question the expert's opinions and qualifications, and to explore the testing methodology used. The father's entire defense relied on the correctness of the calculations made by one of the expert witnesses as to the probable date conception occurred; and because the date of conception was not conclusively established, the court could not find that the trial judge was clearly wrong in his finding that the father had access to the mother at or about the probable time of conception.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial in a paternity action which found in favor of the State and the mother against the putative father.</SPAN></P>

Crim. Code Ann. art. 163.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The agents secured a search warrant authorizing a search of the residence where defendant and his grandparents lived. They arrived before dark to execute the warrant. They called the residence and were told by an elderly woman that defendant was not at home. The agents sent up surveillance and after waiting for several hours decided to execute the warrant before the grandparents turned off the lights. At about 9:00 p.m. they knocked on the door, showed the grandmother the warrant, and asked to wait inside for defendant. Defendant arrived home at 9:30, was shown the warrant and advised of his rights, and agreed to go with one of the agents to his bedroom to get the marijuana. The trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence on the grounds that the warrant was executed at nighttime in violation of art. 163. On appeal by writ of certiorari, the court denied the motion to suppress. The court held that although the warrant was executed at nighttime without the authorization required by art. 163, the search was not unconstitutional. The exclusionary rule did not apply and suppression was not required because the search was not unreasonable under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The defendants countered that the employee's exclusive remedy was workers compensation because the joint venturers were statutory employers. The trial court sustained the defense and granted summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that it was clear that, at the time of his injuries, the employee was performing work in furtherance of the joint venture, namely the installation of the door to the boiler, which was part of the boiler construction project, and that this fact created a statutory employment relationship for purposes of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner national bank organized petitioner insurance subsidiary for the purpose of selling insurance. Respondent state commissioner of insurance revoked petitioner's license to sell insurance pursuant to state law making it illegal for a bank or its subsidiary to sell any insurance except credit life insurance. The court affirmed the revocation of petitioner's license. The court held that the state law was not preempted by a federal law, 12 U.S.C.S. &sect; 92, that authorized national banks in small towns to sell insurance. The court held that while the two statutes were facially conflicting, the McCarran-Ferguson Act (McCarran Act), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1012(b), saved the state law from preemption. Under the McCarran Act, the court held that state laws enacted for the purpose of regulating insurance were not subject to preemption unless the conflicting federal law clearly stated that it regulated insurance or was intended to preempt state law. Under this analysis, the court concluded that the federal statute that merely granted power for national banks to sell insurance did not entail regulation of that activity, and thus was subject to &quot;reverse preemption&quot; by the state law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant asserted that the instruction was prejudicial error because the crime of attempted manslaughter was a specific intent crime. The court affirmed and found that in the conference regarding the proposed jury charges, the trial court stated that it would define attempt first, and then define attempted manslaughter. The court found that defendant's counsel agreed with the trial court's intended charges, but when the charge was delivered to the jury, it had changed to include the objected to statement. Upon request by the jury, the trial court repeated the same definition of attempted manslaughter.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a municipal association executive director and mayors as representatives of the class of individuals residing in the incorporated municipalities in the parish who paid the gasoline sales tax imposed by defendant State of Louisiana, challenged the grant by the 27th Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. Landry, Louisiana, of an exception of no cause of action in favor of both the State and defendant parish police jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class alleged that the parish police jury arbitrarily denied the incorporated municipalities the right to share in the Parish Transportation Fund Act revenues. That the Parish Transportation Fund Act treated incorporated municipalities in a different manner than it treated the unincorporated areas was not a constitutional violation, and did not violate the class's equal rights, because the distinction was not based on a &quot;suspect classification&quot; such as race or religion. The legislation was merely a rational and appropriate method for providing funds to the citizens of the parish through its parish government, for the maintenance and construction of parish roads and if desired, the same expenditure on the roads located in incorporated municipalities. The court did, however, find that the class action stated a cause of action against the parish police jury. Based on the well-pleaded allegations of fact, a claim was established for an abuse of discretion granted under the Parish Transportation Fund Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:755(A), and for a possible violation of its administrative procedures, by the parish police jury in its method of appropriation of the fund.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court granting the exception of no cause of action on behalf of the State of Louisiana, but reversed the judgment granting the exception of no cause of action on behalf of the St. Landry Parish Police Jury, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed arguing that the trial court erred in the sentencing and should have articulated its reasons for deviating from the mandated sentence. On review the court noted if a sentence meted out under &sect; 15:529.1 made no measurable contribution to the acceptable goals of punishment, or was grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime, it was the duty of the sentencing judge to reduce the sentence to one that would not be constitutionally excessive.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of three counts of armed robbery after he robbed the players at a dice game of their cash and jewelry. Defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to 17 1/2 years at hard labor. The State appealed and the court affirmed. The State argued that the trial court erred in failing to sentence defendant to the statutory minimum of 33 years mandated by the habitual offender statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. The court held that the sentencing court could find that the statutorily mandated minimum sentence under the Habitual Offender Law was unconstitutionally excessive and impose a lesser sentence. The trial judge had to find that the punishment mandated by &sect; 15:529.1 made no measurable contribution to acceptable goals of punishment or that it amounted to nothing more than the purposeful imposition of pain and suffering. The court concluded that the trial court justified its departure from the mandatory minimum sentence by acknowledging that defendant's youth, the facts of the case, and the fact that his two prior convictions were for shoplifting did not justify the statutorily mandated minimum sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38:333, which required the sharing of these funds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38:333 created two new levee districts, so that there were a total of four. Defendant and a preexisting second levee district were required to share funds with the newly created plaintiff and a fourth district. The purpose of &sect; 38:333 was to partially relieve defendant and the second levee district of the responsibility for providing certain services to areas where the four districts overlapped. Defendant refused to transfer funds to plaintiff, arguing that &sect; 38:333 arbitrarily subjected persons within the overlap to oppressive double taxation and that it could impair defendant's contractual obligations. Although there was no specific authority to overlap districts, there was no express provision limiting the legislature, which did have express authority to consolidate, divide, reorganize, or create new levee districts under La. Const. art. III, &sect; 13. The legislature was aware of the overlap when it enacted &sect; 38:333. The language and purpose were clear. There was no proof of any unfair taxation, possible contract disturbance, or endangerment of bonded indebtedness. Defendant did not prove that the statute was unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the district court with the costs of the appeal taxed to defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insured sustained injuries as a result of an accident involving a train which struck a tractor trailer rig driven by the insured. The insured, as the spouse of an employee of a hospital, filed insurance claims for coverage under the hospital's self-funded health insurance plan for the medical expenses he incurred from his injuries. The insurer hospital declined coverage on the basis that the insured was acting within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the accident and thus his claim was subject to an exclusion contained in the policy, which excluded from coverage medical expenses resulting from injury arising out of or in the course of employment. The trial court granted the insurer's motion for summary judgment, which was unopposed, and later denied a motion for a new hearing after the insured claimed that it had not received notice of the hearing on the motion for summary judgment. In affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that the insured's evidence to support its assertion that the insurer was acting within the course of his employment at the time of the accident was sufficient to meet its burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for the distribution of cocaine.

The court found that after considering defendant's prior conviction, the maximum range recommended by the sentencing guidelines was 84 months. Defendant's sentence of 240 months was thus nearly 3 times the recommended maximum sentence. Further the court concluded that the notice contained in the record and the predicate for admission presented by the State were sufficient to allow the State to admit the defendant's inculpatory statement into evidence, and the evidence sufficiently supported the conviction for distribution of cocaine.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wife appealed a judgment of the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita (Louisiana), which designated plaintiff, her estranged husband, as the primary domiciliary parent of their two minor children. The wife complained that the district court refused to apply the adverse presumption, enunciated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:364(A), concerning any parent with a history of perpetrating family violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife alleged that the district court erroneously failed to apply the presumption enunciated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:364(A) and, accordingly, erroneously designated her estranged husband as the primary domiciliary parent of their children. Nothing indicated that the husband ever directed any anger toward the children. Thus, after viewing the totality of circumstances in light of the children's best interest, the fact-trier found only occasional incidents of violence that might have been provoked by the wife's adultery, and that did not rise to the level of a &quot;history of perpetrating family violence.&quot; Accordingly, the court held that there was no manifest error in the refusal to apply the presumption. The evidence of the husband's behavior did not warrant the harsh remedy discussed. The court found that although both parties were generally shown to be good and loving parents, the totality of the circumstances favored the husband. He clearly established a more secure environment for the children. In contrast, the wife's present situation and relevant past did not present a stable situation.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the statements were properly admitted for the purpose of explaining the sequence of events that took place prior to the arrest of the defendant when police officers were conducting their investigation. The court found that the 40-year sentence imposed on the defendant was excessive and an abuse of discretion. The court found that the trial court did not adequately explain its reasons for imposing the maximum allowable sentence on the defendant. The court held that the sentence, when measured against precedents and the recommendations of the Sentencing Commission Guidelines was excessive under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 and La. Code Crim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers filed an action against the department to recover severance taxes paid under protest. They claimed that the Louisiana Severance Tax Statutes were unconstitutional as applied to oil and gas production from a federal enclave. The department filed a reconventional demand for severance taxes. The trial court dismissed the taxpayers' action, granted the department's reconventional demand, and ruled that the statutes were valid and enforceable. On appeal, the court held that the La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:633 amendment rendered the severance tax an income tax within the meaning of the Buck Act, 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 106, therefore the department could impose the severance tax on the minerals severed from the federal enclave. The court concluded that the severance tax on natural gas and its equivalents remained a volume-based tax for the determination of the amount of tax due. The court ruled that the Louisiana Severance Tax, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 37:631-646, could be imposed because of the amendment to the Mineral Leasing Act for Acquired Lands, 30 U.S.C.S. &sect; 357.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by bill of information with molestation of a juvenile. Defendant filed a motion to quash based on expiration of the time limitation to prosecute. The trial court granted the motion and the prosecution appealed. The court held that the trial court erred by finding that the four-year prescriptive period under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 572 had run and that an exception provided in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 573 was not applicable. At the time the offense was allegedly committed, art. 573 did not provide an exception to the four-year time limitation for molestation of a juvenile, but that exception was added before the four-year limitation under art. 572 had expired. The court held that the right against prosecution had not vested because the time limitation had not run when the amendment became effective. Under art. 573 as amended the prosecution had to show that the victim was under 17 years at the time of the offense and did not become 17 years old more than 4 years before institution of prosecution..

Acts 245 for confirmation of title to certain swamp lands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following enactment of 1985 La. Acts 245 (Act 245) to restore titles for certain expropriated swamp lands, the heir filed a petition on behalf of a putative class of successors in interest for a declaratory judgment establishing the class members' title, and judgment was rendered. She then filed suit for mandamus to compel the secretary to implement the provisions of Act 245. On appeal of the judgment sustaining the secretary's exception of prematurity, the heir argued that the trial court erred in granting a collateral attack on the prior judgment and in applying La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1880 to proceedings under Act 245. In affirming, the court ruled that had the legislature wished to exempt declaratory judgment proceedings under Act 245 from the requirements for declaratory judgments under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 1880, it could have done so by clearly stating such intention. The court held that art. 1880 required all affected persons to be made parties to a declaratory suit, that no adverse parties were named, served, confronted with any evidence, or given an opportunity to appear in the heir's proceeding, and that the judgment was, therefore, a nullity.</SPAN></P>

The decedent's family sued the cardiovascular surgeon, claiming that he was guilty of malpractice. The trial court found in favor of the surgeon, and the family appealed the ruling. The court held that the verdict was improperly obtained, because the jury instructions were in error. The court stated that the jury instruction improperly instructed that a local standard of care applied, rather than a national standard of care, and therefore the court was required to make an independent determination. The court determined that the surgeon committed malpractice, because he failed to treat the decedent's surgical wound infections, and the surgeon's negligence was a substantial factor in the decedent's death. In addition, the court rendered judgment in the family's favor, concluded that they were entitled to medical damages up to the statutory maximum under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a property dispute between the parties, the trial court denied an exception of prescription filed on behalf of the parish, held that the land in question was subject to the school trust reserved by the United States, held that the school board was not a proper party to bring the lawsuit and maintained the exception of no right of action, and found the defenses of laches and estoppel to be moot. Both parties appealed. The suit was titled &quot;State of Louisiana ex rel Plaquemines Parish School Board,&quot; and thus suit was brought in the name of the State. The court found that the school board was authorized both by statute and by written authorization by the Attorney General to bring the suit. Accordingly, the court found that the trial court erred in granting the exception of no right of action and reversed that part of the judgment. In all other respects the judgment was affirmed and the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Following a hearing, the trial court denied their motions and granted the State's motion to dispose of the property. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the police obtained a search warrant and arrested defendants prior to the search and seizure. Defendants pled guilty to gambling without having moved to suppress the evidence seized and, consequently, without reserving any rights to contest the seizure. As a result they were not in a position to attack the seizure on the ground that the warrant was defective or that the search exceeded the limits of the warrant. Specifically, they were not in a position to attack the seizure of cash found in a safe at the address named in the warrant where the search was authorized.</SPAN></P>

Applying the &quot;same evidence&quot; test, the court held that defendant's convictions of both offenses violated La. Const. of 1974, art. I, &sect; 15 because the same evidence used to convict defendant of manslaughter was also used to convict him of second degree feticide. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for mistrial during opening statement when the prosecutor made a reference to a statement defendant gave to police; although the prosecutor violated La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 767, defendant did not show prejudice because he knew, prior to trial, that the State intended to use the statement and the prosecutor gave no details about the statement. Defense counsel's assistance was not constitutionally deficient; counsel's decisions not to give opening or closing arguments or to seek supervisory review of the denial of his motions were part of his trial strategy.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed both the conviction and sentence, holding that the record showed that defendant was informed at her arraignment of her right to trial by jury. The court noted that her testimony later at trial evidenced that she was aware and alert, and able to make appropriate responses to counsel's questions. Finally, defendant had prior experience as an accused in a criminal prosecution. Under those circumstances, the court found that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived her right to a jury trial. The court concluded that because defendant failed to file the requisite motion, she was precluded from raising her argument of an illegal sentence on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which sentenced him to 18 years hard labor upon his conviction of simple burglary, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62.2. He claimed that the sentence was vindictive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state offered defendant six and one-half years if he pleaded guilty to simple burglary, but threatened to multiple bill him if he did not plead guilty. Defendant rejected the offer. After his conviction, the trial court sentenced defendant to 10 years; the state then proved defendant had a prior felony conviction and the trial court sentenced him to 8 more years under the Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1A(1). In vacating the sentence and remanding the matter, the court first held that there was nothing vindictive about defendant's sentence. The court held that the sentence was a result of the give-and-take of plea negations and was not a violation of due process. But the court found many errors patent, starting with the fact that the trial court had failed to vacate defendant's original sentence, rendering the habitual offender sentence a nullity. The court also noted that the trial court did not bother to find the number of prior felonies defendant had committed. The trial court also failed to give credit for time served and advise defendant of the prescriptive period for filing post-conviction motions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's sentence and remanded the matter for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction, because after reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed an armed robbery by taking money from the hotel and committed kidnapping by forcibly taking the manager from the hotel. The court also determined that the defendant failed to establish a legal defense of insanity or involuntary intoxication because there was no evidence that defendant had ingested LSD or that he hallucinated, or that he was suffering from a mental disease or defect.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant entered a guilty plea on five counts of forgery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:72 and was sentenced to four years at hard labor on each count with the sentences to run consecutively. After the defendant's motion for reconsideration of sentence was denied, the defendant appealed, arguing that the sentence was impermissibly excessive. In affirming, the court concluded that the imposition of consecutive sentences totaling twenty years was not so excessive as to require a reversal. The maximum penalty that could be imposed under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:72 for each count was a fine of not more than $ 5,000 or imprisonment for not more than ten years or both. The defendant was sentenced to less than one-half the maximum on each count. The Louisiana Felony Sentencing Guidelines recommended a sentence from 60 to 72 months for concurrent sentences and from 180 to 192 months for consecutive sentences. The defendant was sentenced to 48 months, or four years, above the guideline recommendation. The sentence was not so grossly disproportionate to the severity of the crimes and the defendant's criminal history so as to shock the court's sense of justice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Assessor for the Third District of New Orleans disputed a judgment of the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Division M (Louisiana), which issued a writ of mandamus requiring him to grant appellees, sellers and purchasers, a homestead exemption on a bond for deed contract. In his answer to appellees' petition for mandamus the Assessor sought a declaratory judgment that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:2948 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that the purpose of &sect; 9:2948 was to place bond for deed purchasers, with respect to the homestead exemption, in a position equal to that of purchasers who could pay cash or qualify for mortgages to finance home acquisitions. On appeal, the court noted that neither the parties nor the trial court considered the possible application of La. Const. of 1974, art. 7, &sect; 15 to the issue. Inter alia, art. 7, &sect; 15 denied the legislature the power to extinguish any obligation of an individual to the state. An individual's obligation to pay ad valorem taxes arose directly from art. 7, &sect; 15, as contemplated by La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1751. Therefore, art. 7, &sect; 15 created an obligation to pay ad valorem taxes to the state. That obligation rested upon the purchasers, because they had assumed the obligation in the bond for deed contract. The court held that, because &sect; 9:2948 extinguished an obligation owed by individuals, &sect; 9:2948 was unconstitutional. Even if the purchasers could be characterized as residential lessees under La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 18, the result was the same, because it was the extinguishment of the obligation of the sellers that was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment granting the writ of mandamus and rendered declaratory judgment finding the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal defendant alleged that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress evidence seized from an invalid consensual search.

Defendant testified that his counsel explained to him his rights to trial by jury, to confront his accusers, and against self-incrimination and that he understood that by pleading guilty, he would give up those rights.

Ann. &sect; 22:1220(A)(2) following an automobile accident, plaintiff driver appealed from the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, in and for the Parish of Iberville, Louisiana, which maintained an exception of no cause of action raised by defendant, an excess liability insurer, after the insurer failed to pay a settlement within 30 days after an agreement had been reduced to writing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a sheriff's deputy collided with his automobile, the driver filed suit against several defendants, including the sheriff, his primary and excess liability insurers, the sheriff's risk management fund, and the fund's excess insurers. The driver settled with all defendants but the excess insurers, with whom he had agreed upon a settlement. The trial court ruled that &sect; 22:1220 was a substantive law and its application would be retroactive. The effective date of &sect; 22:1220 was subsequent to the date of the accident and issuance of the contract. However, the it was effective before the settlement was reduced to writing and the insurers' subsequent delay in payment. Prior to the enactment of &sect; 22:1220, an insurer had no duty to a third party claimant. The court held that, although &sect; 22:1220 created new rights, duties, and liabilities regarding the insurer, insured, and non-insured claimant, its application to actions which occurred after its effective date was prospective, not retroactive, regardless of whether the policy and ensuing accident pre-existed the effective date. The delay in payment occurred after the effective date of &sect; 22:1220; therefore &sect; 22:1220 was applicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court maintaining the insurer's peremptory exception and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff contended that the statute deprived her of due process of law and access to the courts, and unfairly discriminated against her on the basis of physical condition. The court found that the statute was unconstitutional both as to latency periods greater than and less than three years, for to hold otherwise was an unreasonable discrimination on the basis of physical condition under La.

The court affirmed the portion of the judgment finding that &sect; 9:5628 was unconstitutional as applied to causes of action and damages caused by diseases with a latency period of over three years, but reversed the portion of the judgment finding &sect; 9:5628 constitutional as applied to plaintiff's claims.</SPAN></P>

He pleaded nolo contendere to a reduced charge of manslaughter and the trial court sentenced him to 40 years at hard labor. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. Defendant insisted that he should have been charged with manslaughter initially. The court held that defendant got a break when his charge was reduced. Defendant claimed that there was no specific intent present as required for the offense of second degree murder. Yet he failed to show that his intoxication obviated specific intent. The court found that the fashion of the victim's death exhibited a continuous assault indicative of specific intent. Defendant asserted that his criminal history reflected no convictions for violent offenses, yet his history included an arrest for aggravated assault. He claimed that the trial court's statement that the &quot;victim was beaten so badly that he was unrecognizable by the people who arrived at the scene&quot; was a blatant exaggeration. The official statement of the first officer to arrive at the scene and the autopsy record showed that the statement was not an exaggeration.</SPAN></P>

Because the inmate's supplemental petition that challenged the constitutionality of the statute was neither filed nor served until after the judgment was signed, the court held that the issue was never before the trial court and was waived. The court noted the inmate's assertion that the State was liable for the district attorney's acts because the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office was a quasi agency of the State. The court noted that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 42:1441.1, 42:1441.2(A), 42:1441.3(A) protected the State from liability due to the acts of the district attorney, and retroactive application of the statutes was permissible because they merely stated the what the law intended, and did not make new law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant appealed the sentence imposed by the 40th Judicial District Court for the Parish of St. John the Baptist (Louisiana) after he entered a guilty plea to the charge of aggravated battery, arguing that the district court impermissibly deviated from the Louisiana Sentencing Guidelines and further failed to consider mitigating factors that would have served to lessen his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant pled guilty to aggravated battery and was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension and was ordered to pay restitution. The defendant appealed his sentence. The court rejected the argument that the district court erred in deviating from the sentencing guidelines and imposing the statutory maximum sentence. Where the offender's conduct was deliberately cruel and where the victim suffered severe and permanent injuries, the district court did not err in deviating from the sentencing guidelines, and the imposition of the statutory maximum was not excessive. In vacating the sentence and remanding for resentencing, however, the court concluded that patent error existed. The aggravated battery statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34, did not provide for a sentence without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence, and restitution was permitted only in cases where the sentence was suspended and the defendant was placed on probation. Further, the district court erred in failing to give the defendant credit for time served prior to the imposition of sentence as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 880.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sentence was vacated, and the matter was remanded for resentencing where the district court committed patent error in imposing sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the evidence established centralized accounting under direct control of a single individual, transactions conducted on other than arms'-length basis, and transfers of funds without property security. The court further held that there was not a meeting of the minds, resulting in an enforceable contract between the commissioner and the shareholder, or prohibiting the commissioner from seeking control of the companies, in connection with the liquidation as the court found that the shareholder failed to prove the threshold element required to invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a creditor, and defendant, a debtor, appealed a judgment from the Nineteenth Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), which dismissed the creditor's petition for writ of attachment of the debtor's immovable property with prejudice. The debtor's reconventional demand was also dismissed with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The creditor filed a petition for writ of attachment, seeking attachment of the debtor's property and judgment for an outstanding balance due for the sale of a ring. The debtor filed a declinatory exception and sought dissolution of the writ of attachment. The trial court dismissed the creditor's petition with prejudice, holding that the debtor's fiance was the true purchaser of the ring. The debtor's reconventional demand was dismissed with prejudice because she failed to prove that any damages were sustained as a result of the alleged improper physical seizure. The court affirmed the judgment. The debtor's fiance made the payments on the ring. The debtor was not aware that the ring had been paid for until the lawsuit. Therefore the trial court did not err in finding that she was not the purchaser of the ring. Because the creditor failed to prevail on his claim, the writ of attachment was properly dissolved. The court ruled that the debtor was a nonresident at the time that the writ of attachment was filed because her bank account, driver's license, and vehicle registration was from North Carolina; therefore, the writ was properly based upon the nonresidency of the debtor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of the creditor's petition for writ of attachment of the debtor's immovable property to collect a balance due on the sale of a ring. The dismissal of the debtor's reconventional demand was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The husband had been ordered to live outside the state pursuant to a protective order proceeding initiated by the wife, who alleged that the husband had attacked her with a butcher knife. The trial court ordered the husband to pay the wife support payments of $ 1,000 each month. On appeal, the court first found that the trial court could properly assess the wife's claim for spousal support under either La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:291 or La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46:2131. The court also found that that the trial court was not restricted to a time limitation of three months in making its award of spousal support. The court found no error in the trial court's assessment of the husband's support obligation by making an award proportioned to the needs of the wife, the claimant spouse, and the means of the husband, the other spouse. Furthermore, the court could not say that the trial court's $ 1,000 award of support to the wife was not supported by the record. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the trial court was within its discretion in deviating from the sentencing guidelines where it found the aggravating circumstance that defendant attempted to intimidate a witness in the proceeding. The court further held that, considering the factors considered by the sentencing court, defendant's sentence did not constitute an unnecessary infliction of pain and suffering, nor did the sentence shock any sense of justice, and thus was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

The form was withdrawn by the company after defendant Deputy Commissioner informed the company that plaintiff failed to disclose an investigation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, pro se, appealed his convictions and sentences in the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish, Section J (Louisiana). He claimed that the sentences were excessive, his right to appeal was violated by an incomplete record, he stood trial in prison attire, his counsel was ineffective for failure to object and investigate, the State used its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner, and it withheld exculpatory evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of theft and aggravated battery. The trial court modified the theft verdict and sentenced him to consecutive sentences of six months for the theft and 10 years at hard labor for the aggravated battery. The sentences were consecutive to a previously imposed six month sentence for contempt of court. An oral motion to reconsider the sentence was denied, and defendant appealed. The court held that where defendant created an outburst and used obscene, offensive language in the court, the sentence was not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the offense. As to the 10 year sentence, the court found that where the trial court clearly articulated considerations and the factual basis for the sentence, and defendant's actions were egregious and sufficient to support a charge of attempted murder, the sentence was not excessive. Yet the trial court did not express reasons for imposing consecutive sentences. Where the record on appeal was incomplete, defendant was not entitled to a new trial because he did not state that his substantive rights had been affected. Any other claims were not objected to in a timely fashion and were not preserved for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences as to excessiveness, but the matter was remanded for the trial court to articulate reasons for imposing consecutive sentences. Defendant's right to seek review of those reasons was reserved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former inmate was seriously injured while he was incarcerated at a private prison facility.

The ARP addressed itself to actions brought by offenders. &quot;Offender&quot; was defined in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1174(2) as someone who was in the physical custody of the state or a sheriff. The court pointed out the absurd consequence of interpreting the term &quot;offenders&quot; to include former inmates. Under such an interpretation, an inmate injured on the day prior to being released would have to have his rights governed by the ARP and would have to file his complaint in the prison system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment dismissing the former inmate's personal injury suit against the contractor operating a private prison facility and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the evidence against defendant, taken in its entirety, was sufficient to prove the elements of six counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that, although inconsistency in a victim's testimony compared to her initial report left a reasonable doubt as to whether defendant masturbated in a victim's presence, there was sufficient testimony of other acts to sustain the additional count of indecent behavior with juveniles, such as taking photographs of that victim in various stages of undress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An application for a writ from the 11th Judicial District Court, Parish of Sabine, State of Louisiana, was filed by six defendants convicted of violation of a city ordinance that prohibited the sale of alcoholic beverages on Sunday. Defendants' motions to quash the bills of information were denied. Defendants claimed that the ordinance was unconstitutional for failure to submit it to the local voters as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:191.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Sunday closing ordinance was passed by the local governing body but was not approved by the subdivision voters in an election. The issue was whether or not the ordinance was valid if the voters had not voted on the issue as required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:191. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:493 a local subdivision could enact an ordinance regulating, but not prohibiting, the sale of alcoholic beverages where its enactment was a reasonable exercise of police power necessary for public health, morals, safety, and peace. To the extent that &sect; 26:493 could be read to authorize Sunday closing ordinances without an election, it conflicted with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:191. Upon review, the court pointed out that the jurisprudence provided that the statute more specifically directed to the matter at issue governed. In the situation at hand, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. &sect; 26:493 dealt with regulation of alcohol generally while La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:191 dealt specifically with the narrow issue of Sunday sales. Accordingly, the provisions of &sect; 51:191 governed. Defendants' bills of information were quashed because the ordinance could only be enacted through the election process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff leasing company appealed a judgment of the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which denied a challenge to a tax assessment on leased cars under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:302(B). The company argued that the assessment was erroneous, it was exempt from sales taxes under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:305.36, it was entitled to a refund of certain taxes, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1486 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company financed car sales through leases. Its standard forms identified the transactions as leases and referred to the parties as &quot;lessor&quot; and &quot;lessee.&quot; On appeal, the court noted that such terms were not consistent with a financing agreement of a sale. Using the criteria in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:301(12) and jurisprudence, the court held that there was no manifest error in the trial court's affirmance of the judgment of the Louisiana Board of Tax Appeals (Board), which found that the transactions were leases with options to purchase and not conditional sales and that the lease tax in &sect; 47:302(B) was due. The taxes in &sect; 47:302(B) and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:302(A) were not duplicative, so the company was not exempt under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:305.36 from paying initial sales taxes on the cars involved in the transactions and it was not entitled to a refund of taxes paid. The exemption applied only to cars the company bought after it obtained an exemption certificate under &sect; 47:305.36. The court did not address the constitutionality of &sect; 47:1486 because the company's suit had proceeded under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1431 et seq. and &sect; 47:1486 never figured in the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and remanded to the Louisiana Board of Tax Appeals for recomputation of the assessment, interest and penalties, and collection of the taxes.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rendered a judgment that the biological father had forfeited his parental rights. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new hearing. Initially, the court held that no other state had jurisdiction to make a child custody determination under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1702(A). The voluntary act of surrender was executed in the state and the child was born in the state. The biological father preserved his right to be heard and met his burden of proving his affirmative efforts to establish a parental relationship with the minor child pursuant to La. Child. Code art. 1137. The court held that under La. Child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction and sentence, by the Criminal District Court, Orleans Parish (Louisiana), for second degree battery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from his conviction for second degree battery, defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction and that his sentence was constitutionally excessive. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that a rational trier of fact could conclude that the victim was a credible witness and that defendant made an unprovoked physical assault on the victim with the intent to inflict serious bodily injury. The court also affirmed the sentence. It held that a review of the sentencing transcript showed that the trial judge adequately articulated sufficient reason for imposing the three-year sentence, which in fact was lenient as compared to the Louisiana Sentencing Guidelines recommended range. The court further held that the sentence was not constitutionally excessive, in light of defendant's three prior felony convictions and the violent nature of the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
