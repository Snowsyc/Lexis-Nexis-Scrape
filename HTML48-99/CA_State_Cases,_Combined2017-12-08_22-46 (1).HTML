<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, personal representative and family of deceased, appealed an order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which sustained a demurrer by defendants, state and state parole officer, on grounds of immunity and dismissed plaintiff's action against defendants which alleged defendants' failure to prevent the murder of deceased by a parolee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prisoner with a history of pedophilia, violence, and drug abuse was paroled on conditions that he not leave the state and that he not be alone with children. The parolee violated both of these terms, however defendants, state and state parole officer, did not take steps to arrest parolee upon his return. Parolee then left the state again, and kidnapped, tortured, raped and killed decedent in Arizona. Plaintiffs, personal representative and family of decedent, filed an action against defendants for failure to prevent the murder and a civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court sustained the demurrers of defendants, and dismissed the action based on grounds of immunity. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that defendants were immune from liability under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 845.8, and that there was no mandatory duty imposed on defendant to arrest parolee which would provide the basis for civil liability. The court rejected plaintiff's arguments that Arizona law should have applied because the actions of defendants occurred in California; and that plaintiffs were deprived of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant students sought review of a grant of summary judgment in favor of respondent school board officials in appellants' action to prohibit respondents from censoring their video made for a high school film arts class. Appellants asserted that respondents were prohibited from censoring the student-authored work under Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 48907 and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, which protected students' rights to free expression.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a grant of summary judgment in favor of respondent school board officials in an action brought by appellant students for a declaratory judgment that respondents were prohibited from censoring or restricting the release of a video made in connection with a film arts class. The video depicted the story of teenage parents and contained profanity and explicit reference to sexual activity. The court rejected appellants' argument that respondents were precluded by Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 48907 and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, which provided protections for students' free expression rights, from requiring appellants to delete the profanity. The court held that the video was an official student publication and that respondents could restrain such expression because it violated the professional standards of English and journalism provisions of &sect; 48907. The court found that the statute, which permitted prior restraints of profane student expression in official student publications, was a valid time, place or manner restriction when respondents asserted a compelling state interest in promoting moral improvement and regulations were narrowly tailored to meet that interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the People, sought review of the order of the Municipal Court for the Santa Clara Judicial District of Santa Clara County (California) which convicted defendant for violating Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 35551, which prohibited the operation of a vehicle over certain statutory weight limits without a permit. The lower court imposed a fine of $ 482. Plaintiff, the People, appealed, claiming that the applicable fine should have been in excess of $ 22,000. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss and a motion for sanctions. The court affirmed and granted defendant's motion to dismiss, holding that plaintiff could not challenge the allegedly unauthorized sentence imposed by the lower court in a misdemeanor case, either by appeal or by extraordinary writ. The judgment was not appealable unless the appeal was authorized by statute, and it did not become appealable merely because it was erroneous. The mere existence of any order after judgment did not make the underlying judgment necessarily appealable. The court determined that plaintiff could not circumvent the limitation on appeals by seeking review by extraordinary writ. The situation of the lower court allegedly miscalculating the fine was not likely to reoccur nor was it of such importance to be considered an extraordinary writ. Sanctions for a frivolous appeal were not warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order, holding that plaintiff, the People, did not have statutory authority to challenge, either by appeal or extraordinary writ, an unauthorized sentence for misdemeanor, imposed by the lower court upon defendant. Defendant's motion to dismiss was granted, and motion for sanctions was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant superior court challenged an order from the Superior Court of Mendocino County (California) that denied its petition for writ of mandate to direct respondent county board of supervisors to provide funding for the salaries of court employees on designated furlough days and to modify the furlough programs to exclude court employees based on Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 68108, respondent county board of supervisors informed appellant superior court that the courts were to be closed on certain days to effect unpaid work furlough days authorized by respondent's agreement with county employees, but appellant issued orders commanding respondent to provide funding for the salaries of court employees on designated furlough days and to modify the furlough programs to exclude court employees. When respondent failed to honor its orders, appellant petitioned for a writ of mandate, which was denied. On appeal, the court vacated that order and ordered the trial court to issue the writ of mandate, holding that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 68108 was unconstitutional. The court found that the words of the statute clearly and unequivocally granted respondent the right to close the courts on furlough days except when the presiding judge declared a judicial emergency. This power was unconstitutional because it authorized legislative exercise of powers reserved to the judiciary in matters that impaired the efficient exercise of the judicial function.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the rule of convenience applied to a violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 12500, so the burden shifted to appellant to prove that he had a valid license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant alleged gang members challenged the injunction to abate gang activity in a neighborhood and argued that it was unauthorized under the California Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act (STEP Act), Cal.

The court modified the injunction, affirmed it as modified, and held that the STEP Act was inapplicable because respondent city's complaint was based only on public nuisance law. The court held that the public nuisance law applied to criminal activity that interfered with the residents' use and enjoyment of their homes and streets. The court held that the injunction's prohibition against using words or symbols that referred to the gang and wearing clothing that bore the gang name was an infringement on protected U.S. Const. amend. I rights. The court struck down sections of the injunction for vagueness and overbreadth and held that mere membership in a gang was not a crime and noncriminal associational conduct by the gang members could not be enjoined on that basis alone.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was modified and affirmed as modified because, insofar as the injunction reached no further than the United States Constitution allowed, it was properly used to abate gang-related criminal activity as a public nuisance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant renter challenged the judgment that found unconstitutional&nbsp;Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1785.13(a)(3), a statute that prohibited disclosure of an unlawful detainer regarding a prospective tenant by a credit reporting agency, and only that form of disclosure. The court affirmed the judgment and held that a state could not completely suppress the dissemination of truthful information about lawful activity. The court held that the information that appellee credit reporting agencies sold was not commercial speech under U.S. Const. amend. I because it did not propose a commercial transaction, and the selling of the information did not raise it to the level of commercial speech. The information was lawfully retained and was truthful. The information was in the custody of the state because it was available through the court's public records. Although the state had an interest in the availability of rental housing for those needing it, that interest did not justify a ban on publication by credit reporting agencies of lawfully obtained and truthful information contained in court records open to the perusal of anyone.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner County Board of Supervisors sought a writ of review directing respondent judge and inmates as real parties in interest, to vacate the order from the Superior Court of San Diego County (California) that adjudged board members and county sheriff in contempt and imposed fines for willful disobedience of a consent decree arising out of a jail overcrowding lawsuit. The sheriff had not joined the board as petitioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found petitioner county board of supervisors and the county sheriff in contempt of a consent decree for willfully disobeying the court-ordered inmate population cap imposed after a jail overcrowding lawsuit. Petitioner board, without the sheriff, sought a writ of review against respondent judge and inmates as real parties at interest, to vacate the contempt order and assessed fines. The court found that petitioner's only clear duties regarding the county jail were to provide the sheriff with food, clothing, and bedding for prisoners under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4015 and to pay other expenses incurred in keeping prisoners under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 29062 - not to oversee daily operations. The court concluded the contempt ruling did not require petitioner to take specific funding action or to reopen a closed facility. The court held there was insubstantial evidence to find petitioner had the ability to comply with the consent decree beyond its mandated statutory duties. The court granted a writ of review and vacated the contempt order for petitioner only and directed issuance of an order for repayment of fines to petitioner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff creditor filed suit against defendant personal representative of the estate, to recover losses incurred as a result of defendant's rejection of plaintiff's claim. The claim was based upon a judgment from an auto accident whereby the deceased was to make monthly payments to plaintiff. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer because plaintiff failed to follow the procedures of the California Probate Code. On appeal, plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of the Probate Code to the extent that it pertained to the administration of creditor claims against the estate of a decedent. The court rejected this argument and found the Probate Code to be constitutional because it was amended to give creditors more latitude in filing late claims and because it provided for actual notice to be sent to all known creditors. The court affirmed the judgment and held that plaintiff failed to allege facts sufficient to show that it complied with the late-claim remedy statute,&nbsp;Cal. Probate Code &sect; 9103, and was still denied due process. The court also found that defendant could not have known of plaintiff until it filed the claim against the estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cotton breeders appealed an order of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which denied all but one of their claims seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and a writ of mandate, after defendants denied their applications to plant nonapproved colored cotton. Defendants cross-appealed the trial court's holding that Cal. Food &amp; Agric. Code &sect; 52856 was unenforceable by virtue of being unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cotton breeders' applications to plant colored cotton for breeding and testing purposes were denied. They sought declaratory and other relief, asserting violations of due process, equal protection, and statutory intent, and contended that the statutory scheme exceeded the legislature's police power and amounted to an uncompensated taking. The trial court held Cal. Food &amp; Agric. Code &sect; 52856&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague and unenforceable, otherwise denying relief. The court held that, as erroneously interpreted by defendant state officials, the statute was improperly applied. Plaintiffs need not make their varieties available to other producers in order to engage in research and development or to seek approval for their varieties. However, the court disagreed that &sect; 52856 was unconstitutionally vague. Defendants' regulations requiring plaintiffs to obtain permission for research and development of nonapproved varieties were held void as usurping legislative authority. While plaintiffs were entitled to judicial relief to that extent, the court otherwise rejected their challenge to the statutory and regulatory scheme governing the San Joaquin Valley Quality Cotton District.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded, with directions to issue a new judgment. The court agreed with the trial court's conclusion that defendant state officials incorrectly denied plaintiff cotton breeders' applications, but based on an incorrect statutory interpretation, not because the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court also held that defendants' program regulations usurped authority not conferred by the legislature, and were thus void.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, whose conviction was based on a breath test, contended that he was denied due process where he was not allowed to adduce evidence as to the variability between blood and breath-alcohol measurements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by an officer for speeding. The officer smelled alcohol coming from defendant's vehicle. Defendant was permitted to choose between a blood test and a breath test. He elected a breath test whose results showed an alcohol concentration of between 0.10 and 0.11 percent. Defendant was convicted under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152(b) (1990) of driving with .08 percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his blood. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the legislature's prohibition against driving with a certain amount of breath alcohol concentration was within its power to regulate driving. The court held that proscribing defendant from adducing evidence as to the variability of blood and breath alcohol measurements did not violate his right to due process. Section 23152(b) did not require breath alcohol to be converted to blood alcohol concentration, but rather provided that the breath alcohol ratio would apply when the breath test was used regardless of its blood alcohol conversion value. The statute did not presume intoxication but defined the substantive offense as driving with a specified concentration of alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, land developers, challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Marin County (California), which denied appellants' petitions to have a portion of land declared as not marshland subject to the authority of respondent San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission and to declare respondent's actions as an unlawful regulatory taking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission filed an action to have appellant land developers vacate land respondent wanted declared marshland and subject to their jurisdiction. The trial court granted a stay pending the decision in another case, which would resolve the jurisdictional dispute. Respondent appealed the stay, but during the pendency of the appeal, the collateral case was adjudicated with a finding that only a portion of the property was marshland. Respondent dismissed its appeal, but the court nonetheless addressed appellants' issues regarding the denial of a declaratory judgment. The court held that the claim that a portion of appellants' property was marshland was barred by collateral estoppel and res judicata, and that, even if it were not so barred, the claim still would have no basis. The court held that respondent's actions did not constitute an unconstitutional taking because no portion of the property had been taken and there was no taking merely because of the time spent to adjudicate the jurisdictional issues. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found appellant not guilty of residential burglary by reason of insanity and appellant was committed to the department of mental health.

Appellant sought review of the trial court's decision. The court affirmed the trial court and denied appellant's petition. The court held that &sect; 1026.5 was constitutional because due process did not require that the standard for legal insanity under the M'Naghten test and the standard for extension of commitment for an insanity acquittee be identical. The extended commitment had a reasonable relation to the purpose of commitment. A jury instruction on the meaning of mental disease, defect, or disorder was not required because its meaning was explained in the testimony. Appellant was not denied equal protection because there was a rational basis for the different treatment of insanity acquittees and civilly committed individuals. An insanity acquittee placed mental health at issue and demonstrated dangerousness by committing a criminal offense.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner sought a writ of mandate to declare respondents' adoption of the rule to be an abuse of discretion. The court let the writ issue and held that respondent did not have the authority under &sect; 69898 to accomplish the transfer by rule of court. The voters chose petitioner to carry out clerk duties. The voters thus had a constitutional right to have those duties carried out by petitioner. Because the California legislature is subject to the California constitution, it would not have had the power to transfer clerk duties from petitioner to the superior court executive officer during petitioner's term. Since the legislature could not delegate a power it did not itself have, it could not give such a power to respondent through the enactment of a statute. The inherent power of courts to conduct their business is subject to constitutional limitations.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals originally affirmed the trial court's judgment, then, following instructions from the United States Supreme Court in a related case, invited the parties to submit briefs so it could reconsider. The court affirmed the injunction again, holding that the injunction's restrictions on appellants' free speech were content-neutral, and were reasonable because appellants' actions threatened a significant level of harm to respondent's patients, even though appellants had not offered violence. The court held that appellants' actions unreasonably interfered with respondent's patients' constitutional right to privacy, which was afforded a greater level of protection under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, than under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court reversed the award of attorney's fees against two appellants, because a default judgment had been issued against them and the attorney's fees award violated Cal. Civ. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of the decision from the Superior Court of San Joaquin County (California) that, in a civil asset forfeiture proceeding for forfeiture of property connected with drug trafficking, entered summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings in favor of respondent claimants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police stopped respondent claimants' car. Since neither respondent had a driver's license, police had the car towed. An inventory of the car disclosed four ounces of marijuana, $ 31,500 cash, and a cellular phone. One respondent was issued a citation for possession of marijuana and released. Respondents were served with notice of nonjudicial forfeiture proceedings for the cash and cellular phone. Appellant, the state, challenged the summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings entered in favor of respondents. Appellant argued the trial court erred in determining a criminal conviction for drug trafficking was a prerequisite to forfeiture. The court found that the statutes, 1988 Cal. Stat. 1492, were in effect at the time of the seizure of property and at the time the action was filed in the trial court. The effect of the 1994 law, 1994 Cal. Stat. 314, was to continue in force the same law that applied when the case arose. At all times since seizure of the contested property there was an asset forfeiture law in California, which did not require a criminal conviction as a prerequisite to forfeiture of the property at issue in this case. The judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that, in a civil asset forfeiture proceeding for forfeiture of property connected with drug trafficking, entered summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings in favor of respondents because California's asset forfeiture law did not require a criminal conviction as a prerequisite to forfeiture of the property.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the drug-related conditions of probation were not unconstitutional, as they were reasonably related to appellant's rehabilitation, given his history of drug use, and they were not overdrawn, and that there was no prejudicial error in the trial court's refusal to let appellant speak at sentencing, as the superior court complied with Cal.

The court found that there was no previously established constitutional right to counsel in proceedings affecting parental rights. The automatic right to counsel afforded in California proceedings affecting parental rights was only statutory. There was no right to a Wende review in dependency proceedings. The delay necessary to perform a Wende review was tolerable only if there was a substantial likelihood that Wende reviews would avoid a serious risk of parental rights being erroneously restricted or terminated. Such a risk did not exist in dependency cases. The court concluded that on appeal from orders under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 300, 366.26 adjudicating dependency and terminating parental rights, where counsel for an appellant filed a brief raising no issues, the reviewing court was not required to conduct its own independent review of the record.

Defendant was convicted for making terrorist threats and sought review of the judgment. Appellate decisions were in conflict as to whether the conditional language used in the threat by appellant supported a conviction under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422. The court concluded that conditionality was only one circumstance to be considered in the overall analysis of whether the threat was a true threat, and it was not a bright line separating actionable threats from protected ones. Appellant's substantial evidence challenge was not met with favor by the reviewing court. The court affirmed appellant's conviction. The court found that appellant's threat contained a considerable degree of unconditionality since compliance with defendant's condition would be practically impossible. Further, the other three factors in &sect; 422 were also met because appellant's threats and conduct aimed at her former attorney was, in significant degrees unequivocal, immediate, and specific.</SPAN></P>

The expert received bricks of cocaine seized from defendant's homes and tested several bricks which he weighed and analyzed and each tested positive for cocaine. Defendant objected to this evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff Orange County Social Service Agency appealed the order of the Superior Court of Orange County (California) refusing, after considering Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26 and the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1901 et seq., foster parents permission to adopt two Indian children abandoned by their parents, but ordering a guardianship with required visitation to defendant father's Oklahoma tribe as the best permanent plan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After parents abandoned two Indian children, and reunification plans failed, the trial court decided, under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26, that rather than let the foster parents adopt them, they would be under a guardianship with a required annual four-week stay with the defendant father's Oklahoma tribe. Plaintiff Orange County Social Service Agency appealed. Reversing the decision, the court ruled that when children could not have been returned to their parents, and were likely to be adopted, any selection other than adoption must have been sufficiently weighty to offset a child's need for a stable, permanent home. The court found the increased cultural benefits from forming a bond with the father's tribe did not outweigh legislatively preferred adoption, adding that the trial court found that any removal from the foster parents would cause irreparable emotional damage. The court held that the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C.S &sect; 1901 et seq., was not violated because the affected tribes were given the opportunity to intervene early in the proceeding, and the case was not one of children living on a reservation being snatched from a tribe by overzealous social workers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Protesters were charged with anti-abortion picketing within the proscribed distance of the homes of staff members of an abortion clinic, a misdemeanor violation of the City of San Jose Municipal Code. On petition for extraordinary review, the superior court issued a writ of mandate directing the municipal court to sustain protesters' demurrers that were granted in municipal court. Although the superior court determined that the ordinance was content neutral and not vague, and that it left open, ample, and alternative channels of communication, it was under compulsion of a decision of the United States Supreme Court that ruled a 300-foot buffer zone was unconstitutionally broad. The court reversed the superior court's ruling, finding that the ordinance was a less onerous, bright line standard intended to protect an important privacy interest, that of residential privacy, which includes protection of the unwilling listener in his home, and that protesters failed to show that the ordinance was substantially broader than necessary to protect the right of residential privacy involved, and that as a matter of law they had no alternative channels of communication.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's grant of the writ of prohibition, stating that respondent superior court and real parties in interest protesters could not demonstrate that the conclusions justifying the ordinance were so unreasonable and arbitrary as to be beyond the power of the legislature, and commanded respondent to vacate its order and to issue a new order denying the petition for writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant banks sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which approved the modified rehabilitation plan submitted by respondent insurance commissioner in its insurer insolvency conservatorship of a defaulted insurance company. Respondent insurer, as successor in interest to the defaulted insurance company's policies, was also named as an interested party in the proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An insurance company issued guaranteed investment contracts (GIC's), high-yield fixed income securities with no or very low credit ratings. The market for the securities bottomed and the bonds were in default. The company's reserves covering the bonds were depleted. Respondent insurance commissioner placed the insurance company in conservatorship and seized its assets. Respondent insurance commissioner crafted a rehabilitation plan in which respondent insurer issued new policies to the former policyholders of the defaulted company. Policyholders could opt out and receive the liquidation value of their claims. After one appeal, a modified rehabilitation plan was drawn. The lower court approved it. Appellant banks challenged the plan once more, arguing terms of the bond sale were unreasonable and the sales price inadequate. The court found no error in the transfer of the insurance company's business to respondent insurer or in the sale of its bonds. The court affirmed the judgment in all respects, save two reversals on minor points governing the priority of post-1988 municipalities' GIC's, along with its associated attorney's fees, and one appellant bank's interim payments.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court generally affirmed the lower court's judgment approving of the modified rehabilitation plan, but reversed in two respects. It reversed the settlement's approval of the post-1988 municipalities' guaranteed investment contracts, including related attorney's fee provisions. Second, the denial of interest to one appellant bank for interim payments until the appellate decision became final was reversed. The cause was remanded.</SPAN></P>

The police were withdrawn from minority communities pursuant to petitioner senior police commanders' orders and deployed to predominantly Anglo populations. Plaintiffs alleged civil rights violations under Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 51.7, 52. Petitioners sought a writ of mandate that respondent trial court sustain their demurrer to the two civil rights causes of action brought by the plaintiffs. The court issued a writ of mandate, finding that the demurrers should have been sustained, without leave to amend, as to the plaintiffs' two state law claims. The Torts Claims Act provided an immunity from money damages for the failure to provide sufficient police protective services during a riot.

The court affirmed, holding that there were exigent circumstances justifying the search because, at the time of the arrest and seizure, the facts known to the officer and the inferences drawn therefrom were sufficient to lead a reasonable officer to conclude that there was an imminent danger that the contraband he had seen in plain view would be destroyed if he did not act immediately to arrest defendant and seize the evidence. Therefore, the warrantless entry into the hotel room to arrest defendant and seize the contraband was legal, and the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which convicted appellant of grand theft from the person. On the basis of one prior felony conviction, the trial court sentenced appellant to state prison for five years pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(c).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant complained that his sentence under the three strikes law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(c)(5), violated his right to equal protection because it authorized fewer total conduct credits against his sentence for theft than a person convicted of murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190 could earn. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, noting that appellant's contention was based on case authority that the number of credits murderers could earn was dictated by an initiative measure, and thus could not be modified by a later legislative enactment such as Section 667(c)(5). However, the court pointed out that the exact language of Section 667(c)(5), which reduced the total credits that could be earned to one-fifth of one's sentence, was enacted by voter initiative as Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.12(a)(5). By the very reasoning cited by appellant, Section 667(c)(5) effectively changed the total number of credits that could be earned by murderers under the scheme of Section 190 from one-third to one-fifth of the sentence. Therefore, Section 667(c)(5) did not adopt a classification that affected persons convicted of murder differently than persons convicted of other crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction and sentence were affirmed. The statute at issue did not provide for fewer total conduct credits against sentences for thefts and other crimes than another statute provided for murder. Rather, the statute provided a limit to the number of credits that murderers could earn under the other statutory scheme. Therefore, the statute presented no equal protection issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court denied plaintiff drivers' petition for writ of mandate, plaintiff appealed alleging that the Heavy-Duty Vehicle Inspection Program (HDVIP), Cal. Code Regs. tit. 13, &sect; 2180- 2187, adopted by defendant California Air Resources Board (Board) was unlawful. The court affirmed the denial of the writ. Because plaintiffs failed to raise the issue of whether the tests were properly conducted in the administrative proceeding, they waived that argument and therefore were not entitled to relief under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1094.5. In addition, instead of challenging the regulations themselves, plaintiffs contended that the regulations were not being properly administered and that they were therefore entitled to a writ of mandate pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1085. However, in any future proceedings to enforce HDVIP, the cited party could challenge a citation on the basis of lack of correlation of the test equipment. Therefore, plaintiffs had an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the writ.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and held that plaintiff drivers' petition for writ of mandate, which challenged defendant California Air Resources Board's Heavy-Duty Vehicle Inspection Program, should be denied because plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies and they had an adequate remedy at law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which denied their petition for a writ of mandate to vacate its earlier denial of petitioners' motion to dismiss the charges against them for disorderly conduct under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(a), because it found that petitioners had not been denied equal protection of the law by discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court denied petitioners' writ of mandamus, they appealed. The court reversed and held that the writ to vacate a prior order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss should have been granted. The trial court erred in holding that petitioners were required to prove a prosecutor's specific intent to punish a defendant for membership in a group. Although this may be one method of proving discriminatory enforcement, it is not the only method. Petitioners proved that they would not have been arrested except for the invidious discrimination against them and that homophobia accounted for the course of conduct by the police department. Moreover, no rational reason for the deliberate structuring of the decoy operation to focus on homosexuals was shown, leading to the conclusion that no reason for it existed other than hostility toward homosexuals. Such a showing was sufficient to establish an equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed judgment by the Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California), in which a jury verdict was issued in favor of plaintiff developers on their 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims..  Defense motions for new trial on liability and for judgment, notwithstanding the denial of the verdict, were denied, and plaintiffs were awarded attorney's fees. Plaintiffs cross-appealed the granting of defendant's motion for new trial on damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the court determined that the judgment under review was a final judgment, despite the consolidation of causes of action and the severability of certain claims. The court then held that it was error to deny defendant city's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of plaintiff developers on the 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims. The court found that plaintiffs had not shown that they were deprived of a federal constitutional right when plaintiffs were prevented from building the development project in question. The court rejected plaintiffs' assertion that they had a vested right to develop their property, noting that they had not applied for or received a building permit for the project. The court further noted that plaintiffs' substantive due process rights had not been violated where the legislative enactments in question were rationally and substantially related to a legitimate public purpose. The court reversed, declining to reach the issues on cross-appeal where judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been granted because the rational relation of the zoning actions to legitimate governmental interests was fairly debatable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in favor of plaintiff developers on their federal civil rights claims, reversed the denial of defendant city's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and reversed the award of attorney's fees to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs were not entitled to prevail on their civil rights claims where they failed to demonstrate that defendant's zoning actions resulted in a deprivation of plaintiffs' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant used a pipe bomb to blow up his van so that he would be able to go to the hospital to recover from his situation. He was charged under &sect; 12303.3; on a jury request for clarification of the word &quot;wrongfully&quot; for purposes of the statute, the judge stated that &quot;wrongful&quot; meant &quot;without legal justification.&quot; Defendant was convicted. He claimed that the instruction prejudicially misdirected the jury; he argued that the jury should have been instructed that &quot;wrongfully&quot; required the intent to injure or destroy the property of another or an intent to infringe upon the legal rights of another. The court reversed. The court noted that appellate courts could review any jury instruction, even if no objection was made to it at trial, if a substantial right of defendant was affected. The court held that the judge's instruction permitted the jury to convict defendant if the jury found defendant only intended to injure himself or only intended to injure his own personal property. In fact, the statute did not reach such conduct, which was a matter for other provisions of the California Penal Code.</SPAN></P>

Code ch. 32A, was invalid and for monetary damages for an alleged unconstitutional taking of property, denial of equal protection, and denial of a vested rights exemption from the proposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As an initial matter, the appellate court determined that the trial court correctly found that no unconstitutional taking of property occurred through the enactment of Proposition A, City of Oceanside Mun. Code ch. 32A. The appellate court found that the proposition, a growth control regulation, did not, on its face, deny appellant developer all economically viable uses of its property, or fail to advance substantially any legitimate public interest, noting that an invalid regulation was not necessarily an unconstitutional one. The appellate court further found that summary adjudication of appellant's equal protection claim was proper where the existence of the development agreement provided a rational basis to distinguish between appellant and the other developers for purposes of determining whether any vested rights to development had accrued before the proposition went into effect. The appellate court affirmed, upholding the entry of summary judgment on appellant's vested rights/implied contract claim where there was no express representation by respondent city that the property would have been exempt from future regulations governing the timing of development.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the entry of summary judgment in favor of respondent city on all of appellant developer's claims, finding that appellant lacked a viable unconstitutional takings claim where it failed to show that the mere enactment of the invalid growth control ordinance in question denied appellant all economically viable uses of its property or that it did not advance substantially any legitimate public interest.</SPAN></P>

I and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, it wrote that respondent's rules, which were intended to prevent giving a factional minority control of access to its ballot, would not necessarily accomplish this goal. Given this and appellant's interest in preventing voter confusion and minimizing administrative burdens by having uniform election rules, the court concluded that the restrictions placed upon respondent's associational rights were not severe, and therefore did not violate the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) convicted defendant of use of a destructive device and explosive to destroy property, in violation of Cal Penal Code &sect; 12303.3, explosion of a destructive device causing bodily injury in violation of &sect; 12309, and first degree burglary in violation of &sect; 459.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant placed a pipe bomb beneath a motorist's car. The motorist did not know defendant and could not think of a reason why defendant would place a bomb under the automobile. The bomb detonated while defendant placed it under the car, severely injuring defendant. According to defendant, he had not placed the bomb in the vehicle, but was in the process of stealing the vehicle when the explosion occurred. The trial court convicted defendant of three separate offenses. On appeal, defendant argued that he could not be convicted under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12309 when no victim was injured when the car bomb detonated. The court, agreeing with defendant, held that the crime defined by &sect; 12309 required the infliction of injury upon another person. Moreover, the court held that there was no logical explanation to punish defendant with life in prison for causing greater bodily injury to himself.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's decision, which convicted defendant of exploding a destructive device causing bodily injury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff women's association filed a petition for mandamus and injunctive relief to compel defendant state university to follow Cal.

Five years prior, in another county, intervenor alien student proponent successfully sued to enjoin another state university from applying the same code section. An appellate court later upheld the validity of the code section. The court from the other county distinguished its prior order and continued to enforce its injunction despite the appellate court's ruling. In plaintiff's suit, intervenor filed demurrers, motions to strike, and motions to transfer the cause to the other county. The trial court denied the motions and issued a writ of mandate compelling defendant to comply with the code section. The court held that Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3.5 was satisfied because an appellate court had determined that the code section was valid on its face and had interpreted the section. The court held that the prior appellate decision was binding on defendant. Therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of cocaine. Defendant was also charged with prior convictions for the same crime and for other serious offenses, which subjected him to a possible indeterminate sentence of 25 years to life under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667, the three strikes law. Pursuant to a plea bargain with the trial court and over the people's objection, the trial court struck the prior serious offenses and sentenced defendant to a limited jail term. The trial court determined that the three strikes law that prohibited the trial court from striking the offenses violated the doctrine of separation of powers. The trial court found that imposition of an indeterminate sentence for the current drug offense under three strikes constituted cruel or unusual punishment. On appeal, the court vacated the sentence and held that the three strikes limitation on striking allegations of prior convictions did not violate the separation of powers doctrine because the legislation restricted both the ability of both the prosecution and the court to amend the charges. The court further held that imposition of an indeterminate sentence for recidivism did not violate the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Claimant appealed the default judgment entered by the Superior Court, Kern County (California) in the state's action which had sought forfeiture of claimant's pickup truck pursuant to Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11488.5(a)(2) and the order denying claimant relief from the default judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state mailed a personal notice of nonjudicial forfeiture to claimant, the registered owner of a pickup truck that was seized when the driver of the truck was arrested for possession of marijuana. Claimant filed a claim with the lower court to oppose the forfeiture. Some five months later, the state filed a complaint for forfeiture of the truck. In another five months, the state moved for default judgment of the truck on the basis that no answer had been filed in opposition to the complaint. On the date set for proving the default judgment, the lower court did not allow claimant to appear, ruling that it was a default proceeding, and claimant's failure to file an answer precluded his right to appear. The lower court entered a default judgment. Claimant later moved for relief from the default judgment, which was denied by the lower court, and claimant appealed. The court found the lower court's failure to allow claimant to appear and be heard at the date set for proving up the default was an abuse of discretion. No default had been entered against claimant prior to the date of the hearing; thus, his ability to file an answer, appear, or make some other motion was not cut off.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the default judgment entered by the lower court because the lower court's failure to allow claimant to appear and be heard absent an entry of default was an abuse of discretion. The matter was remanded to the lower court with instructions to grant claimant 30 days' leave to file an answer to the complaint for forfeiture.</SPAN></P>

After failing to participate in court-ordered treatment programs, her parental rights were terminated. Upon review, the court affirmed, finding that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26 was not unconstitutional as a finding that an award of custody to the parent would be detrimental to the child before terminating parental rights was the equivalent of a finding of unfitness. The court found that there was no equal protection violation because birth parents whose rights were terminated under &sect; 366.26, were not similarly situated to birth parents whose rights were terminated under Cal. Fam. Code &sect; 7828. The court held that &quot;detriment&quot; in the dependency scheme meant weighing all relevant factors that could cause harm to a child as a result of his return to parental custody and that less severe alternatives meant giving a birth parent the opportunity to rehabilitate herself and reunite with her family via court-ordered services before termination of their rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were accused of perpetrating sexual offenses and attempted offenses on an unconscious victim. At their preliminary hearing, the magistrate denied their request to call the victim as a witness as they had failed to make a sufficient offer of proof pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 866(a). The trial court found that the magistrate abused his discretion and dismissed the case. The state appealed. Upon review, the court reversed, finding that a valid offer of proof should have evidence that was attributed to the testimony of specific witnesses, writings, material objects, or other things presented to the senses, that proved the existence or nonexistence of a fact in issue. The court held that defendants' expectation that the victim might retract her statements was not sufficient under &sect; 866(a). The court found that defendants' right to confrontation was not violated, as it did not attach until the trial portion of the proceedings. The court held that preliminary hearings were limited to establishing probable cause only, and were not to be used for discovery.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant water district challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Riverside County (California), which entered judgment in favor of respondent city after refusing to enjoin enforcement of a local ordinance enacted by respondent. Appellant argued that respondent lacked the statutory authority to require appellant to collect taxes and remit them to respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant water district filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking a judicial determination that respondent city's ordinances were invalid to the extent they required appellant to collect utility users' taxes. Several reasons were listed as to why the tax was invalid including that it constituted an unlawful interference, the collection duty was unconstitutional under Cal. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 6, and respondent had no legal authority to require appellant to collect the tax. The trial court entered judgment for respondent and found that respondent could validly require appellant to collect the taxes. On review, appellant argued that respondent lacked statutory authority to require appellant to collect the tax and the absence of that authority made the requirement invalid. The court affirmed and found that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 37100.5 authorized both the tax and reasonable means for its collection, which could include requiring appellant to collect the tax.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment validating the collection of utility users' taxes. The court held that the requirement that appellant water district collect the tax was authorized as a reasonable means of collection by the same statute that gave respondent city the authority to impose the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of forcible lewd and lascivious conduct on the body of a child under the age of 14, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288(c), and he pleaded guilty to forcible lewd and lascivious conduct on the body of a child under the age of 14, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288(b). Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erred in instructing the jury by defining lewd and lascivious act as any touching with the required intent, and by defining reasonable doubt pursuant to Cal. Jury Instructions - Criminal No. 2.90, and that his motion to dismiss based on pre-information delay was improperly denied. Defendant also brought a petition for a writ of mandate challenging the voluntariness of his guilty plea. The court ruled that the standard jury instructions defining a lewd or lascivious act and reasonable doubt were proper. Further, the court held that no reversal was required on the basis that defendant was denied his right to a speedy trial. The court affirmed the judgment and denied the petition, concluding that defendant was given all the necessary advisements before he pleaded guilty.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 1320 (b), contending that jury instructions violated his presumption of innocence, and invaded the province of the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, defendant testified that he had failed to appear in court to face charges of second degree burglary on two dates, first because his car had broken down, and second because he felt that he had done nothing wrong, and therefore did not need to appear. The trial judge instructed the jury that it was presumed that a defendant who willfully failed to appear within 14 days of the date of his appearance had intended to evade the process of the court. On appeal, defendant contended that the instruction violated his presumption of innocence and the province of the jury. The court held that specific intent to evade the process of the court was an element of the offense under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1320, and the instruction, which included the presumption of willful evasion relieved the prosecution of proving that element, merely by establishing the predicate facts. The court affirmed, reasoning that the error did not prejudice defendant because no rational trier of fact could have concluded from the facts that defendant did not intend to evade process, and held that the instruction did not violate defendant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for second degree burglary and failure to appear, holding that while the jury instruction was constitutionally infirm, the instruction did not prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which applied the presumption of former Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 621 (now Cal. Fam. Code &sect;&sect; 7540, 7541) and granted summary judgment in favor of respondent putative father. The issue was whether the presumption should have been applied in favor of respondent, who denied paternity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While married to another man, appellant mother conceived a child with respondent putative father. The marriage continued, and the husband and child became attached to each other. Appellant and her husband divorced, and the husband was given extensive custody rights. Appellant then filed a paternity action against respondent. He moved for summary judgment and appellant provided no controverting evidence. The lower court applied the presumption of former Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 621 (now Cal. Fam. Code &sect;&sect; 7549, 7541) and granted summary judgment for respondent. On appeal, the court noted that the presumption was a rule of substantive law. Appellant's husband was deemed the child's father, because the child was conceived during their marriage. The presumption was based on, among other things, the welfare of the child and the state's interest in protecting the integrity of the family unit. Appellant had not demonstrated any facts to show that the child would be better off if respondent was legally his father. Parental rights went beyond a biological connection. The facts did not establish a contrary presumption. The statute was constitutional and the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment to respondent putative father. The court held that the undisputed facts supported application of the presumption against appellant mother that the child's father was appellant's ex-husband, because she was married when the child was conceived. Facts to support a contrary presumption were not present in the evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant disputed a conviction for second degree murder in the Superior Court of Riverside County (California). He argued that a jury instruction on implied malice was erroneous, and instructions on self-defense, defense of habitation, and imperfect self-defense should have been given, because his evidence disproved implied malice and there had been instructions on excusable homicide, involuntary manslaughter, and brandishing a firearm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed his girlfriend as her brother was trying to get into his apartment. Defendant claimed that the gun went off accidentally. He was convicted of second degree murder, and he appealed, asserting erroneous jury instructions. The court held that there was no error in instructing the jury on implied malice using the &quot;conscious disregard&quot; definition in Cal. Jury Instructions - Criminal No. 8.11 (5th ed. 1988), rather than the &quot;wanton disregard&quot; definition. The instruction adequately covered the concept that malice required a high probability that defendant's act would result in death, and the &quot;base, antisocial motive&quot; element was not necessary. Instructions on imperfect self-defense, traditional self-defense, and defense of habitation were not required. They were inconsistent with defendant's claim that the gun went off accidentally. Likewise, an instruction on self-defense on the brandishing charge was not necessary, and any error was harmless. There was no evidence that anything would have led defendant to believe that he had to defend his home. He was not entitled to a statutory presumption, because there was no actual entry. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for second degree murder. It was not error to instruct on implied malice using the conscious disregard definition where it fully informed the jury. Instructions on imperfect self-defense, traditional self-defense, and defense of habitation were not required. They were inconsistent with defendant's accidental murder claim. Also, he could not have believed that someone was trying to break into his home.</SPAN></P>

Appellants claimed that moneys from the Drivers Training Penalty Assessment Fund (DTPAF) should have been used for driver training, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1464 and Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 41304. The trial court denied appellants' petition for a writ of mandamus and preliminary injunction. The appeals court affirmed, holding that although fees charged by a high school district for driver training violated the free school guarantee of Cal. Const. art. IX, &sect; 5, DTPAF funds could be used to pay for driver training only if there was an appropriation in the annual Budget Act. The court held that respondent did not breach its contractual obligation to reimburse appellants for driver training expenses, the DTPAF did not constitute a trust fund, and respondent did not violate the equal protection clause, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant foster parents operated a foster home out of their residence in the county. In a federal civil rights action against respondents, state department of social services (DSS), county DSS, and county, appellants contended that their foster home license was wrongfully suspended.

Furthermore, the court held that respondents were entitled to absolute immunity against 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims. Where respondents filed an accusation against appellants and instituted suspension proceedings, the court held that respondents were acting in a prosecutorial role in administrative proceedings and, thus, were entitled to absolute immunity under section 1983. Finally, the court held that in implementing disciplinary action to protect the welfare of foster children under appellants' care, respondents were acting in a prosecutorial role; therefore, respondents were entitled to absolute immunity for their actions causing proceedings to be initiated against appellants.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant disputed a decision of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which dismissed her complaint under the doctrine of res judicata, which had alleged conspiracy between by respondent attorney and another to hide assets. She argued that her claim was not barred by res judicata where dismissal of a prior complaint was not on the merits and the cases did not involve the same primary right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant claimant filed a petition under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1714.10, alleging a conspiracy between respondent attorney and another to hide a client's assets. The petition was dismissed. She filed a second petition after the statute was amended. The trial court dismissed without leave to amend. On appeal, the court held that the first dismissal was a final, appealable order. Her second petition was virtually identical to the first petition, so it was based on the same primary right. By analogy to the federal summary judgment standard, the first dismissal of her statutory petition was a judgment on the merits. Therefore, her second petition was barred by res judicata. The amendment of the statute did not provide her an opportunity to file a new petition. Appellant's claim that the trial judge had unconstitutionally weighed the facts in his decision on the first petition was an issue which should have been raised by an appeal of that decision. The grounds of the first decision were inconsequential; all that mattered was that the trial judge's order was valid. Appellant had no constitutional right to a jury trial, because the matter was an issue of law. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the dismissal of appellant claimant petition, where the court found that her first petition was dismissed by a final order on the merits and the instant petition involved the same primary right. The court held that res judicata was properly applied. The court noted that if there was error in the first dismissal, she should have appealed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A survey company was hired to perform archaeological tests on a portion of an ancient Indian village. The survey company's report proposed that a project to build a museum and a strip mall would cause no adverse effects to the site. Petitioner archaeologist stated that the survey company's report was &quot;poorly done,&quot; and began a letter-writing campaign challenging the report's findings. The survey company filed a complaint against petitioner seeking damages for, among other things, libel, slander, and trade libel. Respondent trial court denied petitioner's motion to strike the complaint. The court held that the suit against petitioner was a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP), as defined under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 425.16(b). Therefore, where petitioner showed that his statements regarding the survey company were made in response to a matter of public concern, petitioner was brought within the protection of section 425.16, which entitled petitioner's statements, even if malicious, to absolute immunity. As such, the court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent to vacate its order denying petitioner's motion to strike the complaint against him.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted based on evidence that she was in possession of large amounts of cash and that she intended to purchase a plane often used by drug smugglers. The court affirmed, finding that the statute did not violate her rights to equal protection and due process, and was not vague or overly broad. The court was not required to subject all criminal classifications to strict scrutiny requiring the showing of a compelling state interest. The legislature rationally limited culpability to possessors of large amounts of cash where the possessor had knowledge of its illegal source. The court held that the state had a legitimate interest in restricting drug trafficking and the statute furthered that interest. The evidence sufficiently showed that the money in defendant's possession was from unlawful drug activities and that defendant knew it. The court did not err in its instructions to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After receiving a dispatch regarding an armed robbery at a motel, officers observed a vehicle driving away from the motel, and stopped the vehicle after discovering the registration was expired, informed defendant why she was stopped, and that they were investigating a robbery. Officers discovered other individuals in the vehicle, matching the descriptions from the dispatch and arrested them. Defendants were convicted of robbery and destruction of phone lines, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211 and &sect; 591, respectively. Defendants appealed contending the trial court erred in denying their motions to suppress evidence because the stop was an illegal pretext to search the vehicle and contended that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654 compelled a stay of their sentences for destruction of phone lines. The court affirmed the convictions and held the stop was proper and not pretextual in nature. The court reasoned that under the objective test, the officers did not exceed the scope of their authority hence, defendants' detention was legally authorized. Further, the court modified the sentences regarding the destruction offenses because the offense was part of the indivisible transaction of the robbery.</SPAN></P>

Further, because the destruction offense arose out of the robbery offense, defendants' sentences were stayed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act, Cal Pub. Res.

When the county declined, appellant petitioned for a writ of administrative mandate to require the county to approve the plan. The trial court denied the petition and appellant sought review. The court noted that while enactment of zoning ordinances was a legitimate use of the police power, if a zoning ordinance impaired the vested right in an existing use of property, the owner's due process right to continued use of the property could overcome the police power. However, the court held that appellant's reclamation plan went far beyond the existing use because it proposed a large increase in the current level of mining on the property. The court affirmed, holding that intensification of a previous use, even if intended by the property owner at the time the zoning ordinance was passed, was not part of appellant's vested rights and did not take precedence over respondent's zoning plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant prisoner contended that he was improperly convicted both of unlawful taking under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 10851 and receiving stolen property under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 496 as to the same stolen vehicle. The court noted that generally the thief could not have been convicted of both the theft and of receiving stolen property. However, a recent change to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 496, meant that the fact that the jury may have found that defendant unlawfully took the pickup no longer barred his conviction for receiving or withholding the pickup. The court stated that if the evidence showed only one continuous violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 10851, in which the driving was part and parcel of the taking, then a conviction for driving or taking under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 10851 was a conviction for theft of the same property which barred conviction under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 496. The court stated that the car was stolen four days before defendant was found driving it. The court held that no reasonable juror could have found that at the time defendant was found driving the vehicle he was still engaged in the original taking; thus, the trial court's order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant prisoner's convictions for driving a stolen vehicle and theft of a vehicle were affirmed because the theft of the vehicle and the driving of the stolen vehicle were two independent crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant citizens, plaintiffs below, challenged the constitutionality of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; l40l6.5, which provided that Medi-Cal beneficiaries would be assigned to and enrolled in a managed care plan unless the Medi-Cal beneficiary timely elected to obtain services from a fee-for-service provider. Appellants had filed a petition for writ of mandamus seeking to restrain implementation of &sect; 14016.5 as an illegal expenditure of public funds, alleging that &sect; 14016.5 violated the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions and violated the right of privacy guaranteed by the state constitution. Appellants contended that this &quot;default&quot; provision forced certain Medi-Cal recipients to be involuntarily enrolled in a managed care plan and denied them their right to choose their own health care provider. The court affirmed, holding that actionable invasions of privacy must have been sufficiently serious in their nature, scope, and actual or potential impact to constitute an egregious breach of the social norms underlying the privacy right.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, Department of Transportation, was responsible for selecting the route for a new freeway. Plaintiff city requested the trial court to declare that the time for selecting a route had expired under Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 100.4 . The trial court held that time had run and enjoined defendant from building a freeway through the city without a freeway agreement pursuant to Cal. Sts. &amp; High. Code &sect; 100.2. Both parties appealed. Defendant claimed that a proposed amendment to &sect; 100.4 would eliminate the debated time limitations and that, therefore, the appeal and cross-appeal was moot. The court affirmed, holding that until the amendment took effect, the time limitations were still in place. Plaintiff argued that the court should broaden the injunction by enforcing against defendant its own policy of obtaining freeway agreements even when not strictly required by &sect; 100.2, that is, when no street would be permanently closed. This assertion was without merit because there was no proposal to build a freeway through the city that did not permanently close any street. The court therefore upheld the injunction as issued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision enjoining defendant, Department of Transportation, from further planning, route approval, and construction of a new freeway because the statutorily prescribed time for selecting a route for the freeway had expired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant business owner appealed the special judgment of the Superior Court of Ventura County (California) that entered a judgment for a penalty assessed by plaintiff Labor Commissioner pursuant to the Workers' Compensation Act, Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3726, against defendant for his failure to obtain workers' compensation insurance in violation of Workers' Compensation Act, Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3700.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff labor commissioner assessed a monetary penalty against defendant business owner under the Workers' Compensation Act, Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3726, for his failure to obtain workers' compensation insurance, and a clerk entered judgment. Defendant alleged that &sect; 3726 violated the separation of powers doctrine, due process, and the principle of check. The court held that the entry of judgment against defendant did not offend any constitutional principles and affirmed the judgment. The court held that Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3 and Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 1 did not prohibit the exercise of &quot;quasi-judicial&quot; functions by an administrative agency. The Workers' Compensation Act authorized plaintiff to adjudicate the penalty imposed on defendant, and the penalty effectuated the agency's primary and legitimate regulatory powers. The principle of check was satisfied because there was an opportunity for judicial review. The clerk's entry of judgment was a ministerial function that did not violate Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3 and the principle of check. Finally, defendant was not denied due process because he was notified of his right to a hearing and chose not to contest the penalty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment entered against defendant business owner because the penalty assessed by plaintiff labor commissioner and entered as a judgment by the clerk did not violate the separation of powers doctrine, due process, or the principle of check. An administrative agency was authorized to impose monetary relief so long as it was authorized by statute, effectuated the agency's primary purposes, and was reviewable by the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant owner of a mobile home park sought a $ 50 rent increase under real party in interest city's rent control ordinance. Respondent mobilehome park rental review board granted an increase of $ 4 per month and appellant filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus, alleging the order lacked sufficient evidence, and a complaint for declaratory relief. The trial court denied the petition and affirmed the order. Plaintiff sought review. The court reversed, ruling that there was no evidence to support respondent's implicit finding that 2.78 percent was a fair rate of return. Real party in interest had used the &quot;historical cost&quot; approach to measure the rate of return and to produce the 2.78 percent rate. However, there was no evidence that investments in which an investor had a potential for capital appreciation and possible tax shelter benefits provided returns of a similar nature, or that the rate was otherwise appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner gave a progress payment to a general contractor to pay subcontractors for work completed on the construction of a hotel.

Defendant bank declared a note owed by the general contractor due and set off its claim against the checking account. Defendant returned checks already paid and noted that the checks were paid in error. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendant because plaintiff had no standing as a non-customer to bring an action against defendant. The court reversed and held that a contract between plaintiff and the general contractor created a trust as to the progress payment funds. Accordingly, plaintiff as the settlor had standing to bring the action. The court concluded that there was a triable issue of fact as to whether defendant had actual notice of facts rendering the progress payment a trust fund or if it knew facts that would lead a reasonable person to inquire if the general contractor was acting as a trustee of funds.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendants violated state regulations by failing to discuss placing the baby with extended family, to discuss educational or employment resources, to give plaintiffs copies of the executed documents, and to obtain one plaintiff's medical history. The court concluded that plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of proof to show prejudice from any regulatory violations and therefore failed to prove constructive fraud.

Defendant appealed, arguing the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and asserting the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction. The court held that the statute was not overbroad because it criminalized true threats, and not political hyperbole or jokes. The statute only proscribed threats that were unconditional, immediate and so specific as to convey a gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of being carried through, and did not prohibit speech protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. The court found that substantial evidence established that defendant intended her threats to be taken as true threats. Though defendant's threats were conditionally stated, the context in which they were made established that defendant had the specific intent that her statements be taken seriously.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant criminal appealed his conviction and sentence from the Superior Court of San Diego County (California) on child molestation charges. Defendant claimed his prior acts of child molestation should not have been admitted, the victims should not have been allowed to testify in the presence of a support person, and the sentencing enhancement was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of committing a lewd or lascivious act on a child, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288(a), (c), and annoying and molesting a child, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647.6. On appeal, defendant contended that prior acts of child molestation should not have been admitted, that the victims should not have been allowed to testify with a support person present, and that the enhancement sentence should be set aside because the prior charges were not brought and tried separately. The court held prior acts of abuse were properly admitted because they showed the requisite mental state for a lewd or lascivious conviction, established distinctive similarities that satisfied the standard to establish identity, and were not prejudicial because the probative value outweighed the prejudicial effect. The court held the presence of a support person did not prevent a face-to-face confrontation, that the state sufficiently met the standards set forth in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 868.5, and that defendant's failure to object at trial waived the issue for appeal. The court affirmed the conviction and the sentencing enhancement because there was one prior conviction for two crimes tried in a single trial.</SPAN></P>

The court found that a jury instruction on unanimity was not required because the case fell within the continuous course of conduct exception. Defendant's various acts were repetitive, occurred over a period of time, and were thus continuing in nature. Though the individual acts may not have amounted to torture, the cumulative effect was illegal. Because the continuous course of conduct exception applied to the torture charge, the trial court did not err in failing to give an instruction on unanimity.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, store owners, sought review of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which dismissed their action challenging an ordinance for nuisance abatement enacted by respondent city. Appellants claimed the ordinance, which required appellants to obtain a conditional use permit, was unconstitutional because it violated Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 23790(a)(b), Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 52.1, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, store owners, sought review of the lower court's dismissal of their claim alleging respondent city's enactment of an ordinance, which required them to obtain conditional use permits in order to continue to sell alcoholic beverages, was preempted by state law and violated Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 23790(a), (b), Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 52.1, and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The record revealed that the ordinance was directed at nuisance abatement. The court held that &sect; 23790(a), (b) exempted from zoning ordinances those stores that predated the enactment of the ordinance if they retained the same type of license and the premises operated continuously. Because appellants met these exceptions, the court reversed the grant of summary judgment on appellants' second cause of action. The court affirmed the dismissal as to &sect; 52.1 and &sect; 1983 because appellants failed to allege violations of the rights of the protected classes set forth in the statutes and failed to claim that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment for respondent city was reversed in part. Appellants, store owners, could not be required to obtain a conditional use permit because they retained the same type of license and operated continuously. The judgment was otherwise affirmed because appellants failed to allege the type of rights violations covered by statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant minor sought review of a ruling from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which determined that the allegations made in the state's petition, filed under Cal.

Code, &sect;&sect; 2.69.030, 2.69.060. 2.69.070 (1992), were true, and that appellant was properly adjudged a ward of the state, and placed on home probation.</SPAN></P>

Code, &sect;&sect; 2.69.030, 2.69.060. 2.69.070 (1992), and on appeal challenged the curfew on constitutional grounds. the city had enacted the curfew ordinance in response to civil unrest that included rioting, looting, and arson, the violation of which was a misdemeanor. Appellant claimed that the ordinance was facially overbroad and unconstitutionally restricted various rights and liberties, including the right to travel, the right to associate, the right to assemble, and the right to free speech, as protected under U.S. Const. amends. I, V, and XIV. The court affirmed the lower court determination, holding that the curfew regulation was properly enacted by the municipality by its authority under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 8634, and that the ordinance did not offend constitutional precepts because the restrictions imposed relative to outdoor assembly between the hours of 7 P.M. and 6 A.M. were reasonably related to a compelling government interest of ensuring the safety and welfare of persons and property in the municipality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment finding appellant minor in violation of a curfew ordinance, ruling that appellant was not exempt from the operation of the curfew ordinance. The court also ruled that the curfew ordinance was constitutional, rejecting claims that it was vague or overbroad, and that it lent itself to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attorney appealed an order from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which confirmed an arbitration award in favor of plaintiff law firm, including punitive damages, in plaintiff's suit for breach of contract.

The trial court confirmed the award and defendant appealed, contending that lack of judicial review of punitive damages violated his due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. The court, however, affirmed, finding that the arbitrator had not exceeded his powers under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1286.6(b), that U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, did not control private arbitration proceedings because they did not constitute state action, and that judicial enforcement of the arbitrator's punitive damage award did not, as a matter of due process, need to include judicial review of the merits of the award.

The trial court found that the murder occurred during a robbery and imposed a life sentence without possibility of parole. Defendant sought review and contended that the special circumstance robbery murder finding under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.5 constituted cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII and violated due process under amend. XIV. He also argued that the trial court erred when it denied a jury trial for the penalty phase and that the life sentence was disproportionately severe. The court affirmed. It found that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.5 was not unconstitutional because the statutory guidelines, which gave a judge discretion to consider mitigation and aggravation, were not arbitrary and capricious and did not violate due process. The court found that a jury was not appropriate for the penalty phase because under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.5, the court, and not a jury, had the power to exercise discretion in a special circumstances murder. Finally, the sentence was not disproportionately severe either to defendant's crime or his personal culpability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of selling methamphetamine in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11379. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in ordering him, as a condition of probation, to repay the county the sum it expended in the controlled drug buy that resulted in defendant's conviction because the county was not a victim of his crime. The court disagreed. Under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.04,(a)(l), defendant was required to make restitution to the victim as a condition of probation The policies of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 1203.1 and 1203.04 favored a definition of &quot;victim&quot; that included the government if it suffered loss flowing from a defendant's criminal conduct. In this case, the county incurred an actual loss due to the unlawful acts of defendant. The existence of a civil remedy under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11501 did not preclude such an order of restitution because the civil remedy was not intended as an exclusive one. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the conviction. The court noted that the jury was instructed concerning the necessity of unanimity and was presumed to have complied absent evidence to the contrary. The court held that even in the case of a resident child molester in which the only evidence presented by the state is of a series of separate but indistinguishable acts, the unanimity instruction is sufficient to protect a defendant's right to a unanimous jury so long as there is substantial evidence to support the convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff accountants filed a complaint against defendant company alleging breach of contract, bad faith denial of contract, and quantum meruit in connection with an unpaid bill for accounting services. After a jury verdict in plaintiffs' favor, the trial court corrected the jury's damage awards for compensatory and punitive damages on plaintiffs' motion. Defendant appealed the trial court's judgment, alleging that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to correct the damages and that the award of damages for the tort of bad faith denial of contract was improper. Plaintiff appealed the trial court's refusal to permit an amendment of the complaint to add a cause of action for fraud. The court held that the trial court erred in correcting the judgment where there was no clerical error and the judgment conformed to the jury's verdict. The court also determined that the award of punitive damages for the tort of bad faith denial of a contract was improper because there was no special relationship between the parties indicative of unequal bargaining positions. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for a new trial on the limited issue of breach of contract damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of two counts of spousal abuse, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 273.5 and four counts of spousal rape, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 262. Defendant claimed that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 273.5&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated against persons like himself because it excluded from its scope persons who did the same thing to persons of the same sex. The reviewing court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court found that the statute was not subject to strict scrutiny merely because it was a criminal law that could result in incarceration. Rather, the rational basis test applied. Because the state had an interest in preventing domestic violence in opposite-sex relationships, the omission of same-sex relationships from Cal. Penal Code &sect; 273.5 did not render the statute so irrational or invidiously discriminatory as to be unconstitutional. The court concluded that the legislature did not have to choose between attacking every aspect of the problem of domestic violence or not attacking the problem at all.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction because the spousal abuse statute did not violate equal protection merely because it omitted same-sex relationships from its regulation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city clerk and others sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which issued a writ of mandate that declared unconstitutional an ordinance regulating circulators of referendary petitions in an action brought by respondent restaurants, tobacco manufacturers, and others.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a city published an ordinance prohibiting smoking in restaurants, respondents, a group of restaurants, tobacco manufacturers and others, attempted to qualify a referendum to repeal the ordinance. However, appellant city clerk determined that the petition did not have the required number of qualified signatures because the persons who had circulated portions of the petition were not city residents and registered voters, as required by municipal ordinance. Respondents filed a petition for a writ of mandate. The trial court issued a writ and ordered that no signatures were to be disqualified because of the ordinance. On appeal, the court reversed. Although the circulation of initiative petitions involved core political speech, respondents failed to show that the residency and registration requirements of the ordinance limited the opportunity of city residents and voters to hear about and discuss the petition. Moreover, the city had a compelling interest in the integrity of the referendum process that the ordinance protected. Charter cities could provide for the exercise of the power of referendum in any manner that did not impinge on the basic right of referendum.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that granted the petition for a writ of mandate brought by respondent restaurants, tobacco manufacturers, and others. The court held that the residency and voter registration requirements for persons who circulated ordinances did not unduly burden respondents' right of political expression and protected the referendum process from special interests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant rent stabilization board enacted regulations providing for an increase in rent levels and for future annual general adjustments to rent.

Plaintiffs, tenant's organization and city, challenged these regulations and contended that defendant's actions were in excess of defendant's authority. The trial court rejected defendant's grant of inflation adjustments to rental properties purchased after 1979 but upheld all other aspects of implemented regulations as within defendant's power. Plaintiff city appealed judgment upholding regulations. Defendants board and intervener property owners association appealed the denial of regulations' applicability to post-1979 purchasers. The reviewing court found no prejudicial abuse of discretion. Defendant's actions were consistent with its authority and consistent with case law determinations.

Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant father's children were taken into protective custody after appellant kicked one of them, causing injuries. The children were then declared dependents of the trial court for the second time and were placed with their grandparents or in foster homes. Appellant was incarcerated during most of the first six months of reunification and upon release entered a residential alcohol rehabilitation facility. He visited the children on a weekly basis. The trial court continued appellant's reunification services for a time, but ultimately found that the youngest daughter was adoptable, severed appellant's parental rights, and referred the daughter for adoptive placement. Appellant sought review of the decision. The court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that the statutory exception to placement for adoption where a benefit from continuing the parent/child relationship was found, under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26(c)(1)(A), was clear and not violative of appellant's right to due process and that substantial evidence supported the order terminating appellant's parental rights and freeing the daughter for adoption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which terminated her parental rights to her four minor children. Appellant claimed that she had been wrongfully deprived of counsel at a permanency planning hearing held pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At a permanency planning hearing held pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 366.26, at which appellant mother was not present and without any prior notice, appellant's counsel's request to be relieved was granted. Appellant's parental rights were subsequently terminated at the conclusion of the hearing. The appellate court affirmed. Pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 317(d), appellant had the right to be represented at the hearing. However, that right was not of constitutional dimension at a &sect; 366.26 hearing because at that stage of the proceedings it had already been determined that appellant could not have custody of her children. Because the right to counsel was statutory, the trial court's error in depriving appellant of an attorney at the hearing could not require reversal unless prejudice was shown pursuant to Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 13. The appellate court determined that there was no prejudice shown, and any error was harmless because the facts established that the trial court was amply justified in deciding that adoption was in the children's best interests, and the result would not have been different even if counsel was appointed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the order that terminated appellant mother's parental rights because, although the trial court erred by depriving appellant of counsel during a permanency planning hearing, the error was not reversible per se and was harmless in any event where the circumstances were such that counsel being present could not have changed the outcome of the hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Medical Board of California sought reversal of the order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, issuing a preliminary injunction against appellant and enjoining it from going forward with respondent physician's disciplinary proceedings until respondent had the opportunity to take the depositions that he requested.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Medical Board of California filed an accusation against respondent physician for gross negligence and incompetence. A disciplinary hearing was scheduled and respondent noticed several depositions, which appellant informed were not authorized. Respondent filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in superior court alleging that the Administrative Procedure Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11511, denied him equal protection by restricting prehearing depositions in disciplinary proceedings to witnesses whose testimony was material and who were unable to attend the hearing, when such depositions were not similarly restricted in attorney disciplinary proceedings. The trial court found in favor of respondent and issued a preliminary injunction, and appellant sought reversal. The court reversed the ruling of the superior court and concluded that a physician had no fundamental right to continue to practice his or her profession. Therefore, the court applied the rational basis test rather than the strict scrutiny test, and found that Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11511 had a rational basis, as the state had an interest in swiftly and expeditiously disciplining physicians.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the superior court and held that the Administrative Procedure Act did not violate respondent physician's equal protection right by denying him the opportunity to depose witnesses in preparation for his administrative disciplinary hearing. Respondent did not have a fundamental right to practice medicine, and the statute had a rational basis in the state's interest in streamlining the procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A minor was arrested and charged with murder and her full name and image were broadcast by the media at her arrest a few days before a detention hearing in juvenile court.

The juvenile court issued an order directing one of petitioner media representatives to show cause why it should not have been held in contempt. On appeal, the court vacated the juvenile court's minute order and its order to show cause regarding contempt. The court held that murder was one of the serious offenses that opened the door to a public hearing under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;&sect; 676(a), (b). Petitioners had a statutory right to attend the hearing and a constitutional right to say what transpired.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant murderer challenged an order from the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), that denied appellant's counsel's request for the addresses and telephone number of eight jurors, whom requested that such information not be disclosed, on the ground that the disclosure statute,&nbsp;Cal Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 206, was an unconstitutional invasion of the jurors' right to privacy, and that it prohibited any contact with those jurors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant murderer was sentenced to death, the trial court, after hearing, refused to release addresses and telephone numbers of eight jurors that objected to that information being releasing to appellant's counsel, and it issued a no contact order that prohibited appellant's counsel or their investigators from contacting those eight jurors. The appellate court affirmed. The appellate court observed that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 206 protected jurors from unwanted postverdict intrusions by giving them an absolute right to not discuss deliberations or the verdict with anyone, Cal Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 206(a), and requiring their consent before contact.  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 206(b). Further, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 237 strengthened juror protections by permitting sealing juror information after a criminal case when there was a compelling governmental interest.  Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 237(b). The appellate court held that a juror's refusal to discuss deliberations or the case was a compelling interest sufficient to keep the juror's information sealed, and in that situation Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 207(f) did not apply.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order that prohibited appellant's counsel from contacting any juror that exercised the right to not discuss the case or verdict and that withheld consent to contact, and thereby denied appellant's petition for writ of mandate, because after a juror exercised that absolute right there was a continuing compelling governmental interest which authorized keeping juror personal information sealed.</SPAN></P>

Instead the court held that the dispositive issue presented was whether Proposition A impermissibly conflicted with either respondent's general plan or state law provisions litigated at trial. The court reversed the judgment, holding that Proposition A was facially in conflict with respondent's general plan and with state planning and zoning law. The court held that a zoning ordinance that conflicts with a general plan is invalid at the time it is passed. The court further held that the court did not invalidate the ordinance, but only determined the existence of the conflict. It is the preemptive effect of the controlling state statute which invalidated the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife sought a divorce from appellee husband, claiming an interest in real property that he owned before their marriage that the parties held as joint tenants. The trial court held that appellant had a one-half interest in the parcels. Appellee then sought a new trial based on his assertion that a very recent California Supreme Court decision permitted retroactive application of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.2. The trial court granted a partial new trial to give appellee an opportunity to claim reimbursement for his separate property contributions in the real property acquisitions. On review sought by appellant, the court affirmed the grant of a new trial. The court found that appellee's failure to ask the trial court to reject or limit the binding California Supreme Court decision and to specify if his motion rested upon affidavits or the trial court minutes were not fatal to his new trial motion. The court reasoned that the new trial motion rested on application of legal principles that a recent decision declared, and that specification of affidavits or the minutes of the trial court would not have assisted either appellant or the trial court regarding the new trial motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the partial grant of appellee husband's motion for a new trial in appellant wife's divorce suit as to his right to reimbursement for jointly held property that he owned before their marriage. The court held that errors in filing appellee's motion were not fatal because he relied on recently declared principles, and specifying affidavits or the minutes of the trial court would not have helped appellant or the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent health care providers challenged the constitutionality of 1987 Cal. Stat. 1237, which provided that an unemancipated minor could not obtain a therapeutic abortion without first having obtained the written consent of a parent or legal guardian, or by petitioning the juvenile court. After the superior court declared the legislation unconstitutional and enjoined the state from enforcing Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 34.5, as amended by 1987 Cal. Stat. 1237, as well as provisions of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 25958, the court remanded for factual determinations regarding whether the legislation burdened the right to privacy. On remand, the superior court held that respondents made a prima facie showing of an unconstitutional invasion of the right of privacy, but that the state failed to show that the burden on the right was justified by the interests which the legislation sought to further. On appeal sought by the state, the court affirmed the judgment and order of injunction, holding that, while the health and welfare of minors is a compelling state interest, the legislation in question did not further this interest, but instead, burdened the fundamental privacy rights of minors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court enjoining the state's implementation of statutory provisions amended by legislation, where the legislation was shown to unconstitutionally impinge on the fundamental privacy rights of minors by requiring them to obtain parental consent prior to an abortion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city approved a tentative map, giving plaintiff developers a vested right to proceed with development of a residential subdivision. Six weeks later, defendant city agreed to collect fees for defendant county.

The trial court granted judgment for plaintiffs declaring that the fees violated Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 65961 and a peremptory writ mandating the issuance of permits and the refund of fees already paid on 26 units. Both parties appealed. The court reversed and awarded costs to defendants. The court held that because defendant city could not have lawfully imposed a condition requiring payment of impact fees in the future, it was not barred by &sect; 65961 from subsequently imposing the condition on permits. The court held that any due process right to develop free of fees did not vest until issuance of the permits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant developer challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which found in favor of respondent city on appellant's claims for breach of contract, promissory estoppel, various statutory violations, and declaratory relief. Appellant asserted that the trial court erred in awarding judgment to respondent on the pleadings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing, respondent city granted appellant developer a conditional use permit to construct an apartment project. After construction began, respondent determined that appellant's list of parties omitted several property owners who were entitled to notice. Based on complaints and the inadequate notice, respondent revoked appellant's permit. Eventually, appellant was granted a permit for a significantly scaled back project. Appellant brought an action against respondent for damages arising out of the revocation of the original conditional use permit and building permit. The trial court granted judgment to respondent on the pleadings. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed appellant's action on the pleadings because he failed to seek administrative mandamus under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1094.5, before bringing his action for damages. The court held that respondent was not estopped from raising the mandamus requirement for failure to give appellant notice under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;1094.6(b), because the application of estoppel would not punish respondent but would injure the area residents who could not be held responsible for respondent's mistakes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment granted by the trial court on the pleadings in favor of respondent city in appellant developer's action for money damages resulting from a revoked land use permit. An administrative mandamus was the proper method to challenge the validity of conditions imposed on a building permit, and appellant had failed to pursue this remedy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a domestic disturbance call officers conducted a warrantless search of defendants' residence and found marijuana, cocaine, and a triple beam scale. Defendants pleaded guilty to various narcotics offenses after the trial court denied their motions to suppress the evidence found in the search, because exigent circumstances justified the officers' warrantless entry into defendants' residence. The court found the motions were properly suppressed and affirmed the trial court's judgment. It reasoned that the officers were called to defendants' residence in response to a report of physical violence. When they encountered the female defendant, she was extremely frightened and appeared to be the victim of a felony battery. She also lied about being alone and gave the officers a suspicious story about falling down the stairs. The court reasoned that viewed objectively, the circumstances justified the officers' entry and search of the residence to ensure the female defendant's safety. The court could not say, as a matter of law, that the officers' failure to procure a warrant rendered their actions unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant vessel owners filed suit to bar enforcement of a regional agency ordinance which, among other things, prohibited the offshore mooring of residential-use vessels for periods longer than 30 days. Respondent San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission (BCDC) intervened as a defendant to protect its interest in enforcement of the ordinance and its special area plan. The McAteer-Petris Act required permits before persons or entities could have placed fill within areas of the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission's jurisdiction. The court found an injunction by the lower court in favor of respondent was supported because the vessels were &quot;fill&quot; under the McAteer-Petris Act, Cal. Gov't. Code tit. 7.2, &sect; 66632(a), and moored without required permits from respondent. The court further found there was no evidence that any of the appellants had ceased mooring their vessels or obtained the required permits before judgment. The fact that the vessels were capable of navigation or self-propulsion did not entitle appellants to indefinitely moor the vessels offshore in violation of the statute and without permits.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the dismissal order of the trial court because the arresting officer did have probable cause to arrest defendant. The probable cause consisted of drug paraphernalia being found in the car and the caller who paged defendant in order to buy drugs. The court also held that it was permissible to stop a vehicle for having illegal window tinting and the 20-minute investigative detention was proper because the officer was authorized to detain defendant until he completed investigation of the violation and wrote the citation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California), which convicted him of possession of a firearm by a felon, based on his prior conviction for petty theft with a prior theft conviction under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 666(3). Defendant admitted the priors in the petty theft proceeding and was sentenced to a state prison term, suspended, and placed on probation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021(a) and held that defendant was not entitled to an instruction asking the jury to determine whether his prior conviction for petty theft with a prior under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 666(3) was a felony or a misdemeanor. Whether an offense was a felony or a misdemeanor was a question of law to be decided by the court. The trial court correctly determined that defendant's petty theft conviction was for a felony. Defendant was sentenced to the state prison, and his conviction was not a misdemeanor under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 17(b). The court held that defendant was properly sentenced under the indeterminate sentencing law in effect at the time of his trial. The fact that his prison term was suspended and probation granted did not make his petty theft conviction a misdemeanor. Defendant's mistaken belief that he had not been convicted of a felony in the petty theft case was not a defense to the current charge. The court held that defendant voluntarily and knowingly admitted the prior conviction in his previous trial for petty theft and rejected his Yurko error claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession of a firearm by a felon holding that his prior conviction for petty theft with a prior was a felony because he was sentenced to state prison, that determination of whether the petty theft conviction was a felony or misdemeanor was a question of law for the court, and that defendant's mistaken belief that he had not been convicted of a felony was not a defense to the current charge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of cultivation of marijuana under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11358, was convicted after he reached a plea bargain agreement with prosecution. Following the conviction prosecution sought and received a forfeiture of defendant's firearms under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12028. Defendant appealed respondent judge's refusal to allow him to withdraw his plea of guilty and filed a petition for writ of mandate to order respondent to issue an order returning defendant's firearms to him. The court reversed respondent's forfeiture order and granted the petition for writ of mandate because the requirements of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12028 had not been met. The court held that respondent had erred when it held that the firearms could be confiscated without any hearing because the underlying crime to which he pled did not necessarily involve the use of any firearms and the factual basis for the plea did not expressly admit use of any guns. Because the court held that the firearms were improperly confiscated there was no ground upon which defendant could withdraw his plea and his conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's petition for writ of mandate was granted because there was no basis for declaring defendant's firearms a nuisance. The order by respondent judge which confiscated defendant's firearms was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, purportedly enacting a practical joke, burned a cross on the lawn of an interracial couple. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 11411 (1982) (statute), did not violate U.S. Const. Amend. I's guarantee of free speech because unauthorized cross burning on another's property was within the scope of the true threat doctrine and the fighting words doctrine. The court did not find the statute overbroad as applied to defendant because, although he claimed he did not intend to terrorize, the true threat doctrine only required intent to perform the act. The court held that the statute did not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of content because the intent of the statute was to protect specific victims from immediate injury, it targeted secondary effects of malicious cross burning, and it was not intended to suppress ideas. The statute was not found to be vague because it required that the offender know the symbolism of the desecrated object and have acted to terrorize or in reckless disregard of the risk. Additionally, the court found no equal protection violation. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that the statute addressed two behaviors: willful, malicious, repeated following, or willful, malicious harassment. The trial court held that the term &quot;repeatedly&quot; only applied to willful, malicious, repeated following, and therefore, even if it was a vague term, it would not affect defendant's conviction under the willful and malicious harassment provision. The court affirmed, holding that substantial evidence supported defendant's stalking conviction based on a harassment theory, including testimony that he placed unwanted calls to his victim, showed up at her workplace, left threatening notes and wrote threatening messages on her car, appeared at her home and was violent, and damaged her car. The court further held that even if defendant was convicted under the willful, malicious and repeated following provision, his conviction was constitutional because &quot;repeatedly&quot; was a word of such common understanding that its meaning was not vague.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2000bb-1 required the application of the compelling state interest test. The court also held that the state constitutional provisions protecting the right to obtain housing and right to privacy were not violated. The court decided that the contention that a state statute prohibiting discrimination by a business establishment had to yield to appellant's paramount right to free exercise and enjoyment of religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile offender appealed a decision from the Superior Court No, 165471of San Diego County (California), which convicted defendant of robbery with the use of a firearm pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 602. Defendant asserted the judge lacked jurisdiction, insufficient evidence to support the findings, and that the trial court erred in refusing to admit polygraph test results in support of defendant's motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile offender commenced with a friend to rob victim at gunpoint as victim was walking home from work one evening. Victim later identified defendant which led to defendant's arrest and conviction. He was convicted of robbery with the use of a firearm. He asserted that the judge lacked jurisdiction, that there was insufficient evidence to support the findings, and that the trial court erred in refusing to admit polygraph test results in support of a motion for new trial. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the requirement of a written stipulation was directory, and the absence of a writing in this case did not deprive the court of jurisdiction. The court also found sufficient evidence to support the findings. Finally, it concluded that the probative value of the polygraph was insufficient to outweigh the collateral problems of such tests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court holding the oral stipulation to the judge was sufficient, sufficient evidence to support the findings, and the trial court properly excluded defendant's post trial effort to admit favorable polygraph test results because polygraphs were inherently unreliable or the little probative value garnered from the tests was outweighed by the prejudice and confusion entailed in their introduction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted by a jury of nine counts of robbery and one count of discharging a firearm with gross negligence. Defendant was sentenced to a 23-year, 8-month state prison term. Upon appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held a special instruction regarding force and fear was improper because it established elements of the offense of robbery and that was the role of the jury. The court found, however, the error was nonreversible where neither force nor fear were at issue and the jury could not have reasonably concluded force and fear were not established where they found defendant aimed a gun at a victim in demand for money. The court held defendant's confession was not rendered involuntary by the investigator telling him he would talk to the district attorney if defendant told the truth because there was no actual threat or promise. The court held that under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code 1731.5, the trial court was not bound by a Youth Authority housing recommendation. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654 was not violated where defendant was punished separately for firing a shotgun where the violent offenses involved different victims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land owner challenged the denial of its petition for writ of mandate by the Superior Court of Marin County (California), in an action seeking to overturn the decision of respondent conservation and development commission which determined it had jurisdiction over appellant's land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land owner sought to construct a hotel on its property. Respondent conservation and development commission claimed jurisdiction over the majority of appellant's property. The court held that the plain language of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 66610 (1969) stated that, except as to marshlands, the shoreline of the bay was to be set with reference to the specified level of &quot;mean high tide&quot; and not, as respondent contended, at the line of maximum inundation by occasional and exceptional high tides. The court noted that this measure of tidelands had been consistently adopted by California law. Consequently, the court held that the landward two-thirds of appellant's property, which was not shown to lie less than 100 feet beyond the level of mean high tide, was not within respondent's jurisdiction. However, the bayward one-third was marshland lying lower than five feet above mean sea level and did come within respondent's jurisdiction. The court reversed that portion of the judgment establishing respondent's jurisdiction at the record high tide level, affirmed its jurisdiction as to the marshland portion of appellant's land, and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the denial of appellant land owner's petition for writ of mandate with respect to the establishment of respondent conservation and development commission's jurisdiction over property because the statute authorized jurisdiction at the &quot;mean high tide&quot; level. The court affirmed the denial with respect to the marshland portion because that was clearly within respondent's jurisdiction and remanded.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and was a prior restraint on appellant's freedoms under U.S. Const. amend. I. The court found that the ordinance delegated subjective discretion to county officials without setting forth narrow, objective, and definite standards for denying CUP's to adult businesses, which were to be focussed on the secondary effect of such businesses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants parents of decedent whose son died as the result of a police pursuit, challenged the trial court's grant of summary judgment to respondent city based on respondent 's immunity from injuries arising out of vehicle pursuits under Cal.

Appellants contended that respondent's vehicle pursuit policy did not qualify respondent for immunity under &sect; 17004.7, that the policy was illusory, and that the policy's guidelines did not satisfy Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 17004.7). The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that respondent's policy qualified for immunity under &sect; 17004.7 because it was promulgated by the chief of police as head of a public agency, and that adoption of the policy in accordance with the statutory requirements triggered the immunity, regardless of the policy's actual implementation. The court further held that the policy did not leave officers with unfettered discretion, and that respondent did not waive the immunity defense despite its failure to cite to &sect; 17004.7 in its answer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which convicted defendant of attempted murder under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187, 664(1) that was deliberate and premeditated. The jury also convicted defendant of possession by a convicted felon of a firearm under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021, and discharge of a firearm at an occupied automobile under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 246. The court affirmed the conviction and found that although the information charged defendant with attempted murder, it did not allege that the murder was deliberate and premeditated. However, the court held that the failure of the information to allege separately that the crime was deliberate and premeditated was a &quot;formal&quot; defect and that defendant raised no persuasive claim of prejudice, and thus it was harmless error because defendant was aware of the &quot;lying in wait&quot; theory of the prosecution, the classic theory of premeditation. The court found that the trial court was proper when it sent the jury back to continue deliberations on premeditation after it returned a verdict of first degree attempted murder, because premeditation was encompassed within the attempted murder charged, and the prosecution argued premeditation to the jury without objection by defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for deliberate and premeditated attempted murder and held that it was harmless error for the information which charged defendant to not specify premeditation because, defendant was aware of the prosecution's argument that defendant was lying in wait, which was the classic premeditation theory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant board of equalization sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which found a use tax imposed upon respondent company under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent company, an out-of-state mail-order business, was acquired by a corporation with considerable contacts within California. Appellant board of equalization imposed a use tax upon respondent, relying on Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 6203(g), which imposed collection responsibility upon any retailer controlled by the same interests that controlled any retailer engaged in business in the same or similar line of business in the state. Appellant challenged the lower court's ruling that the use tax was unconstitutional as applied to respondent. The court affirmed the lower court's decision, after evaluating whether the acquisition of respondent by a corporation created a substantial nexus between respondent and the taxing state of California. The court found that respondent and its acquiring corporation were organized and operated as separate and distinct corporate entities, and neither was the agent of the other for any purpose. The court ruled, therefore, that respondent's physical nexus with the state was insufficient to justify the imposition of a use tax, and that &sect;6203(g), as applied to respondent, was unconstitutional as violative of the commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's finding that the tax statute was unconstitutional as violative of the commerce clause as applied to respondent company because respondent and its parent company were organized as separate corporate entities, and respondent's physical nexus with the state was insufficient to justify the imposition of a use tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following an adverse judgment, plaintiff agent sought indemnity from defendant principal under Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 317(e)(4). While defendant appealed the order granting indemnification, plaintiff filed an amended complaint for breach of contract theories and for equitable estoppel. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer without leave to amend on the ground that there was another action pending on the same cause of action. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the trial court should have decided the rights of the parties on the issues in the second action because the prior litigation had not been determined on the merits. The court also held that the prior corporate agency indemnity action under &sect; 317(e)(4) did not have res judicata or collateral estoppel effect because the primary right to seek authorization for indemnity under &sect; 317(e)(4) was not the same as the actions for breach of a contract for indemnity or under the doctrine of equitable estoppel and because the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not apply where the issues relating to contractual indemnity and equitable estoppel were not before the court in the prior action..</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which sentenced him to life without the possibility of parole under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12310, following remand by the court which affirmed his conviction of first degree murder for causing the death of a child. Defendant claimed that his sentence violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 17, as being cruel and unusual and that the trial court abused its discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder for his involvement in throwing a molotov cocktail into a house and thus causing the death of a two year old boy. His judgment was affirmed by the court in a prior proceeding, but the case was remanded to the trial court to chose either a 25-year to life sentence under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187 or life without possibility of parole under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12310. The trial court sentenced defendant to the latter. Defendant challenged the sentence as cruel and unusual in violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court affirmed his sentence and held that the only mitigating circumstance was defendant's youth; however, there was no evidence that defendant was immature and did not foresee the risk he was creating. Further, the legislature determined that the crime carried a heavier sentence than a premeditated killing because of the use of a destructive device that marked defendant as a greater danger to society. The court also found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in selecting life without the possibility of parole because of the extraordinarily dangerous nature of the crime and defendant's level of participation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court which imposed the sentence of life without the possibility of parole because defendant's sentence was not cruel and unusual punishment because of the extraordinarily dangerous nature of defendant's crime of throwing a molotov cocktail through a window and thereby causing the death of a child.</SPAN></P>

The elements of collateral estoppel were met in this case because the issue and parties were identical to that in the former proceeding, the issue was actually litigated and decided, and the decision was final on the merits. However, collateral estoppel did not apply because the defendant's right to present a defense outweighed any other public policy or judicial economy considerations.</SPAN></P>

Respondent general assistance recipients challenged the ordinance and were granted a peremptory writ of mandate, which barred appellant's implementation of the changes. Appellant sought review on the grounds that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 17000.5 allowed the changes. The court affirmed in part with modifications, holding that while appellant could reduce shelter benefits by the value of housing provided to respondents, it could not reduce them by the value of shelter benefits not actually received nor available to respondents. Because the benefit reductions in other parts of the program were authorized under the safe harbor provisions of &sect; 17000.5, the court held that appellant was not required to justify those reductions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City of Rancho Palos Verdes approved respondent real estate developer's application for a coastal development permit, and notified appellant California Coastal Commission. An appeal of the permit decision was filed after the time limit required by Cal. Pub. Res. Code &sect; 30603(c), but within the time limit required by appellant's regulation under Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, &sect; 13111(b). Appellant approved the permit, but with conditions unsatisfactory to respondent. Respondent sought a writ of mandate. The trial court granted and ordered appellant to vacate the permit, and dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court affirmed, holding that the &sect; 30603(c) provision allowing appeals to be filed within 10 working days after local government action controlled, and the provision of &sect; 13111(b) allowing appeals to be filed within 10 days of receipt of such notice action was void to the extent that it allowed appeals to be filed outside the time limit. The court also held that &sect; 30603(c) permitted local government to require filing of a notice of final action with appellant, and that it did not prejudice the appeal rights of third parties.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent county auditor to ignore &sect;&sect; 97.02 and 97.035, and to disburse property tax receipts in accordance with the ordinance. The court affirmed denial of the writ and held that &sect;&sect; 97.02 and 97.035 did not violate the home rule provisions of Cal. Const. art. XIII A because appellant's taxing power was neither destroyed nor annulled. The court held that appellant's ordinance was void because it conflicted with proper state law and appellant had not been empowered to enact legislation in this tax area. The court ruled that appellant lacked the standing to challenge the constitutionality of Cal. Ed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner's association appealed from the denial by the Superior Court of El Dorado County (California), of its request for a preliminary injunction against defendants, governmental water and resource agencies, to preclude defendants' collection of further per lot mitigation fees paid for construction permits, and to require collected mitigation fees to be paid over to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, governmental water and resource agencies, reclassified the area in which members of plaintiff home owner's association lived so that they could obtain building permits upon their paying a mitigation fee which would be used to accomplish relevant water control plans. Plaintiff sought to permanently enjoin further collection of the mitigation fee and for a refund of collected fees. Plaintiff appealed the denial of its request for a preliminary injunction. The court affirmed, holding that plaintiff failed to make a showing of irreparable injury, as there was no threat to plaintiff being fully compensated, and, considering the public interest, there was significant potential harm to defendants, as they would have to bring multiple claims to collect refunded or uncollected mitigation fees. The court also held that there was little likelihood of plaintiff's success on the merits. Plaintiff's &quot;Takings Clause&quot; claim only involved regulatory restrictions on the use of property. The court thus applied a two prong test to determine that the regulation was reasonably related to the property and water control plans, and the fee reasonably served its purpose.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of plaintiff home owner's association's request for a preliminary injunction barring defendant, governmental water and resource agencies, from collecting mitigation fees as a condition for construction permits. Plaintiff failed to show that it would suffer irreparable harm or was likely to succeed on the merits on its Takings Clause claim. The fees were reasonably related to the purpose for which they were used.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homosexual filed an action under the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 51 after defendant boy scouts council refused to accept him as a troop leader. The trial court entered judgment in favor of defendant, and plaintiff appealed. Defendant cross-appealed. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, but reversed the trial court's decision that defendant was a business establishment under the Unruh Civil Rights Act. The court held that because of defendant's expressed belief that homosexuality was immoral, compelling defendant to accept a homosexual as a troop leader constituted an unlawful interference by the state in defendant's expressive association rights under U.S. Const. amend. I. In analyzing intimate association rights, the trial court should have focused on the local troop, rather than the larger council. The court found that the Unruh Civil Rights Act did not apply to the local troop because it was not a business establishment. Assuming that the trial court properly focused on the larger unit, the court found that defendant was also not a business establishment because it did not have a business purpose or offer traditional public accommodation.</SPAN></P>

The court found that intervenor was a special district within the meaning of Cal. Const. art.

In addition, the court found that the tax in question was a special tax because it was levied to fund a specific government program; i.e., education and therefore, the tax was subject to Cal.

The court further held that Assembly Bill No. 2883 did not violate the separation of powers clause of Cal. Const., art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens sought to compel defendant city to provide plaintiffs with certain public agency financial records. After both the lower court and the court denied plaintiffs' petitions for writ of mandate, and the supreme court denied review, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the court, to which defendant responded by filing a motion to dismiss. The court granted defendant's motion and dismissed the appeal because Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 6259(c) limited review of orders pertaining to public records requests to a petition to the appellate court for issuance of an extraordinary writ, which the court had previously denied. The court rejected plaintiffs' contention that &sect; 6259(c) violated their constitutional rights because &quot;appellate jurisdiction,&quot; as provided in Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 11, did not confer a right to &quot;appeal.&quot; Similarly, it was not unconstitutional for the legislature to limit review to an extraordinary writ as it did pursuant to &sect; 6259(c). Therefore, plaintiffs exhausted their only avenue of review when the court previously denied their writ petition and the supreme court denied review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant building contractor associations filed a petition for writ of mandate against respondent Department of Industrial Relations that asserted constitutional challenges to respondent's decision to delete a particular wage determination. The trial court denied the petition, and the court affirmed on appeal. The court determined that appellants had a sufficient interest in the determination to give them standing to proceed. However, the court held that, absent a showing of failure to exercise discretion, respondent's decision to rely on the existence of a collective bargaining agreement as the basis for the wage determination did not establish an unconstitutional delegation of its legislative authority to private parties. The court ruled that respondent's action was not arbitrary and capricious, as no statute prevented respondent from determining that the information provided was insufficient to support a wage determination. The court determined that because respondent exercised delegated quasi-legislative power, there was no constitutional requirement to hold hearings or give notice before making its wage determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs retailers brought an action to prevent defendant city from imposing conditions on the rebuilding of destroyed or damaged businesses, and on the operation of existing businesses under threat of revoking their deemed approved status under a city ordinance governing conditional uses. The trial court denied plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction and sustained defendant's demurrer without leave to amend. The court affirmed the order of the trial court, as Cal. Const. art. XX, &sect; 22 and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 23000 et seq., did not preempt defendant from exercising its zoning and land use authority over businesses that were licensed to sell alcohol for off-site consumption. The ordinance did not regulate alcohol sales, but were instead designed to abate nuisances in the vicinity of these businesses. The court held that the new ordinance applied to plaintiffs' businesses because they were no longer &quot;grandfathered&quot; or &quot;deemed approved&quot; conditional uses, due to a break in continuous operation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A worker on an offshore oil drilling platform was discharged for refusing to submit to a urinalysis drug test. He was therefore denied unemployment benefits based on misconduct under Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code, &sect; 1256. In a declaratory judgment action by plaintiff labor organizations, the trial court concluded it was permissible for defendant board to deny unemployment benefits based on misconduct. On appeal, the court affirmed. Even though there was no cause to believe the employee was under the influence of illegal drugs on the job, he was employed in a hazardous work environment. The employer had a reasonable interest in having its employees submit to annual and periodic drug screens. The employee himself testified that his work environment was hazardous. Given the hazards to all employees working on the oil-drilling platform who could injure themselves, if impaired, and jeopardize the safety of others who might have to come to their rescue, the drug testing requirement was reasonable. Even though the employee's specific job might not be considered safety sensitive in another location, the hazardous environment in which he worked, by his own admission, made it so in this case.</SPAN></P>

The court held that restrictions, while allowed, in order not to unreasonably restrain the liberties which petitioners retained under both federal and state constitutions, were to be determined on a case by case basis.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which held that there was no unconstitutional taking that occurred in conjunction with respondent, the California Coastal Commission, denying appellant's application for a coastal development permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant submitted an application to respondent, California Coastal Commission, for a coastal development permit in order to build a home. The application was denied for a variety of reasons, including that the Commission could not be sure whether another agency, that apparently did not even exist, might conclude that appellant's house would have a significant adverse effect on the area. Appellant sought judicial review by filing a petition for a writ of administrative mandate and complaint for inverse condemnation. At the hearing, the trial court denied appellant's motion for summary adjudication and found there was no unconstitutional taking. On review, the court held that the takings issues raised by appellant's inverse condemnation action alleging a regulatory taking arising from the Coastal Commission's denial of his development permit were to be determined in a court trial. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed and the matter remanded with instructions to the Coastal Commission to process appellant's permit application consistent with the court's opinion, and for the trial court to take such further action as necessary to carry out the court's views.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers commenced a class action against defendants, the State Board of Equalization and the State of California, seeking a refund of unconstitutionally collected sales taxes that were to support the San Diego County Regional Justice Facility. The trial court ordered defendants to submit a plan to refund the taxes but, during the pendency of the litigation, the legislature enacted Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 7275 et seq., which, by its terms, constituted the sole manner of obtaining refunds. Defendants appealed and the court reversed the trial court's order, dismissing defendants' petition for mandate as moot. The court found that the trial court's judgment created no vested rights and that the legislature clearly intended the statutory scheme to apply to the pending litigation. The court further found that Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 32, gave the legislature plenary power to create the refund scheme through statute and that the statute was not unconstitutional, although it created different classes of taxpayers and although its ends might have been achieved through different means.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that the convictions were proper where California had not adopted an unrestricted domestic sewage exemption and the publicly owned treatment works was not a permitted facility for accepting hazardous waste through sewage lines. The court found that the laboratory results were admissible because the relevant statutes did not specifically provide that evidence should be excluded for failure to use a certified laboratory. The court found that defendants did not overcome the presumption that the court used the correct standard for intent. The court found sufficient evidence of all convictions. The court also found that defendants' vagueness challenge to their felony convictions was frivolous in light of the rule that one to whose conduct a statute clearly applied could not successfully challenge it for vagueness and that the relevant statutes and regulations were not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendants' conduct.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted respondent summary judgment on appellant's claim that respondent was required to withhold payment from the deceased's designee, notwithstanding &sect; 12479, because of the widow's interest in the payments as community property under Cal.

On appeal, appellant argued that &sect; 5250's later enacted and specific provisions governing the disposition of community property impliedly repealed the broad language of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff detainee's neck was fractured in an altercation with defendant police officer, who was either conducting a patdown search of plaintiff or attempting to handcuff him. Plaintiff brought an action for damages against defendants, city and police officer, alleging state and federal causes of action. The jury found by general verdict, and assessed damages, in favor of plaintiff. Defendants sought review of the decision. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the trial court committed error in instructing the jury that plaintiff had a right to use reasonable force to resist an unlawful detention, because no such right existed. The court found the error prejudicial, because it allowed the jury to overlook as irrelevant plaintiff's actions after the initial detention and whether they set in motion the chain of events which followed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, consolidated defendants, were a group of homeless individuals who had been prosecuted for violating the camping ordinance of Santa Ana Mun. Code, ch. 10, art. VIII, &sect; 10-400 et seq., which made it an offense to &quot;camp&quot; or &quot;store&quot; personal property in public in the City of Santa Ana. Petitioners sought a writ of mandate against enforcement of the ordinance and challenged its constitutionality. The court issued the writ of mandate, found the ordinance unconstitutional, and ordered the municipal court for respondent City of Santa Ana to sustain petitioner's demurrers to the violations of the ordinance. The court found that the ordinance punished the homeless specifically and as such was cruel and unusual punishment of an involuntary status. The court held that, if allowed to stand, the ordinance would turn the jail into a poorhouse and would thus destroy liberty. The court further found the ordinance was vague and overbroad and found that the definitions within the ordinance made no distinction between camping and picnicking or between camping paraphernalia and a student's backpack and that this offended the due process clauses of both the state and federal Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner's new counsel filed a preemptory challenge to the trial judge, which the trial judge found to be untimely and overruled. The court had ordered the trial judge to declare the mistrial after an extraordinary delay and efforts by the trial judge to save the case. Upon review, the court granted a preemptory writ of mandate in favor of petitioner, holding that disqualification of the trial judge was mandatory, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc.

Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 6125, 6126. The court ruled that the authority of attorneys in fact under &sect; 2494 was subject to California State Bar Act's prohibition against the practice of law by nonlawyers, and that none of the enumerated powers in section &sect; 2494 expressly allows attorneys in fact to practice law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, department of motor vehicles and its director, issued an accusation against respondent automobile dismantler, seeking to suspend his license. The accusation and a notice of hearing was sent to respondent at his established place of business by certified mail and it was signed for by a tenant at the address. Respondent did not appear at the hearing and the administrative law judge (ALJ) revoked his license. Respondent's request for reconsideration was granted based on his contention that he did not receive the notice. The ALJ's original decision was ultimately adopted by appellants. The trial court granted respondent's petition for writ of mandate and held that service was not effected and the hearing was therefore unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the service complied with Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 11505 and &sect; 8311 and satisfied due process of law because the notice procedures were reasonably certain to accomplish actual notice. The court held that appellants had discretion to grant relief to respondent for his failure to attend the hearing, but its refusal to provide a de novo hearing on the substantive issues was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the claim that the state would effect an unconstitutional taking of private property by protecting those species was not ripe for review because the state regulations would be applied to the private property in the future and the effect on the property was uncertain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff journalist appealed from the judgment on the pleadings and summary adjudication that was entered by the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) in favor of defendant utility in an action alleging, inter alia, libel, slander, and interference with employment contract, economic relationships, and ratepayers' rights, where plaintiff was fired after defendant's officers accused her of a conflict-of-interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to being hired by an energy trade publication, plaintiff journalist ended her membership with a group that opposed nuclear power. Later, officers of defendant utility contacted her employer and accused her of having a conflict-of-interest, alleging that a member of the activist group had said that plaintiff was still doing work for them. Consequently, plaintiff was fired. She similarly lost a free-lance position with another publication after an officer contacted it and accused her of bias. Plaintiff sued for libel, slander, and interference with contract, economic relationships, and ratepayers' rights, but judgment on the pleadings and summary adjudication was entered for defendant. Plaintiff appealed. In affirming in part, the court ruled that the ratepayers' rights claim was unsupported by the evidence. In reversing in part with respect to the libel, slander, and the other interference claims, the court ruled, inter alia, that blacklisting plaintiff served no legitimate purpose under U.S. Const. amend. I and Cal. Pub. Util. Code &sect; 453(a). Also, factual disputes existed as to certain defamatory comments, the issue of intentional conduct, and privilege to interfere.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed as to the interference with ratepayers' rights claim because the claim was unsupported by the evidence. The judgment was reversed in part with respect to the libel, slander, and the other interference claims because, inter alia, certain comments were not protected by the First Amendment and issues of fact existed regarding certain defamatory comments, the issue of intentional conduct, and privilege to interfere.</SPAN></P>

Because appellant's solicitations did not explain that there was a difference between a homestead exemption and a declared homestead, the court held that the solicitations were deceptive and misleading and they were not entitled to commercial speech protection. The court rejected appellant's arguments that the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to lawyers because its legislative history clearly indicated that its purpose was to prevent letters such as those that appellant had been sending to the public.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, county residents and others, appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Napa County (California), which declared that a local initiative confirming portions of the general plan relating to agricultural land, adopted by voters of defendant county, was valid, and dismissed a petition for writ of mandate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents of defendant county adopted an initiative that confirmed existing portions of the general plan relating to agricultural land, ensuring that those portions of the plan could not be changed without a vote of the people. Plaintiffs, county residents and others, sought a declaration that the initiative was invalid, and a writ of mandate ordering defendant's board of supervisors to cease enforcing the measure. The court affirmed a trial court judgment declaring the initiative to be valid and dismissing the petition for writ of mandate. The general plan affected a mixture of statewide and local concerns, and was amendable through the initiative power.  Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 65358 did not give defendant's board power to amend the general plan, but only provided procedures for exercising that power. Accordingly, the initiative did not interfere with any duty of defendant's board of supervisors to amend the general plan. The initiative did not intrude in matters preempted by state legislation, and did not frustrate land use planning in defendant.</SPAN></P>

The jury also found he committed the offenses because of the victim's race, color, religion, nationality, or country of origin in violation of Cal. Penal. Code &sect; 422.75 (b). The appeals court affirmed, holding that the trial court's jury instructions were not erroneous and evidence was not improperly admitted in the trial. The court held that the enhancement appellant received for the &quot;hate crime&quot; did not violate appellant's rights under U.S. Const. amend. I, and was not unconstitutional. The trial court did not err when it failed to sua sponte define terms in the jury instruction because the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, misleading, nor incorrect. There was no sua sponte duty to instruct on the meaning of terms in common usage, which are presumed to be within the understanding of persons of ordinary intelligence. The granting of prosecutor's motion to show co-defendant's tattoos to the jury did not violate the Confrontation Clause, U.S. Const. amend.

The trial court held that Proposition 13 required approval by a two-thirds majority of voters.

On appeal, the court agreed that the acts, as originally drafted, violated Proposition 13. However, as amended, they did not.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant California Department of Transportation denied the claim of plaintiff property owner for relocation assistance for renovating replacement property to make it suitable for plaintiff's use and the Relocation Appeals Board (Board) agreed. The trial court ruled that Cal. Code Regs. tit. 25, &sect; 6018 precluded award of renovation costs if a project was federally funded, and thus violated Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 7267.8, and 7260.5 and constituted an unconstitutional denial of equal protection. The trial court also ruled that Cal. Code Regs. tit. 21, &sect; 1407.05 was invalid because it did not permit the exercise of discretion. The trial court ordered the Board to reconsider plaintiff's appeal pursuant to the provisions of Cal.

On appeal, the court found that both &sect; 7267.8 and tit. 25, &sect; 6018 provided that, on federally assisted projects, federally allowed payments were the minimum to be paid. The court rejected the finding of unconstitutionality or conflict regarding tit. 25, &sect; 6018. The court affirmed the order that the Board consider plaintiff's request for benefits under tit. 25, &sect; 6090.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court, San Diego County, (California) for burglary that also ordered that he comply with restitution orders issued under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 13967(c) requiring that defendant pay damages to the victim. The amounts due under the restitution order were to be taken from defendant's prison wages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglarizing a home and was ordered to pay restitution by the trial court pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 13967. Defendant appealed the trial court judgment, contending that the restitution orders were invalid and unconstitutional. The court agreed with the state's argument that a former penal code section pertained to &sect; 13967(a), and not &sect; 13967(c) as relied upon by the trial court, and struck that part of the trial court judgment. Defendant primarily contended on appeal that one victim's loss, damage to a car transmission, was not caused by his crime, thus the restitution order for that was neither rehabilitative nor directly related to his crime. To impose restitution under &sect; 13967(c), the economic loss suffered by the victim had to be the result of a defendant's criminal conduct. The trial court found that the victim's attempt to flee the danger of the burglary caused the transmission problems; thus, the transmission damage was a &quot;result&quot; of the criminal conduct and so recoverable under &sect; 13967. The trial court judgment was affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court judgment convicting the defendant of burglarizing the victims and ordering restitution was affirmed by the court, as modified. The court found that the restitution orders were based upon the wrong statutory provisions, and corrected the orders so that they were supported by the proper statute allowing imposition of restitution on defendants for economic losses suffered by the victim as a result of the criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's conviction for making terrorist threats after he approached two minority pedestrians with a gun and threatened to kill them if they called the police because the statute proscribed only unconditional threats, and appellant's threat was conditioned on calling the police, and therefore did not violate the statute. The court affirmed appellant's sentence and various other convictions imposed from the incident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;The judgment is affirmed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for resentencing and correction of the abstract of judgment.  <BR></SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court, Orange County (California) which convicted him of second-degree murder. He argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress a photograph, obtained during an allegedly illegal &quot;gang sweep&quot; field interrogation, and subsequent identifications. Appellant also contended that the trial court erroneously imposed the aggravated term for gun use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Obtaining information for a &quot;gang book&quot; to use in future criminal investigations, police approached defendant and his companions and ordered them to &quot;stay there&quot; while they were patted down for weapons. Officers interviewed them one at a time and took individual photos. Defendant was later identified from his gang book photo as the shooter in a murder. Witnesses also identified defendant from his booking photos and made in-court identifications. Denying defendant's motion to suppress the gang book photo and subsequent identifications, the trial court convicted him of second-degree murder. On appeal, the court affirmed. The investigatory stop of defendant and his companions based on suspected gang membership violated U.S. Const. amend. IV, the court held, because mere membership in a gang was not a crime. The court concluded that the gang book photo was fruit of the poisonous tree and should have been suppressed, but found that the booking photos and in-court identifications had independent bases for admission as witness recollections. Finding that defendant's &quot;reracking&quot; of his pistol to correct a misfire was not an aggravating circumstance, the court remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although finding that the gang book photo should have been suppressed as the fruit of an unconstitutional detention, the court found sufficient admissible evidence to affirm defendant's conviction for second-degree murder. The court remanded for resentencing because the trial court improperly imposed an aggravated circumstance for defendant's gun use.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Municipal Court for the Los Angeles Judicial District of Los Angeles County (California), which convicted appellant of three counts of failure to file a state personal income tax return in violation of Cal. Rev. Tax. Code &sect; 19401(a), and sentenced appellant to jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted in the trial court of three counts of misdemeanor failure to file a state personal income tax return in violation of Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 19401(a), and sentenced to jail. The appellate court affirmed and certified the matter to the court in order to settle the question of whether willfulness was an element of &sect; 19401(a). The court held that because the collection of taxes served a high public purpose, tax statutes were therefor regulatory or public welfare in nature. Further, the fact that the sentence imposed by &sect; 19041(a) was punitive rather then regulatory did not change that conclusion, as the determination of whether a statute was a strict liability offense did not turn on the type of punishment contained in the statute. Finally, because a violation of &sect; 19041(a) constituted a public welfare offense, a finding of criminal intent was not required before someone could be convicted of that offense. Accordingly, the legislature created a strict liability offense by specifically providing in &sect; 19041(a) that a person who failed to file a tax return was guilty of a misdemeanor even if that person had no intent to evade the law. Judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of conviction affirmed where because the tax statute under which appellant was convicted was a strict liability statute, whether or not appellant willfully violated that statute was inconsequential to a conviction thereunder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of conspiracy to commit second-degree murder and other crimes, after the death of a young boy in a drive-by shooting. On cross-appeal the state contended that the trial court had improperly sentenced defendants to an indeterminate sentence of only 15 years to life for conspiracy to commit second-degree murder. The state asserted that under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 182 every conspiracy to commit murder was to be punished as a first-degree murder, with a sentence of 25 years to life. The court affirmed. The trier of fact was authorized to return a verdict finding conspiracy to commit murder in the second degree. Only if the trier of fact failed to determine the degree, was a conspiracy to commit murder punished as one to commit first-degree murder. Since the legislature had authorized a verdict of conspiracy to commit second-degree murder, it clearly did not believe that crime to be a logical impossibility. The crime of conspiracy to commit second-degree murder was punishable under &sect; 182 and Cal. Penal Code &sect;190 by a sentence of 15 years to life.</SPAN></P>

The City, however, was empowered to impose a real estate transfer tax, taking precedence over conflicting provisions of state law by virtue of the home rule powers conferred on charter cities by Cal.

Plaintiffs then filed suit against defendant and appellant seeking a writ of mandate and injunctions to stop logging at both sites. The trial court concluded that the THP's were invalid because defendant abused its discretion in approving them, and appellant sought the court's review. The court held that under Cal. Code Regs. tit. XIV, &sect;&sect; 898.1, 898.2, defendant could not approve any THP unless all feasible measures necessary to substantially lessen any potential significant environmental impacts had been included in the THP. Therefore, because there was no evidence submitted at trial that the mitigation measures were unfeasible, and because defendant did not follow the applicable law as contained in &sect;&sect; 898.1, 898.2, defendant's approval of the THP's constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

In addition, the transportation projects to be funded by the sales tax were for city or county purposes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced on a felony, but was released on bail pending appeal. Defendant failed to appear when his conviction was affirmed and remittitur issued. An information was filed alleging violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1320.5 because defendant was charged with a felony, had been released on bail, and had willfully failed to appear as required in order to prevent the imposition of sentence. The trial court granted defendant's demurrer, holding that the statute did not apply to bail pending appeal. Upon appeal by the state, the court reversed the trial court, holding that in the context of the bail statutes and the applicable case law it was the intention of the statute that whether it was pre-conviction or post-conviction, failure to appear while released on bail when charged with a felony was punishable as a separate offense. The court held that flight before sentencing was indistinguishable from flight to avoid the imposition of sentence because to find otherwise resulted in a harsher punishment for a defendant who fled before conviction and was presumed innocent than for a defendant who fled after conviction and had been found guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order of the trial court granting defendant's demurrer because defendant's failure to appear while released on bail for a felony offense was a new, chargeable offense, regardless of whether the bail was granted for pre-conviction or post-conviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of mandate preventing defendant from entering into the contract. The trial court denied the petition, but the court of appeal reversed and remanded. The program exceeded defendant's charter and was void. The charter specifically stated that projects had to be given to the lowest and best responsible bidder. The failure to submit documentation did not make plaintiff's bid nonresponsive. The examples provided by defendant were cases were the charter specifically required compliance with its provisions. Rejection for nondisclosure of compliance with the program was not in the charter.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought a writ of prohibition to vacate an order by respondent, Superior Court of Shasta County (California) denying his motion to dismiss after the municipal court denied him permission to file a motion to suppress evidence. Respondent held that it was not timely filed. Petitioner had been detained after real party in interest, the state, filed charges against him for possession of a controlled substance and related offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real party in interest, the state, filed charges against petitioner inmate for possession of a controlled substance and related charges of sale and transportation. At the preliminary hearing, petitioner orally stated that he intended to move to suppress alleged illegally obtained evidence. The municipal court denied the motion because respondent did not give proper notice under Shasta County Mun. Ct. R. 7.03(E) and Shasta County Mun. Ct. R. 10.03. Respondent superior court denied petitioner's motion to dismiss. Petitioner sought a writ of prohibition to vacate respondent's order. The court of appeal granted the writ holding that the local rules conflicted with Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5(f), which allowed motions to suppress to be raised at preliminary hearings. Supporting case law did not require notice based on a reading of legislative intent. Thus, the two rules were inconsistent with the statute and invalid. For policy reasons, to hold otherwise would force defendants to anticipate potentially inadmissible evidence, which would chill their right to bring motions to suppress at preliminary hearings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal granted petitioner inmate's request for a writ of prohibition which restrained respondent superior court from taking further action accept to dismiss the case. Real party in interest's, the state's, objection to the filing of a motion to suppress at a preliminary hearing should not have been granted. Local rules which required notice could not supercede statutory law which gave petitioner the right to file without notice.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found no constitutional violation in allocation of mental health funds pursuant to the Act. The court did find the department's allocation of state hospital beds unconstitutional and ordered reallocation, granted injunctive relief against defendants, and awarded plaintiffs damages. On appeal, the reviewing court found that an unequal distribution of state mental health resources resulted from historical choices by counties about participating in the Act's incentive matching program. Defendant's had a legitimate governmental purpose in maintaining a county's base allocation of state hospital beds while attempting to equitably reallocate resources over time.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff residents association and plaintiff property owners filed a nuisance complaint that sought an injunction to force defendant city to reduce the traffic speed and volume on a certain street. The trial court granted defendant's demurrer to the complaint because it found that routing of traffic was a legislative function and that, therefore, it did not have the power to grant the relief requested. The court affirmed the dismissal and held that plaintiffs did not state a cause of action because Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 3482 stated that nothing done under the express authority of a statute could be deemed a nuisance and because courts lacked the power to compel legislative bodies to perform legislative acts in a certain manner. The court noted that defendant's authority to maintain and manage the street was defined in several statutes. The court also affirmed the ruling that plaintiffs could not amend their complaint to claim other relief because the complaint did not, as alleged by plaintiffs, state facts sufficient to state causes of action for inverse condemnation, dangerous condition of public property, or inconsistency with defendant's general plan.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged a judgement from the Superior Court of Marin County (California) that denied its claim for partial refund from appellee tax collectors. Appellant claimed that the newly passed Cal. Const. art. XIII A, Proposition 13, with its lower tax base calculation for real property, meant that appellant was no longer required to pay tax based upon the higher tax base calculation contained in Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer was a county that owned real property in the neighboring counties of appellee tax collectors. Appellant had paid real property tax based upon the calculation provided in Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 11. After the passage of Cal. Const. art. XIII A, also known as Proposition 13, appellant sought a partial tax refund based upon a claim that the lower tax base calculation in Proposition 13 applied to its property. The court affirmed the judgment to deny the partial refund claim. The court held that Proposition 13 had not expressly repealed or in any way altered &sect; 11. The court relied upon principles of constitutional construction and determined first that Proposition 13 never remotely or explicitly mentioned &sect; 11, evidencing voter intent that Proposition 13 did not impliedly repeal &sect; 11. Next, the court noted that the legislature had considered this exact issue following the passage of Proposition 13, and yet concluded that government land was to continue to be taxed under &sect; 11. Finally, the court held that as a rule the provisions in &sect; 11 that specifically applied to government land controlled over the general real property tax provisions of Proposition 13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that denied appellant taxpayer's claim for partial refund of real property taxes paid to appellee tax collectors because the newly enacted Proposition 13 applied to residential homeowners as a form of taxpayer relief and not to local governments, like appellant, that owned real property in other counties and that were subject to the specific tax calculation for such local government real property owners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought a declaration that the statute making it a felony for a person previously convicted of a felony to possess a firearm, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021, subdiv. (a), was unconstitutional. He alleged that the section deprived him of due process of law under the United States and California Constitutions, deprived him of the right to bear arms, and that the regulation of possession of firearms by felons had been preempted by federal law. The court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer of respondents. Judgment was entered on the order sustaining the demurrer. On appeal, the court affirmed, because it found that the crime of a felon in possession of a firearm did not deny appellant due process or equal protection and the regulation of firearms by felons was within the historic police powers of the state and had not been preempted by federal law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for sexual assault. Defendant contended that his conviction should have been reversed because it was based on false evidence, but any false evidence admitted was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant challenged the validity of Cal. R. Crim. P. &sect; 868.5. He argued that allowing prosecution witnesses in cases involving assaults to be attended by two support persons was inherently prejudicial. The court rejected the proposition that such a procedure deprived defendant of a fair trial, but found that the practice had an effect on jury observation of demeanor. The court, however, determined that the effect of the accompanying witness was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant contended that the trial court's instruction on acting in concert misstated the law by implying that acting in concert was synonymous with aiding and abetting. The jury instructions did not equate the two. Defendant also challenged the trial court's sentencing enhancements. The court agreed with defendant that only a single enhancement could be applied to the one incident. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but modified his sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied appellant bank's peremptory writ of mandate to vacate its order that allowed respondent city to demolish appellant's residential buildings. The court reversed that denial on appeal and instructed the trial court to vacate its order and to hold further proceedings. The court found that respondent's acceptance of appellant's challenge of its decision to demolish the buildings and its holding a hearing on that challenge waived its claim that the challenge's timing and form were defective. The court also determined that appellant indirectly raised the issue of its right to repair by expressing its willingness to spend the estimated amount that was needed to correct the building code violations in its petition for a writ of mandate. The court further held that respondent had due process and statutory duties to afford appellant, even though it obtained the buildings subsequent to their being condemned, the choice of repairing or demolishing the buildings, a reasonable time to make that choice, and a reasonable opportunity to do so. The court also held that there were no exigent circumstances that required a more immediate demolition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded no contest to one count of petty theft with a prior conviction, and he entered the same plea to single counts of driving with a suspended license under Cal.

The court affirmed that judgment as modified. The court held that it was valid to require appellant to undergo narcotics testing, but that barring him from associating with any felons, ex-felons, or users or sellers of narcotics was unconstitutionally overbroad. The court modified that condition to prohibit appellant from associating with persons that he knew to fall in one of the above categories. The court held that the trial court's condition as to felons, ex-felons, and narcotics users and sellers had to be narrowly drawn because it impinged on appellant's right of freedom of association under U.S. Const. amend. I and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the modified terms of appellant's probation for his conviction for petty theft with a prior conviction. Requiring appellant to take narcotics tests was valid, but not allowing associations with felons, ex-felons, or users or sellers of narcotics impinged on his constitutional freedom of association and had to be narrowly drawn to bar appellant from associating with those that he knew had one of those attributes.</SPAN></P>

The court distinguished between rights which depended on whether there was a capital &quot;crime&quot; versus rights that depended on whether there was a capital &quot;case,&quot; looking to the purpose behind the rights. The court held that the core reason for denying bail to defendant was related directly to the gravity of his &quot;crime,&quot; and had no necessary relationship to the complexity of defendant's &quot;case&quot; or his potential punishment, whereas rights to extra investigators and experts, and similar rights, which defendant would have if he were still facing the possibility of the death penalty, would bear directly on his &quot;case&quot; and potential punishment.</SPAN></P>

The officer smelled marijuana and saw two snorting straws next to the powder, which turned out to be methamphetamine. The trial court denied the defendant's motion to suppress, and the court affirmed. Defendant argued that because &sect; 2805 only authorized inspections of vehicles and their parts, etc., the officer had no authority to enter the office area. The court held that it was reasonable for the police to attempt to inform the owner of their presence, and thus the officer had viewed the methamphetamine from a place where he was lawfully present. In response to defendant's argument that &sect; 2805 was unconstitutional because warrantless administrative inspections were permitted only of closely regulated businesses, the court pointed out numerous regulations relating to automobile repair to show that the automobile repair industry was closely regulated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, because, given the closely regulated nature of the automobile repair business, the warrantless search was constitutional as an administrative inspection, and the officer who observed the methamphetamine was legitimately in the office area seeking to notify the owner of the inspection.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution challenged an order of the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which sustained defendant's demurrer to the elder abuse charge against her on the grounds that the first clause of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 368(a) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and granted her Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995 motion regarding charges filed under the other two clauses of &sect; 368(a) on the grounds that she was not her father's caretaker.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had previously lived with her elderly, pensioner father and had been his caretaker. At the time of his death, defendant was no longer her father's caretaker. She was, however, a frequent visitor in his home and was present in the home at the time of his death. Following her father's death resulting from septic shock from bed sores, malnutrition, and neglect, defendant was charged with elder abuse under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 368(a). The trial court granted defendant's motion under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 995, holding that the charges under two clauses of &sect; 368(a) could not stand because defendant was not her father's caretaker. The trial court also sustained defendant's demurrer, finding that the first clause of &sect; 368(a) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court agreed that defendant could not be prosecuted under the &quot;caretaker&quot; portions of &sect; 368(a). However, the court ruled that the first clause of &sect; 368(a) did apply to defendant and was not unconstitutional, at least as applied to an adult child who owed her father a duty of care under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 270c.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment dismissing one elder abuse charge against defendant, because the elder abuse statute was constitutional as applied to defendant where, as an adult child, she owed her father at least the minimal duty of care required to avoid gross negligence. The court affirmed the judgment that defendant could not be prosecuted under the portions of the statute aimed at caretakers as defendant was not her father's caretaker.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As a resident of Oregon, appellant filed a petition in the trial court pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4852.01 et seq., for rehabilitation and pardon, which was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the three-year residency requirement of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4852.01(c) did not violate the equal protection clauses of either U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Cal. Const. art. V, &sect; 8. The court distinguished between residency requirements and durational residency requirements, and found that only the latter were violative of the right to travel because they affected migration from state to state. On the other hand, the residency requirement set forth in &sect; 4852.01(c) did not implicate a suspect classification or a fundamental right, and therefore was not subject to the strict scrutiny test that a durational residency requirement would be. The court determined that the residency requirement of &sect; 4852.01(c) furthered the state's substantial interest in assuring that the services it provided for its citizens pertaining to the non-fundamental right to pardon were enjoyed only by its residents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of appellant's petition for a certificate of rehabilitation and pardon, because appellant, who resided in Oregon, did not meet the three-year residency requirement contained in the pardon statute, and the residency requirement did not violate appellant's equal protection rights as it furthered the state's substantial interest in providing services for its residents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, paint manufacturers, contractors, and dealers, filed suit against several parties, including defendant technical review group, challenging amendments to environmental regulations.

The trial court sustained defendant's demurrers to several counts of plaintiffs' complaint and ultimately dismissed the complaint as to defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant had not engaged in state action when its members participated in the promotion and approval of the regulation amendments because its members merely acted in an advisory capacity to the districts, which was not in any way statutorily prohibited. The court found that the complaint failed to show that plaintiffs were deprived of notice and a hearing before the districts' subsequent adoption of the amendments. The court held that plaintiffs' remedy, if any, was against the districts because there was no unlawful delegation to or usurpation by defendant of the districts' powers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant adult foster child sought review of the summary judgment for respondent trustee in the suit appellant brought to claim a share of decedent's estate under Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 6408(e) in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California). The superior court ruled that appellant lacked standing because he had no rights of inheritance. Appellant claimed decedent would have adopted him but for the lack of his mother's consent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant adult foster child sought review of the summary judgment for respondent trustee in the suit appellant brought to share in decedent foster father's estate.  Cal. Prob. Code &sect; 6408(e) provided that a foster child in a continuous parent-child relationship could have shared in decedent's estate where the decedent would have adopted the foster child but for a legal impediment. Decedent was intestate, but his property had been transferred to a trust. Decedent specified a testamentary bequest to appellant, describing him as friend and godson. Appellant and his mother had lived with decedent for 12 years. There had been no marriage, and appellant's mother refused consent when decedent wanted to adopt him as a minor. Affirming the summary judgment against appellant, the court explained that if the decedent wished appellant to share in his estate, he could have adopted him during the 16 years when the mother's consent was not needed, or written a will providing more for him. The court added that once adoption became possible, the decedent should have been given a reasonable time to effectuate the adoption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment denying appellant adult foster child a share in the decedent's estate whose property was administered by respondent trustee. The court explained that appellant had not proved that decedent would have adopted him but for a legal impediment, as required by the statute, because the obstacle, the mother's consent, had not been required for the 16 years since appellant reached majority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought a writ of mandate to direct respondent Superior Court of San Diego County (California) to vacate its order holding that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422.75(b), which provided enhanced penalty for those choosing a victim because of race or other specified reasons and acting in concert, violated U.S. Const. amend. IV and XIV. Real parties in interest were charged under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 245(a)(1) and 243(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real parties in interest were charged with assault with a deadly weapon and by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 245(a)(1), and battery with serious bodily injury, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 243(d). The state appealed after the superior court ruled that the penalty enhancement provisions of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422.75(b) violated U.S. Const. amend. I and U.S. Const. amend XIV. Issuing a peremptory writ of mandate, the court held &sect; 422.75 was constitutional. The court explained that those who choose to employ conduct as a means of expression must make sure that the conduct they selected was not generally forbidden. Rejecting the argument that &sect; 422.75 had an unconstitutional chilling effect on freedom of expression, the court said the punishment was not only on the basis of beliefs, and, except when relevant to a criminal act, they could not have been offered in evidence. The court found no overbreadth problem because &sect; 422.75 only applied where the conduct was a felony and the state had proved a causal connection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the superior court to vacate its order that the enhancement statute for defendants acting in concert and choosing their victim on the basis of race, color, religion, nationality, country of origin, ancestry, disability, or sexual orientation was unconstitutional. The court held the statute did not have a chilling effect and was not overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant abortion clinic protestors caused disturbances that posed problems for patients trying to enter respondent abortion clinic's premises. Respondent brought an action seeking a permanent injunction against appellant's continued disruptive activities. Appellants sought review after the trial court issued the injunction and awarded attorney fees. On review, the court ruled that appellants' obstructing access to the clinic and engaging in acts of assault and harassment to prevent women who had expressed disinterest in appellants' views was not protected by the federal or state constitutions. The court held that the injunction was tailored narrowly to protect the patients' privacy interests, while at the same time providing appellants with ample opportunity to communicate their antiabortion message and was therefore appropriate. As to the attorney fees award, the court affirmed the award with exception to defaulting parties because respondent's complaint did not demand such attorney fees and Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 580 precluded an award against a defaulting party which exceeded the relief demanded in the complaint. The decision was affirmed and reversed accordingly.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 422.6 (1987), and that the offenses were enhanced pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422.7 (1987).</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 422.6 (1987) were enhanced pursuant to the &quot;hate crime&quot; statute,&nbsp;Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422.7 (1987). The court affirmed the judgments.  Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 422.6 and 422.7 required proof of a specific intent to deprive a person of a defined federal right, and were not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.  Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422.7 did not infringe U.S. Const. amend. I guarantees because it did not punish speech as such, but enhanced the penalty where the perpetrator selected the victim on the basis of race or other protected status.  Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422.6 fell within exceptions to U.S. Const. amend. I prohibitions on content-based regulations of speech delineated by the United States Supreme Court. The statute was aimed at conduct, not the suppression of ideas, and only proscribed speech that threatened violence where the speaker had the apparent ability to carry out the threat, and the victim reasonably feared for his or her safety.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed respondent's decision and remanded to the trial court directing it to issue a writ directing respondent to conduct a new hearing regarding the issue of a rental rate increase. The court held the ordinance did not deprive plaintiffs of their substantial and procedural due process rights.

The court found that the exclusionary rule did apply and applied to involuntary commitment proceedings due to the severe deprivations that someone involuntarily committed suffers. However, the court found that this violation was not reversible error because of the ample amount of other evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, water agencies and a landowner, sought relief from the denial of a petition for mandamus and declaratory relief by the Superior Court of San Joaquin County, No. 243391 (California), to declare unconstitutional&nbsp;Cal. Water Code &sect;13396.5 and to prevent enforcement of Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, &sect;2236, enacted by respondent State Water Resources Control Board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected respondent State Water Resources Board's contention that appellants, water agencies and a landowner, lacked standing to declare unconstitutional&nbsp;Cal. Water Code &sect;13396.5 and to prevent enforcement of its implementing regulation Cal. Code Regs., tit. 23, &sect;2236 because appellant water agencies were authorized by statutes to sue on behalf of their constituent water users. Appellants claimed that respondent violated both California and Federal equal protection because it construed &sect;13396.5 to require fees only from direct dischargers, or if respondent's interpretation of &sect;13396.5 was reasonable, &sect;13396.5 itself violated equal protection. The court held that respondent's interpretation of &sect;13396.5 was reasonable based on its legislative history and rules of statutory interpretation and that such interpretation did not violate equal protection because the distinction in &sect;13396.5 bore a rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate state purpose. The court held &sect;13396.5(e) did not violate Cal. Const. art. I, &sect;10 although it imposed imprisonment for failure to pay a fee, as this was a reasonable interpretation of &sect;13396.5(e) that avoided constitutional infirmity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's ruling that appellants water agencies and a landowner lacked standing but affirmed the judgment of the trial court that denied appellants' petition for mandamus and declaratory relief to declare unconstitutional a certain water discharge statute and prevent enforcement of its accompanying implementing regulation. Appellants were denied relief because the statutory scheme was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Appellants contended that the trial court erred in finding appellants' challenge time barred, that summary judgment was improper, and that appellees interfered with appellants right to receive the full fair market value of the property. Appellees cross-appealed, claiming the trial court improperly reduced the amount of attorney fees. The court affirmed, holding that there was no reason that the statute of limitation should have been declared inapplicable when appellants were on notice as to the existence of the ordinance prior to the purchase. Further, the court held that in light of the fact the statute of limitations barred all challenges to the ordinance, all of appellants' claims failed, and summary judgment was properly granted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Riverside County (California), which ordered it to refund school impact fees to respondent real estate developer that were erroneously paid at the residential rate instead of at the lower rate applicable to senior citizen housing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was the owner and developer of a residential real estate project situated within the jurisdictional boundaries of appellant school district. Occupancy of the project was limited to individuals 55 years of age and older. Respondent initially paid school impact fees at the residential rate instead of at the lower rate applicable to senior citizen housing. Approximately a year after making the last payment, respondent learned that senior citizen housing projects could be assessed school impact fees at the lower commercial or industrial rate. Respondent brought an action for a refund of the alleged overpayment. The trial court entered judgment for respondent. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, holding that the statute of limitations in Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 66020(d) barred the action and was the exclusive method for challenging the imposition of the fees, or for challenging an overpayment of the fees. Respondent's challenge thus failed where respondent did not timely file its protest, and failed to bring an action within 180 days of the imposition of fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent taxpayer held mineral leases from the federal government for which respondent paid royalties on the value of gross gas and oil production. The leaseholds were subject to county property tax. Respondent sought a reduction in assessed value, and a related tax refund, which appellant county refused. Respondent filed suit. The trial court held that the leaseholds were overvalued, and that respondent was due a refund. Appellant challenged, and the court reversed. The central issue was whether, under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 107.2, the leasehold value, for assessment purposes, was to be reduced by the present value of royalties that respondent was obliged to pay. The court reviewed Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 107.2, and concluded that even though the lessor government might not agree to reduce royalties to compensate for a higher effective tax rate, the royalties nonetheless were not being paid pursuant to &quot;authority,&quot; which prohibited royalty rate reductions. As respondent's leases did not satisfy the statutory condition for excluding royalties from the leasehold value assessment, the court reversed, and entered judgment for appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed. Appellant county did not have to refund certain property taxes paid by respondent taxpayer on leasehold interests granted by the federal government, because the leases did not qualify for assessment by means of a method that excluded, from the leasehold value, the present value of royalties paid to the federal government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant motorcyclists sought review of a ruling denying their motion to preliminarily enjoin respondents, Commissioner of the California Highway Patrol, Director of the Department of Motor Vehicles, Sheriff of Orange County, and Santa Ana Police Chief, from enforcing the Mandatory Motorcycle Helmet Law, Cal.

The court held that: the state had a legitimate interest in highway safety; there was no fundamental right to operate a motor vehicle, including a motorcycle; the law was legitimately enacted pursuant to state police power for the purpose of preventing injuries to motorcyclists and their passengers; the law was rationally related to that goal; the law was not impermissibly vague; and the law had not unlawfully discriminated against handicapped persons, or impermissibly infringed on appellants' rights to privacy, freedom of religion, or freedom of expression.
