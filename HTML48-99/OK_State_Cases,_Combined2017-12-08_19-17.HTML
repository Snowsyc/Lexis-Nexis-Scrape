Petitioner had also been convicted upon plea of Operating a Motor Vehicle While Under Suspension, arising from the same transaction, upon a plea of guilty and adjudged to pay a fine and costs of the case. Petitioner filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in the district court, which was denied. Thereafter, petitioner filed an original action in habeas corpus in the court. Granting the Writ of Habeas Corpus, the court held that the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense could not be extended beyond that term by reason of inability to pay fine and/or costs. The court also established guidelines of Oklahoma courts to follow when the judgment and sentence of a court imposed a fine and/or costs upon a defendant.</SPAN></P>

Another officer trained in administering a breathalyzer test testified that defendant's blood alcohol was above the legal limit. Various relatives and friends testified that defendant was sober the night he was arrested. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court committed fundamental error in instructing the jury that the breathalyzer test results were presumptive evidence of intoxication because such an instruction shifted the burden of proof from the State to defendant. The court disagreed, holding that the presumption created by Okla. Stat. Tit. 47, &sect; 756 was rebuttable, not conclusive. The presumption did not shift the burden to defendant to prove that he was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor when driving, nor did it change the ultimate burden of proof. The court noted that the presumption was relevant only to the issue of intoxication and was not a presumption that the accused was guilty of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, defendant argued on appeal that the Oklahoma Implied Consent Law, Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect;&sect; 751-760 (Supp. 1970), was unconstitutional and violated his right against self-incrimination under the United States and Oklahoma Constitutions. Defendant contended that the law compelled him to take a test for intoxication, thereby giving evidence against himself. The court noted that in Oklahoma, non-testimonial evidence such as a test of defendant's blood for intoxication fell within the scope of the self-incrimination prohibition. However, the court noted that there were no criminal consequences for failing to take a test and that the result of a refusal was a possible revocation for six months of the privilege to drive which was an administrative matter. The court therefore held that the law did not compel defendant to take the test. The court affirmed the judgment and sentence. The court held that when defendant took the test rather than face the penalty, defendant voluntarily and knowingly waived the self-incrimination privilege.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the officer was only directing defendant, who was in civilian clothes and was not restrained, to the courtroom. The court also held that the evidence of the subsequent offenses showed a common scheme and that holding a separate trial as to the passing of a second forged check within hours of the current offense's commission was proper because that offense and the current one were separate distinct crimes. The court further determined that the officer's testimony as to the circumstances of defendant's arrest was admissible because none of the statements as to which he testified could have been considered admissions due to defendant's denials of guilt and that defendant's utterance of &quot;no&quot; when asked if he dropped a check that was recovered was properly admitted as a res gestae.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the two sales were not a continuing transaction, and as such, constituted two distinct offenses. The court observed the differences in the time of the sales, the differences in the amounts of each sale, the differences in the number of items sold on each occasion, and the obvious completeness of each sale, which included the exchange of money and the passing possession of the drugs. There was no testimony introduced in the instant case concerning the second sale. The court held that Okla.

Further the court stated that defendant's sentence of death was not cruel and unusual punishment or was disproportionate to his crime, and that the standards the trier of fact may exercise was to vague, arbitrary, or invidiously discriminatory. The court upheld defendant's conviction and sentence and denied his appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the comments were prejudicial and highly improper. The court held that although the comments were made after defendant had already been found guilty, and although the comments were not objected to by defendant, the entire closing argument was so prejudicial that reversal was required. Because the trial court also erred in instructing the jury as to an indeterminate sentence, the court modified defendant's sentence to a shorter duration.</SPAN></P>

Defendant later brought the set to the witness's house and was paid $ 150 by check. He also sold sets to other railroad employees. The State's exhibits were the same type of television set that defendant sold. A month later, the witness turned the television into the police. Defendant asserted error because he was not afforded a preliminary hearing. He appeared with his first attorney and waived the hearing. A second attorney filed a motion to remand for a preliminary hearing but was denied. On appeal, the court held that defendant waived his right to a preliminary hearing and that the request was not timely filed. Because defendant did not submit jury instructions, the court refused to reverse an instruction that generally covered the subject matter.

On appeal, the court noted that, where an indigent defendant was incarcerated longer than the statutory maximum, his sentence was improper. However, in the instant case, the issue was premature. The court rejected defendant's other argument, i.e., that there was no valid statute under which he could be prosecuted as a former felon, and held that the validity of the habitual criminal statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 51 (1961), had repeatedly been upheld by the appellate courts. However, because it was unlikely that defendant would be able to pay the $ 1,000 fine at the conclusion of his imprisonment, his sentence was modified to eliminate the fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction, arguing that the trial court erred when it refused to permit his attorney to withdraw as counsel during the closing arguments, that compliance with Okla.

The court held that it would have been improper for the trial court to have permitted defense counsel to withdraw at the late stage. While defendant's compliance with &sect;&sect; 10-102 and 10-104 would have implicated defendant in driving a stolen automobile, defendant's criminal offense was proved by independent evidence.

The city ordinance invaded protected freedoms and punished conduct which in no way impinged upon the rights or interests of others. Loitering was in and of itself neither immoral or anti-social.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery with firearms and sentenced to 99 years in prison. On appeal, the sentence was reduced to 15 years. Defendant then was charged and convicted of use of a firearm in commission of a felony. Defendant appealed and the court reversed. The court held that it was apparent that using a firearm was an essential and necessary element in the offense of robbery with firearms, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect;801 (1961). To convict a defendant for robbery with firearms and then separately try him for using a firearm while committing the robbery (Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1287) was patently putting the defendant in jeopardy for the same offense in direct violation of constitutional prohibition. The court, therefore, held that it would be unconstitutional to prosecute under &sect; 1287, where the firearm or weapon use was an essential element or necessary factor in the commission of the primary felony. The court further noted that defendant had been denied the right to a speedy trial on the second charge.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further contended that the failure of the State to prosecute by indictment was a violation of U.S. Const. amend. V. The court determined that in Oklahoma, prosecution could be by information or grand jury indictment. Defendant also contended that his jury was not selected in strict compliance with Okla. Stat. tit. 38, &sect; 33 (1961) and that he was prejudiced as a result of this improper selection as evidenced by the fact that he received life imprisonment. The court found the life sentence imposed was the minimum allowed by law on a conviction for murder. Finally, defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient and the punishment excessive. The court would not interfere with the verdict even though there might be sharp conflict in the evidence where there was competent evidence from which the jury could have reasonably concluded that defendant was guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the arresting officer testified that he observed one defendant driving with his lights off and then enter the wrong lane of traffic. The officer pulled them over, noticed a television set, and detained them. He investigated the sales office from which defendants had emerged and noticed marks suggesting that equipment, including the television set, might have been removed, as well as pry marks on the door. He arrested defendants for burglary. One of defendants testified that the driver of the car stated that he wanted to pick up some stuff, they parked near the sales office, and the driver returned with the items. At trial, the court instructed the jury under Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 138, as to time for good behavior, and the jury recommended a sentence of seven years. On appeal, the court held that the statute, as an instruction, was highly prejudicial, and could have resulted in a higher grade of punishment to compensate for good time, and reduced their sentences to three and one-half years.</SPAN></P>

When police arrested defendant, she told them that she did not know the men's names and that one of them had handed her the money in the store. The defense presented no evidence. The court reduced defendant's punishment and otherwise affirmed the judgment. The trial court erred in instructing the jury on the good time credits provided by Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 138. Although the court had declared &sect; 138 to be unconstitutional, the jury could have considered the instruction by enhancing the punishment to overcome the good time credits, and justice was best served by modifying the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the jury was selected wholly from the ad valorem tax roles, amounting to economic discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment because people within defendant's economic status were systematically excluded. The court found that the question had already been aversely decided to defendant's contention and that the decision was based on sound reasoning. However, the court modified defendant's sentence from five to two years because defendant's former conviction was never properly proven. The court noted that a former conviction could not be the basis for charging defendant with a crime after a former conviction of a felony unless it was shown that defendant either was represented by counsel or validly waived one. The record was silent as to whether or not defendant was represented by counsel on the previous conviction, and therefore, the court held it could not be used as a basis for a former conviction to enhance punishment. The court was required to judge the case as a conviction for only the primary crime of rape in the second degree.

The court would not tamper with the jury's verdict where only a conflict of testimony existed. Defendant also contended that newly discovered evidence entitled him to a new trial. The court found that a motion for new trial upon the ground of newly discovered evidence was not sufficient where the newly discovered evidence only tended to discredit or impeach State's witnesses, and especially where it would not change the result of the trial. Defendant further complained of the trial court's instruction that recited Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect;138 (Supp. 1968).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's case was tried in a two stage proceeding. In the first stage the jury found defendant guilty of First Degree Rape. Then during the second stage, the trial court gave the instructions as to punishment, as prescribed by 57 Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 138 (1969). Defendant appealed citing this instruction as error, and contending that as a result of this instruction his rights were greatly prejudiced and as a result thereof, his punishment was enhanced. The court found that &sect; 138, requiring the giving of the instruction, was unconstitutional. However, giving of the instruction was not of such error as to justify reversal, but it was sufficient to justify modification. Under the erroneous instruction the jury was led to believe that defendant could serve 30 years in approximately 15, which was not necessarily true. Good time credits were entirely contingent upon strict compliance with the rules of the institution in which defendant was confined and they could be taken away at any time in the discretion of the warden. In any respect, good time credits could not be considered by the jury in assessing punishment.</SPAN></P>

The police officer searched the car and discovered another match box containing marihuana. Defendant was charged with illegal possession of marihuana.

Defendant sought review, challenging the constitutionality of the auto search and contending that the sentence was excessive.

The court held that where a misdemeanor was committed in the presence of a police officer, he had the right to arrest and search the immediate surroundings of the arrestee.

The error was did not require reversal, however, as there was no reasonable indication of prejudice resulting from defendant's waiver of a preliminary hearing without benefit of counsel.

Under the statute, the term &quot;child&quot; meant any male person under the age of 16 years and any female person under the age of 18 years. Defendants argued that the different age limits violated the equal protection provision of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in that it left the 17-year-old male youth subject to adult treatment for misconduct while at the same time a female of the same age was considered under the juvenile laws and the punishment specified by those laws until she reached 18 years of age.

The court ordered that the petitioner remain on bond until the trial court ruled upon the merits of his application for suspension of the judgment and sentence under &sect; 994. The court held that the judicial power to suspend a sentence even after appeal was totally separate from and independent of the executive power to commute, parole, or pardon. Allowing the suspension of judgment and sentence by the trial court after an appeal was constitutional, valid, and enforceable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction of violating a city ordinance by operating a motorcycle without a helmet, defendant appealed and challenged the ordinance as being unconstitutional. On appeal, defendant stipulated that he was guilty of riding a motorcycle while not wearing a helmet, that he was issued a traffic citation, and that an ordinance requiring motorcyclists to wear headgear did exist. However, defendant argued that the ordinance violated the due process and equal protection provisions of the United States Constitution and Okla. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 2 and 7. The court noted that the appeal posed the single issue of whether a legislative body, acting under its police power, could constitutionally require the wearing of protective headgear by persons riding motorcycles or motor scooters on the public streets and highways. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that it was within the State's police power to regulate and control the manner in which its citizens traveled on the public streets and highways in the interest of the public safety and welfare and that the ordinance was therefore constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction, claiming that the trial court improperly convicted him.

The court stated that the evidence affirmatively disclosed that the courtroom identifications of defendant were made as a result of observations by the witnesses on the night of the robbery rather than on the basis of the photographs shown to them at a later date and therefore the identification was proper.

The court admitted the contract produced for the grand jury, as well as testimony of grand jurors and the county attorney regarding defendant's grand jury testimony. Defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court reversed. Once it became clear that defendant was a target of the grand jury's investigation, defendant should have been fully advised of his constitutional rights against self-incrimination. Because he was not so advised, his incriminating testimony and disclosures were not voluntarily given, and were therefore inadmissible at his perjury trial.

Further, the language of &sect; 22.22a was sufficiently certain to appraise defendant of what conduct was considered criminally punishable and the necessary conditions under which such conduct was lawful. Also, defendant's offer of a bond to the agent indicated that he was aware of the statutory requirements prerequisite to engaging in the business of a messenger to obtain license plates for automobile owners.

The court held that the comments cited by defendants did not constitute reversible error and did not prejudice the jury, especially in view of the considerable weight of evidence indicating the defendants' guilt. However, the court found that the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 138 (Supp. 1969), making it mandatory for the courts to instruct the jury as to its provisions, and providing that the provisions of the section could be commented upon in the argument of any such trial were an unconstitutional encroachment by the legislature upon the judicial powers of the State. Therefore, since defendants were tried in a two stage proceeding, with the second stage concerning the punishment to be imposed, which included a supplemental instruction on &sect; 138, the court found prejudicial error requiring modification of the sentences. Accordingly, the ends of justice were best served by reducing the judgment and sentence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that instructions could not invade the province of the jury and should not extend beyond a clear statement of law applicable to the case. The court was of the opinion that the trial court committed error, notwithstanding the express provisions of &sect; 138, and that such an instruction should not be given. The court was further of the opinion that because the instruction arose during the second stage of the two-stage trial after defendant had been found guilty, the error did not require reversal.

Defendants alleged that the jury was illegally selected and they sought a writ of prohibition. The court denied the writ. The court held that Okla.

The record showed that the list of jurors comprised only of taxpayers that qualified for the homestead exemption. The court concluded that the jury list was contrary to the statutory intent. However, at the same time, defendants did not show how they were prejudiced by the procedure used to draw up the list of prospective jurors or how trial by a jury drawn from the list would deny them the right to a trial by an impartial jury. The court noted that the fact that taxpayers, other than those with homestead exemptions, were not included on the jury list did not show prejudice.

Defendant maintained that he was not tried by a jury of his peers because no Negro served on his jury and only one Negro was included in the panel from which the jury was selected. The court agreed with the State that the argument failed because it lacked proof that a scheme of discrimination existed whereby Negroes were systematically excluded from jury duty. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to admit the records relating to his mental condition.

On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. The court rejected defendant's argument that the corpus delicti could not have been established by the confession of the accused alone. The court ruled that it was not error to admit the testimony of two officers because the proof of the corpus delicti and the guilty agency was shown at the same time; under these circumstances, the order of proof lay within the discretion of the trial court. The record in the case clearly showed that defendant had reason to believe he was buying stolen property, even without the admission of his statement to the officers. The court held that the retroactivity or non-retroactivity of a rule was not automatically determined by the provision of the constitution on which the dictate was based.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Canadian County (Oklahoma), in which he was convicted of the crime of rape in the second degree. A change of venue was granted and the jury was not permitted to read, watch, or listen to reports about the trial. On appeal, defendant contended that he was denied a proper preliminary hearing when the examining magistrate refused to call and examine the witnesses that he had subpoenaed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Along with his co-defendants, defendant was charged in Oklahoma County, which was the county in which the alleged rape was committed upon a 15 year old girl. Following a change of venue, defendant did not attempt to call any of the witnesses at trial; he would, however, urge on appeal that their testimony was vital to his defense at the preliminary hearing. On appeal, the court found that the failure of the magistrate to hear the witnesses' testimony was in no way prejudicial to defendant. Where evidence presented at a preliminary hearing before a magistrate was sufficient to establish that a crime had been committed and that there was probable cause to believe defendant was guilty, the failure of the magistrate to allow defendant to offer immaterial testimony was not reversible error. The court held that defendant received a fair and impartial trial after the change of venue. The jurors were extensively examined by defense counsel, and they all stated that they would base their verdict on the evidence and would lay aside any opinion they might have formed as a result of what they had heard or read. Furthermore, none of the jurors were challenged by defendant for cause.</SPAN></P>

XIV and Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7. Furthermore, the court found that the State had offered no rebuttal testimony to evidence presented by defendant that he had no knowledge that the property was stolen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted for the crime of grand larceny. She challenged her conviction, asserting three assignments of error. First, she argued her trial was not presided over by any duly elected and qualified judge. Second, she argued that because a witnesses was required to swear in on a new testament, a religious test was injected into the trial. Third, she argued that the evidence used to convict her was obtained by an unconstitutional search of her person. The court found the position of supernumerary judge, the type of judge that presided over defendant's trial, was properly authorized and created under Oklahoma statutory law. Also, neither defendant nor the witness objected at trial to the use of the new testament. Moreover, any potential error was not reversible error because the witness belonged to the Methodist Church, an institution that believed in the new testament, and the witness likely felt conscience-bound by the oath, as provided under Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 401. Finally, the search of defendant was incident to a lawful arrest and defendant was lawfully arrested, without an arrest warrant, under Okla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The 15-year-old petitioner appeared before the trial court with his natural parents on a charge of delinquency and was appointed counsel.

The next day, the trial court granted the State's application for petitioner's commitment to a State hospital for observation for up to 90 days. Within days of petitioner's return from the hospital and a brief escape, a hearing was delayed by a demurrer, which was sustained in part. The State was granted leave to amend its pleadings. Petitioner entered a plea of not guilty to the amended pleadings, waived a jury trial, and agreed to trial. Thus, within two months of his return from the hospital, petitioner was adjudged delinquent and certified for trial as an adult. On appeal, the court held that petitioner's commitment for observation complied with Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1171 and proper certification procedures.

The Oklahoma habitual criminal statute was not unconstitutional as denying equal protection of the laws, as compelling an accused to be a witness against himself, or as providing for cruel or unusual punishment. The Oklahoma habitual criminal statute applied equally and impartially to all persons charged under it, and the fact that indictments or informations did not always charge a violation of such statute where the accused had prior felony convictions, did not invalidate it as denying equal protection of the laws. The Oklahoma habitual criminal statute did not define or describe a new and additional offense, but merely provided conditions under which one convicted of a crime could have been given a heavier penalty.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 47, &sect; 11-902(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In his trial without a jury on the charge of being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, defendant stipulated that he was intoxicated and that he was in an automobile in such a condition when the police apprehended him. The trial court found him guilty, sentenced him to pay a fine and to serve 10 days in the county jail, and overruled his motion for a new trial. On his appeal, defendant contended that &sect; 11-902(a) violated Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect;&sect; 2, 7 and U.S. Const. amend. 5, 14, in that the statute was so vague that it deprived him of due process of law, and was confiscatory in that it took away his driver's license. On review, the court declared that &sect; 11-902(a) was not unconstitutional, and that it defined two separate offenses: driving under the influence of alcohol and being in actual physical control while under the influence of alcohol. Moreover, the mandatory suspension of defendant's driver's license was not part of his sentence but was an administrative action, relief for which had to be obtained through civil means. Thus, because defendant had stipulated to the facts supporting his conviction, the court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

At trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence, arguing the evidence was obtained in violation of the constitutional protections against unlawful search and seizure; and, that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The trial court overruled defendant's motion to suppress. Defendant was found guilty. On appeal, the court affirmed. The ordinance of the City of Tulsa was not unconstitutional. These city ordinances were drawn under the police power of the sovereignty, which police power inured to the municipal government when the city was formed, under state authority. Further, if it was within the police power of the city to provide an ordinance, then it was within the power to provide the officer authority to inspect the hotel register. It was clearly established that a hotel was private property, devoted to public use. When an owner devoted private property to the public use he so devoted it bound with notice that it would be subject to public regulation. The police power granted to the City of Tulsa by its charter gave it the right to pass the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of forgery. Timely notice to appeal was filed, but the public defender filed to perfect the appeal within the time prescribed by law. Defendant's habeas corpus petition was denied. Thereafter, pursuant to the newly-enacted provisions of S. 152 (Okla. 1965), the court directed the trial court to appoint appellate counsel to represent defendant in perfecting an appeal. On appeal, defendant argued that S. 152 (Okla. 1965) was an unconstitutional ex post facto law for the reason that it authorized a judicial review of a criminal conviction after the time allowed for perfecting the appeal had expired when defendant was denied any of his constitutional rights relating to an appeal. The court held that S. 152 (Okla. 1965), which was enacted for the specific purpose of guaranteeing judicial review to indigent persons, was constitutional. Although the jury was improperly instructed regarding reasonable doubt, no objection was made and there was no fundamental error. The sentence, which was within the appropriate range, was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners contended that Okla. Stat.

The statute prohibited instigating fights between animals. The court held that the statute was not explicit or certain, and that persons of ordinary intelligence would have difficulty understanding what it attempted to prohibit. The court was unable to find from the words, context, subject matter, spirit or purpose of the act a clear indication of an intent on the part of the legislature to include a gamecock in the category of animals, or to make it a crime for a person or persons to conduct a cockfight wherein such gamecocks were subjected to needless suffering. The statute was not passed with the intention of prohibiting such sports as cock fighting. The statute was invalid because it did not apprise a man of ordinary intelligence of what crime subjects him to penalty, and was not subject to judicial interpretation without undue speculation.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 800 (1961). Based on a prior conviction of second-degree burglary, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1435 (1961), he was sentenced as a habitual criminal. In seeking habeas relief, the inmate alleged that he was being unlawfully restrained of his liberty on a judgment and sentence of 13 years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate had ignored his counsel and tried to appeal pro se from his judgment and sentence. He made default in such matter until the time allowed for appeal had expired. In his petition seeking relief, the inmate claimed that he was tricked out of an appeal. He also argued that the information in the original case was duplicitous because two separate and distinct offenses not based on the same transaction were charged. The court declined to grant habeas relief. It appeared that the trial court had jurisdiction over the inmate and the subject matter, and also had authority to pronounce the judgment and the sentence rendered, by virtue of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 800, and Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 51. The inmate was neither deprived of equal protection by the application of the habitual criminal statute, nor was he denied due process. While due process was available to him, he did not proceed in a manner to avail himself thereof. Essentially, the inmate sought to accomplish what he should have sought on appeal; however, he failed to file a timely appeal. The court noted that habeas corpus was not a substitute for appeal.</SPAN></P>

In affirming defendant's conviction the court held that the arrest was valid under Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 196.4 (1961). The court held that it mattered not that the officer arrested defendant for a traffic offense, because the officer could have arrested him based on probable cause to believe that defendant had committed a felony. The court noted that the officer's belief was evidenced by his call for backup. It followed that the search of the vehicle was incident to a lawful arrest, and defendant's motion to suppress the weapon properly overruled. The court summarily held that Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his previous conviction was in a municipal criminal court and thus could not be the basis of a second offense. The court noted that in the absence of a showing in the record that the conviction was a police court conviction on a city ordinance violation, it would not presume this fact, and held that because the judgment in the previous case had become final, it was sufficient in law to support the second offense charge. Defendant argued that &sect; 93, for which the municipal court had jurisdiction to prosecute defendant under Okla. Stat. tit. 11, &sect;&sect; 781-782 (1951), was unconstitutional. The court held that the constitutionality of habitual offender acts had been consistently upheld, and that in light of the legislature's power to define crimes and fix degrees of punishment, the statute was not unconstitutional in that it changed the crime from a misdemeanor to a felony. It also held that recent case precedent holding that in second and subsequent drunken driving cases a prior conviction should be considered only at a penalty stage of trial was not retroactive in effect and this procedure was not required at defendant's trial.

Defendant appealed contending that his statute of conviction was void. The law that prohibited mere possession of intoxicating liquor for one's own personal use, irrespective of the quantity which was possessed, had been repealed. However, Okla. Const. art. 27, &sect; 3 provided that the legislature was to enact laws providing for the strict regulation, control, licensing, and taxation of the manufacture, sale, distribution, possession, and transportation of alcoholic beverage. Also, Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 568 provided that it was unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to have in their possession any alcoholic beverages with the intent to sell the same without having first procured a license therefor from the Oklahoma Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. The court held the unlawful intent to sell coupled with the act of possession of a quantity of intoxicating liquor for which defendant had not first procured a license was a violation of the penal code, thus Okla.

He contended that the pardon made him a new man in the eyes of the law and prevented his prosecution as a second and subsequent offender on the conviction. In denying the petition for writ of habeas corpus sought by petitioner, the court held that while there were decisions to the contrary, and there has been said to be a clear conflict of authority on the point, according to the weight of authority the fact that petitioner was pardoned for his prior offense did not exempt him from the increased punishment on a subsequent conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that his confinement was illegal and unlawful by reason of the fact that he was a juvenile of the age of 16 years and had not been certified by the county children's court to be tried as an adult. He further argued that in the absence of certification by the children's court, the criminal courts were without authority to entertain jurisdiction over him and that the order committing him to the custody of the sheriff in lieu of posting bond pending preliminary hearing was void. After consideration, the court rejected the inmate's request for relief. The court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect;&sect; 862, 863, 864, and 866 were unconstitutional as to those portions which provided for treatment concerning male persons over the age of 16 years, and under the age of 18 years. The court further held that Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 861 was valid. The court concluded that certification of the inmate as an adult by the children's court was not required and that, therefore, his confinement was not illegal or unlawful by reason of the lack of such certification.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma) that convicted him of possession of firearms after a former felony conviction, arguing that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence and erred in receiving the verdict in the form returned and failing to require the jury to retire for further deliberation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of violating Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1283 (1961), which deemed it unlawful for a person previously convicted of a felony to carry on his person or in his vehicle a pistol. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence obtained by police in an illegal search. His motion was denied, and the matter proceeded to trial. The jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty and recommending a suspended sentence. Because defendant had a criminal record, he was ineligible to receive a suspended sentence; the district court rendered its judgment of conviction and sentenced defendant to a one-year term of incarceration. Defendant appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that, where defendant was lawfully arrested, the search of his vehicle was a search incident to a lawful arrest; the search was therefore proper, and defendant's suppression motion was properly denied. Further, the jury's sentencing recommendation was mere surplusage and was not a part of the verdict. It was in the sound discretion of the trial judge as to whether he would follow the jury's recommendation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, County Attorney of Comanche County (Oklahoma), filed an application for a writ of prohibition seeking to prohibit respondent, Judge of the Fifth Judicial District Court (Oklahoma), from enforcing an order restraining the County Attorney from taking the testimony of witnesses in a defendant's criminal prosecution without affording defendant the right to be present at the taking of testimony and to cross-examine such witnesses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's application for the restraining order contended that the County Attorney had violated the provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 258 in applying for and receiving subpoenas for the witnesses. The court granted the writ, holding that the district court did not have jurisdiction to issue the restraining order and that prohibition was the proper remedy. A court of equity had no jurisdiction over the prosecution and punishment of crimes and ordinarily would not restrain or relieve against proceedings of that kind, unless three elements existed: (1) that the statute to be avoided was attacked and proved to be unconstitutional or invalid and that enforcement of the statute would (2) destroy property rights and (3) inflict irreparable injury. Defendant's application for the restraining order made no attack on the constitutionality of &sect; 258 or its validity. No property right of defendant was involved. Rather, he sought to protect a personal right by the restraining order. Thus, defendant had not properly invoked the equity jurisdiction of the district court and the restraining order issued by the district court was in excess of its jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court next held that Okla.

Const. art. IV, &sect; 1. The court held that continuances were strictly a matter of judicial concern and not a subject of legislative power.

The court found that it did not appear that the bondsman had raised the constitutionality of the ordinance before the trial court or did it appear that he was charged with more than one violation of the ordinance. The court observed that it could not assume that the trial court would incorrectly rule on the matter if properly presented to it. The court fond that the bondsman had an adequate remedy at law, and if the trial court incorrectly ruled on questions of law or admissibility of evidence, a timely appeal may be reviewed by the court.

The trial court convicted defendant. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. Defendant was entitled to have an instruction clearly defining the law as to whom, at the time of the shooting, was the aggressor. It went to the very heart of the matter, for if the jury, under proper instructions, found that defendant withdrew from the scene of the original assault or disturbance of the peace and was thereafter pursued in a spirit of vengeance by the victim, who renewed the difficulty, defendant's right of self-defense was available to him. It was defendant's fundamental right to have the jury properly instructed on the material issue, which omission could have prejudiced defendant in a fair consideration of his lawful rights. It was reversible error for the trial court not to have so instructed the jury.</SPAN></P>

The court also determined that at the time that Oklahoma became a state, the common law was adopted by the state legislature. Further, the court stated that the year-and-a-day rule was applicable to defendant's charge, and therefore because the victim died more than a year and a day from the accident, defendant could not be charged with murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner juvenile sought a writ of mandamus requiring and compelling respondent judge to transcript the juvenile to the juvenile court for a determination of whether or not that court should retain jurisdiction or certify the juvenile as a child capable of knowing, and to be held accountable for, his acts, for proper criminal proceedings to any court which would have trial jurisdiction of such offense if committed by an adult.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was over 16 but under 18 and was charged with murder and kidnapping. The judge refused to transcript the cases to the juvenile court for a hearing of accountability on the basis that Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect;&sect; 771-776 were unconstitutional. The juvenile filed a writ of mandamus to compel the judge, as the committing magistrate, to transcript the case to the juvenile court. Noting that it was not necessary to decide the issue of the judge's authority, on his own initiative, to declare statutory provisions unconstitutional, the court denied the writ. The court followed the holding of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in a case decided after the petition had been filed which declared that &sect; 771 was constitutionally valid while &sect;&sect; 772 to 774, inclusive, were unconstitutional as to those portions which provided for treatment concerning male persons over the age of 16 and under the age of 18. The court found that because the constitutionality of the statute had received the attention of the state supreme court, and because that court's construction was in pursuant of jurisdiction conferred by the state constitution, it would adopt the state supreme court's interpretation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was treating patients without first having obtained and received from the Board of Governors of the Registered Dentists of Oklahoma, a license to practice dentistry.

Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 271 (1951), which was the statute he was convicted under, was unconstitutional. The court ruled that &sect; 271 was not violative of any provision of the Oklahoma Constitution. The court found that &sect; 271 had not included in its prohibitory language a ban against dental technicians. The court further found that defendant had not acted as a mere technician, but had touched the patients in order to make dental impressions. The court also rejected defendant's argument that the trial court did not have the authority to suspend part of the sentence and that either all or none of the sentence should have been suspended. The court concluded that the judgment was not void, but decided that defendant should only have been sentenced to a fine and not jail time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A witness was employed by an attorney for the state dentistry board for the purpose of contacting defendant with regard to procuring from him a lower partial plate. The private attorney, who was not an officer of any kind, furnished the money to pay for the partial plate. The court rejected defendant's claim that he was entrapped. The attorney employed by the board induced the witness to afford defendant the opportunity to violate &sect; 271. The witness did not have to use persuasion or inducements to obtain an appointment for the examination of his mouth and gums and the making of impressions for the partial plate. Defendant had an office with dental chair that was separate from his laboratory. Defendant performed the service for the witness, and it was apparent that defendant was prepared to perform like services for any customer who appeared. Thus, the intent to violate &sect;271 originated in the mind of defendant. The court held that &sect; 271 did not violate the Oklahoma Constitution because a state could enact legislation for the protection of citizens without violation of constitutional rights and no sound reason was advanced as to why the statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, petitioner, who was less than 13 years old, had been adjudged delinquent in a juvenile proceeding during which he contended he was denied due process of law on the issue of his mental capacity. Petitioner sought habeas corpus relief and bail and the court denied the request for bail, finding that, in capital offense cases, the burden of proof was upon him to establish his eligibility for bail. The failure of petitioner to testify in his own behalf at the hearing conducted on the matter to present the nature of his defense precluded a finding in his favor. The court granted the habeas corpus relief by dismissing the information pending in the district court, ordering the delinquency proceedings vacated and set aside, and ordering petitioner confined to a state hospital for the insane for observation and examination for a period not to exceed 90 days to determine his mental capacity to stand trial.

The statute did not conflict in any way with any of the constitutional guaranties possessed by one who is accused of committing a criminal offense. The court rejected defendant's claim that his prior conviction constituted a &quot;subsequent offense&quot; under the 1955 amendment to &sect; 93. There was nothing new about the 1955 amendment as the law existed prior thereto, except the punishment. Defendant was being prosecuted for an offense after the 1955 amendment was adopted, although the charge became a felony for the reason that prior to the felony charge defendant had been convicted in 1953 on a charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

The court affirmed the judgment, as the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. Five other persons whom had come to the home around the time of the offense, and were robbed by defendant before he escaped therefrom, positively identified him. Nor was denial of his motion error, as he failed to overcome the presumption of a fair and impartial trial. He submitted 32 affidavits in support thereof from citizens in the county, but they were general in nature and lacked specific facts showing the prejudice alleged. The State offered counter-affidavits. Also, the State's witnesses opined that defendant would get a fair trial in the county.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Garfield County (Oklahoma), which convicted him of the crime of passing a false and bogus check under Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The record developed that defendant issued a check in favor of a motor company and received therefor a certain automobile. The motor company had to return the money to the bank after the account holder denied ever having signed the check or ever authorizing anyone to draw the check and sign his name. When defendant was arrested several days later, the car had been in a wreck. Defendant had previously been convicted four times of embezzlement of automobiles. On appeal, defendant argued that the county attorney erred in listing in the information more than one previous conviction to support the prosecution under the habitual criminal statute. The court found no fundamental error. The fact that more than one previous conviction was alleged in the information filed under provisions of Okla. Stat. tit. 21 &sect; 51(1) (1951) did not render it subject to demurrer or require the trial court to strike from said information all allegations of more than one prior conviction. The court noted that the statute was not unconstitutional as denying equal protection of the laws, as compelling an accused to be a witness against himself, or as providing for cruel or unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held, inter alia, that: (1) Section 1029(b) was not unconstitutional and void even though it was not within the title to the act codified at Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 1028-1031 as originally adopted because re-enactment of the act cured any constitutional defect that might have existed; (2) the term &quot;lewdness&quot; as used in the statute included the making of an appointment to engage in prostitution or lewdness, and defendant could be found guilty even though the woman called the police instead of keeping the appointment; (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting certain questions to be asked of defendant on cross-examination; and (4) there was no reversible error in jury instructions. However, noting that it was defendant's first conviction and the penalty assessed by the court was the maximum allowable, the court modified defendant's punishment from 12 months to six months in the county jail.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held, inter alia that the information was sufficient in that it stated the charge with enough certainty to enable defendant to prepare a defense; that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict; that photographs of the scene of the accident were properly admitted; and that the traffic regulation statute defendant allegedly violated was not unconstitutional because of an alleged defect in its title or because of ambiguity. However, the court reversed the judgment and remanded for a new trial, concluding that the trial court committed reversible error when, after defendant was asked on cross-examination if he had been convicted of a sex offense in California, it failed to admonish the jury to ignore the question, and there had been no proof offered in support of the supposed conviction. The trial court also committed reversible error in failing to give an instruction relating to defendant's asserted defense of accidental homicide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and found guilty of forgery in the second degree. Defendant appealed his conviction, claiming that he was improperly convicted. The court held that neither the constitutional nor statutory provisions required that to be eligible to sit as a juror a citizen must be a taxpayer and that there was no impropriety if a taxpayer's name did not appear on the tax rolls and therefore on the jury rolls. The court also determined that even though defendant made the forged check in another state, it was not an essential element of the offense and by passing the forged checks in the state, the trial court had jurisdiction to try defendant for forgery. Further, the court stated that the State successfully produced the corpus delicti and defendant's right to present evidence in his defense was not violated by the trial court refusing to order out of state witnesses to obey a summons. In addition, defendant's claim of repaying was not a valid defense to forgery. Finally, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for the jury to determine defendant's insanity. The court upheld defendant's conviction and denied the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the prisoner was specifically advised by the recitals of the information that he was being tried in Denver for a crime alleged to have been committed in LaPlata County. The court determined that if the prisoner did not want to waive his constitutional right, he was in duty bound to protest when he knew that right was being violated. Having entered his plea and gone to trial, and reserved his protest until the People rested, the court concluded that the prisoner was too late.

Subsequently, a jury found defendant guilty of having wrongfully operated a motor vehicle on a public highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Defendant asserted several errors on appeal, but the court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that it was proper to deny defendant's motion to suppress certain evidence because the officers had every right to stop him and make an inquiry as to the reason for his violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 121.4 (1951), which prohibited driving to the left of the center of the highway. Furthermore, the court found that it was not error to deny defendant permission to argue to the jury the proposition that in the event of a conviction his driver's license would be automatically suspended for one year because revocation was a matter vested in the Commissioner of Public Safety and it did not affect the authority of the district court to impose the sentence.</SPAN></P>

The patient contended that &sect; 60 was unconstitutional because it failed to provide notice and an opportunity for a hearing. He also contended that his confinement was a deprivation of his liberty under Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 7. In vacating the order of commitment, the court determined that the patient was entitled to notice and a hearing under &sect; 7. The court determined that Okla. Stat. tit. 43A, &sect; 60 (Supp. 1953) implied that a patient was required to receive notice and an opportunity for a hearing. Therefore, it was constitutional. The court determined that &sect; 60 was unconstitutionally applied in the patient's case. He was not given notice and an opportunity for a hearing before the order of commitment was issued. At least 24 hours notice was required before the order was entered. Moreover, the patient should have been served with a written copy of the motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with obtaining property by trick or deception, by false or fraudulent representations and statements, and by the use of false and bogus instruments under Okla.

Const. art. II, &sect; 20, and U.S. Const. amends. V and VI. The court held that every presumption must be in favor of the constitutionality of an act passed by the Legislature, and one attacking the constitutionality must make out a clear case as to the unconstitutionality. The court also noted that in passing on the sufficiency of the evidence, its function was limited to ascertaining whether there was a basis, in the evidence, on which the jury could reasonably conclude that the accused was guilty. The court stated that the term &quot;confidence game&quot; in the statute was so well understood that in the absence of a request that the term be specifically defined, the failure of the trial court to define the term did not constitute error, and that the statute was constitutional. The court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

After consideration, the court granted the writ. The court concluded that the county court lacked the authority to try petitioners of the crime charged. The court held that the prohibition in Okla. Const. art. 7, &sect; 12, against the exercise by the county court of jurisdiction in actions against officers for misconduct in office, included all actions against such officers for misconduct, and jurisdiction over such proceedings was in the district court. The court found that the phrase &quot;misconduct in office&quot; included any wilful malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were a homeowner and the carpenters hired by him to construct an apartment house. Defendant applied for a building permit to construct a duplex and three-car-garage on his lot. The town clerk referred the application to the president of the development corporation which developed the town. The president disapproved the application and the town clerk refused to issue the building permit. Defendant submitted new plans for a detached garage which were approved by the president. The town clerk issued a permit. Defendants then build the home according to the original plans instead of the approved plans. Defendants were arrested and filed a petition for habeas corpus. The court stated that the town had passed an ordinance establishing the position of building commissioner. The ordinance did not require that a private party approve of plans before permits were issued. The court held that the ordinance allegedly violated by defendants was so indefinite and uncertain that it could not afford a basis for the arrest of defendants. The court held that defendants' arrests were illegal.</SPAN></P>

The petitioner argued that the restraint of the petitioner by shackling his legs during the trial was an unconstitutional denial of his rights. The court stated that the restraining of a prisoner during a trial by means of shackles should not be done except in cases of extreme necessity and when the question of the need for such restraint was presented, it was addressed to the sound judicial discretion of the trial court. The court found that based on the facts, the restraint was not an abuse of discretion. Petitioner also argued that he denied due process because during the trial one of the jurors had exclaimed during the petitioner's testimony that petitioner was lying. The court concluded from the evidence that the alleged remark was not made. Finally, petitioner argued that newly discovered evidence warranted a new trial. The court stated that newly discovered evidence did not constitute a basis for granting of the writ of habeas corpus because it was not an attack on jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After observing defendant driving in an erratic manner, two officers stopped defendant's vehicle and observed that defendant spoke in an incoherent manner, had reddened eyes, smelled of liquor, and walked in a weaving manner. Subsequently, defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and fined. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's claim that certain trial errors warranted reversal of the conviction. Furthermore, the court considered defendant's claim the trial court erred in its refusal to quash the jury panel due to the deputy clerk's purposeful exclusion of women from the panel. The court held that the constitutional provision that a grand jury should be comprised of 12 men, Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 18, and another provision referring to jurors as &quot;men,&quot; Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 19, used the word &quot;men&quot; in the generic sense and included women as well. The court held, however, that defendant, a man, could not claim that any civil, political, or other right or privilege of his or of his sex was infringed, invaded, or annulled by the failure of officials to include women on the jury panel which tried him.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 12 (1951). The trial court convicted defendant of the felony offense and sentenced him to two years in jail. The court held that the provisions of &sect; 12, which made a second violation of the provisions of that title, which governed alcohol offenses, a felony, did not apply to the public drunkenness statute. The court based its decision on the legislative history of the provisions, the provisions of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 57, which governed the enactment of statutes, the fact that no other jurisdiction punished the offense as a felony, the fact that the state attorney general felt this was a misapplication of the statute, and the fact that no other county had attempted to prosecute a second offense of public drunkenness as a felony.

He appealed from the judgment of the District Court of Choctaw County (Oklahoma), contending, inter alia, that the information was fatally defective, that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, and that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury and erred in refusing to give his requested instructions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was killed when the car driven by defendant struck his car. The information alleged manslaughter in the first degree in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 711 (1951), in substance charging defendant with the two separate misdemeanors of driving his car to the left of the center line while not in the act of passing another and by driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquors. The court held that the information was not fatally duplicitous due to its alleging the two separate misdemeanors in a single count. The evidence was sufficient to support the finding of defendant's culpable negligence and, thus, his guilt of manslaughter in the second degree. The State's oversight in failing to present direct evidence of the cause of the victim's death was not fatal. There was no requirement that proof or cause of death had to be established through the media of medical evidence. There was evidence to support defendant's theory that he was passing another vehicle immediately before the collision and that the victim failed to comply with Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect;&sect;121.15 and 121.16. The trial court erred in failing to give his requested charge on that theory.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant State sought review of a judgment from County Court, Kay County (Oklahoma), which, in an action based on an information charging defendant with driving automobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (DUI), sustained defendant's demurrer to the information and dismissed the case on the theory that the State had no effective law prohibiting DUI on the date set forth in the information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court sustained the demurrer interposed by defendant on the theory that for the period from May 27, 1949 through May 15, 1951, the State had no effective law prohibiting the driving of an automobile upon a highway in the State while the driver was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, for the reason that Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 91 (1941) had been repealed by the 1949 legislature and that Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 93 (1941) did not define &quot;highway&quot; and did not set forth a place or places where the driving of an automobile under the influence of intoxicating liquor was prohibited. The court held that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the information. The court noted that in the absence of anything in the adopting statute and the circumstances surrounding its enactment to indicate a different legislative intent, the rule of construction was that a statute adopting and referring to another statute or to some of its provisions adopted and incorporated the provisions of the other statute as they existed at the time of the adoption, and no subsequent modification or repeal of the statute adopted limited, or otherwise affected the adopting statute.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and found that the officers who stopped defendant witnessed her driving over the speed limit on a highway. They knew that the limit had been only recently posted, and determined that she should only have been given a warning. After he gave her the warning, the officer noticed several bottles of whiskey that appeared above the window of the automobile. Defendant was arrested, her car was searched and 192 pints of intoxicating liquor were found. Defendant asserted that the search was illegal because the state highway commission fixed the speed limit, which was void as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The court held that irrespective of any merit to the contention that the highway commission was without power to fix speed limits, it was clear that under Okla. Stat. tit. 69, &sect; 50 (1951) the commission had the authority to post speed limit warnings and safety signs.

The inmate had entered a guilty plea to an information in the district court to the crime of burglary in the second degree, a third offense, and had been sentenced to ten years imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate argued that there was no offense defined by Oklahoma statutes as that named in the information, so his incarceration was illegal. The inmate was prosecuted under the habitual criminal statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 51(1) (1941), under which if a person was subsequently convicted of an offense that upon a first conviction would have subjected him to imprisonment in the penitentiary for any term exceeding five years, the person was subject to punishment by imprisonment in the penitentiary for a term not less than 10 years. The court had previously held &sect; 51 constitutional. Caselaw held that the punishment on conviction of second degree burglary after former conviction of a felony was any term in the penitentiary not less than 10 years. The information conformed to &sect; 51 by alleging that the inmate committed the crime of burglary in the second degree after being formerly convicted of two felonies and by setting forth each of the former convictions. The fact that more than one former conviction was set forth in the information did not invalidate it. The inmate was not entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of his conviction of the County Court, Le Flore County (Oklahoma). He was charged by an information with the offense of transportation of intoxicating liquor. Defendant's motion to suppress was overruled. He was tried before a jury and convicted of transporting intoxicating liquor. He was sentenced to 30 days in the county jail and fined.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant urged, inter alia, that his motion to suppress boxes of liquor was improperly denied. He alleged that they were illegally seized from the back of his pickup truck in a warrantless search. The sheriff saw him driving in his truck in the early morning hours and followed him. As the sheriff drove up, he saw defendant standing at the door of a building, known to the sheriff as a place handling liquor, and holding a case of whiskey. The box was unopened but was stamped &quot;Whiskey&quot; on the outside. The back of defendant's pickup truck was open. Other sealed boxes marked &quot;Whiskey&quot; were viewed in the rear of the truck by the sheriff. The court affirmed the judgment. While defendant claimed that the boxes in the truck were so placed that the lettering could not be read without moving them, the boxes had shifted such that the word &quot;Whiskey&quot; was in plain view. The officers had a right to be watchful and observe defendant's truck thought to be on the way to a place handling liquor. The fact that they looked into the truck and saw the whiskey, which was not concealed, obviated the need for a search. Thus, as there was no unconstitutional search, the liquor was admissible.</SPAN></P>

He went into the headquarters and in less than five minutes returned with an armload of supplies for use in certain Scout work in which he was engaged. On reaching his car, he found a patrolman preparing a traffic ticket for parking in a loading zone. The particular place in which defendant had parked his car was marked as restricted for loading purposes. Over defendant's protest of his right to use the zone for the purpose, for which it was designated, he was given a ticket. The court concluded that the ordinance in question was not subject to the constitutional objections made against it. There was some discrimination between commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles, but the City had the authority to make such classification under the police power granted to it by the State, and its classification in this instance had a reasonable relation to the traffic conditions sought to be remedied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor and was sentenced to a certain term of imprisonment. On review, defendant argued that the affidavit to obtain the search warrant was insufficient. The court found the warrant complained of sufficient. It was reasoned that the record disclosed that the deputy sheriff served the search warrant. Further, the court held that defendant offered no evidence in support of his motion to suppress, but relied on defects alleged to be apparent on the face of the affidavit for search warrant, and on the search warrant. The court held that on a motion to suppress the burden of proof was on defendant. Therefore, the court concluded that the trial court did not err in overruling the motion to suppress. Additionally, the court held that in view of the facts and in light of the schedule of punishment set forth in the governing statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 37, &sect; 12, and in the interest of the integrity of the courts and officers thereof the court found that justice dictated that the sentence be modified from one year in the penitentiary to three months in the county jail.</SPAN></P>

IV, &sect; 2, cl. 2. The federal law enacted under &sect; 2 was 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 662. The Governor of Oklahoma honored the Kansas demand for extradition pursuant to &sect; 6 of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act (UC), Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1141.6 (1949). The court found that 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 662 did not purport to cover the total field of extradition. It covered those that fled from the state in which the crime had been perpetrated and that were fugitives from justice. The UC did not provide for the extradition of people of that class but of people in a completely different class: those that perpetrated an act in one state intentionally resulting in a crime in another state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner urged that the court overlooked Okla. Stat. tit. 3, &sect; 65.16 (Supp. 1947), in determining that the operation of an airport by a municipality was a proprietary function not subject to tort immunity. Section 65.16 expressly and unequivocally declared that the operation of an airport was a public and governmental function, exercised for a public purpose. In denying the petition the court held that this declaration was merely justification for the Act, and was not determinative of the question whether the operation was governmental or proprietary. The court alluded to two jurisdictions which similarly found the operation proprietary despite similar legislative decree. The court also observed that the Act was adopted from the Uniform Airport Act, and contained in Okla. Stat. tit. 3, &sect; 20 (Supp. 1947), a declaration that it should be construed so as to make uniform so far as possible the laws and regulations of Oklahoma and other states and of the government of the United States.</SPAN></P>

A city operating a municipal airport terminal owned by it was engaged in a purely &quot;corporate capacity&quot; or &quot;proprietary capacity&quot; and not in a &quot;governmental capacity.&quot; The court found that the city, in entering into a contract with a third person to provide airport limousine service, was not granting a &quot;franchise&quot; to the third person within meaning of constitutional provisions prohibiting the granting of an exclusive &quot;franchise&quot; without an election.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the amendment to the information was one as to form so as to more clearly set forth the prior convictions of defendant. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to strike the case from the assignment because of the filing of the amended information on the date of the trial. Defendant also contended that the verdict of the jury was contrary to the evidence. The court held that although the evidence was wholly circumstantial, if believed by the jury it was sufficient to authorize them to conclude that the liquor which was found belonged to defendant and that he had it for the purpose of sale. Finally, defendant argued that the trial court committed fundamental error in its instructions to the jury. The court affirmed the judgment and stated that it found no errors of sufficient importance to justify or require a reversal of the conviction.</SPAN></P>

After consideration, the court denied the inmate relief. The court held that a municipality under its police power could have determined, within constitutional limitations, what was dangerous and injurious to public order, safety, health, morals, and general welfare of the community. The court ruled that, if the inmate had appealed to the county or district court and, in case of an adverse judgment, to the court, the evidence would have been preserved, and the court would not have been limited in scope of its review. The court concluded that the inmate could not be discharged under a writ of habeas corpus unless the trial court lacked jurisdiction, and its judgment was void, however numerous and gross the errors were at trial. A writ of habeas corpus could not take the place of an appeal.</SPAN></P>

An issue presented on appeal was the constitutionality of Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 101-114a, by which the child had been committed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Besides custody, the trial court had given the Division authority to consent to the child's adoption. The trial court had found the child under &sect; 101 to be dependent, neglected, and delinquent. There was no perfected appeal of the trial court's order giving the Division custody. The court stated that it was limited on the habeas corpus application to deciding whether or not the trial court had jurisdiction. The mother argued that the trial court was without jurisdiction where the underlying statutes were unconstitutional. A constitutional argument was that the breaking up and sequestering of the family was cruel and unusual punishment under the Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 9. To the court, the judgment at issue did not attempt to inflict punishment and &sect; 9 was not applicable. Under the power of the legislature to enact the statutory scheme of Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 101-114a, the court cited precedent to the effect that children were mainly wards of the State and that the State had the inherent power to legislate for children's welfare and to put each child with either parent at will or to remove the child from both parents.

After payment of his fine, defendant filed his motion in the justice of the peace court to reassess costs, which was denied, Defendant appealed to the trial court with like result, after which he brought his appeal to the court. Defendant asserted that the assessment of the one dollar for the fund was unconstitutional. The court noted that there was no procedure for the retaxing of costs in criminal cases. The court held that, in such a case, defendant could either appeal his entire case pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1051 (1941) or by filing for a writ of habeas corpus. However, the court held that because defendant paid his fine and assessed costs, his complaint regarding the fine and costs was rendered moot, and the court had no jurisdiction over the matter.</SPAN></P>

The trial court erred in overruling defendant's demurrer and imposing sentence for a second and subsequent offense. The trial court was without jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment and sentence rendered because there was not proof to support the first and second offenses relied upon to bring the case within the provisions of &sect; 12, and it was reversible error for the trial court to do so. Moreover, if the evidence had been sufficient to sustain a judgment and sentence for the offense as laid in the information under the provisions of &sect; 12, the judgment and sentence would be void because the trial court did not impose a fine of not less than $ 50, the mandatory minimum provided by Okla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of his conviction of the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma). He was charged by information with unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor under Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 37, &sect; 31 (1941), and, as he was a third offender, it was alleged that he was a habitual violator of the prohibition laws. He was convicted by a jury and sentenced to a year and a day in prison under Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 37, &sect; 14 (1941).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The jury had been instructed, under Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 37, &sect; 14 (1941), that the minimum penalty that could be imposed was not less than one year. Defendant urged that the district court erred in instructing the jury under said statute, as it had been repealed by implication by Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 37, &sect; 12 (1941). Finding merit in his claim, the court reversed the judgment. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 37, &sect; 12 (1941) was all embracing as to second, and all subsequent, violations of the liquor prohibition act. The legislative intent was clear to repeal of Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 37, &sect; 14 (1941) so as to bring second and all subsequent offenders, such as defendant, within its provisions and to make the penalties for enhanced punishment therein conform to the minimum set under Okla. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7. Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 37, &sect; 12 (1941) was exclusive as to the subject of habitual violators of the liquor prohibition act. The court held that Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 37, &sect; 12 (1941) was intended to, and did, repeal Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 37, &sect; 14 (1941), though no express reference was made thereto in Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 37, &sect; 12 (1941). Also, the legislature had the power to do so.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment. The court ordered that a new trial be granted to defendant under the same information and remanded the case for that purpose with directions to instruct the jury under the appropriate statutory provision covering his second and all subsequent violations of any of the provisions of the prohibition act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the inmate was convicted of vagrancy by being a prostitute, she was held in the city jail for two venereal disease tests to be taken at least 48 hours apart and repeated for four successive weeks in accordance with a rule promulgated by the Oklahoma Commissioner of Health to achieve the legislative intent of Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect;&sect; 548 and 552.2 (Supp. 1947). The inmate filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus and asserted that the statutes were violative of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 1. The court disagreed and held that the statutes and the rule were legitimate exercises of the State's police power to achieve the important goal of protecting the public health. The inmate also argued that her conviction in the municipal court was not the type of conviction which fell within the purview &sect; 548 and that it was necessary that she be arrested under warrant in order to be detained for examination for venereal disease. The court denied the writ. The court held that the municipal judge, acting in the capacity of a local health officer, could, after the inmate's conviction for the sex offense charged, detain the inmate for examination for venereal disease.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that a federal liquor license, which was not introduced, in defendant's name could have been issued for another location, that a bartender's statement that defendant owned the whiskey was validly excluded as hearsay, and that evidence that defendant was in the club on a date prior to the raid did not establish that he operated the club. The court also held that &sect; 366(10) was not intended to limit the powers and duties of investigators of the bureau of criminal identification and that the provisions of Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In habeas corpus proceedings, petitioner inmate complained that he was illegally restrained of his liberty in the Oklahoma State Reformatory at Granite. The inmate contended that under the statutes of Oklahoma, in particular Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 105 (1941), and by reason of judgments and sentences pronounced against him, he being a confirmed criminal, may not be kept at the reformatory, but should be returned to the penitentiary at McAlester.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate claimed that the Oklahoma State Board of Public Affairs (Board) made an illegal order that transferred him from the penitentiary at McAlester, Oklahoma to the reformatory at Granite, Oklahoma. It was the contention of the Attorney General that Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 105 (1941), had been repealed prior to the preparation of the revised code in 1941, and that its inclusion in the 1941 code was erroneous and to treat the section as being in effect was contrary to a cited decision of the court in an unrelated case wherein it was held that a statute that had been held unconstitutional or repealed was not reenacted or validated by its inclusion in the 1941 code. The court opined that Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 105 (1941) was not in effect by virtue of its inclusion in the 1941 Statutes; that Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 133 (1941) was the statute governing the commitment by the trial court of prisoners to the two state penal institutions, and it required that such prisoners be sent to the nearest prison; and that the Board was thereafter vested with authority to transfer the inmate from one institution to another in performance of their duties under Okla. Stat. tit. 57, &sect; 132 (1941).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate filed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking his release from the state penitentiary where he was now confined by reason of first degree burglary conviction, after former conviction of a felony. The inmate was sentenced to 99 years imprisonment. The former convictions alleged were a conviction for the crime of robbery with firearms, a conviction for the crime of attempted rape and a conviction for the crime of larceny of an automobile. The inmate was sentenced to the state penitentiary in all of the cases. The inmate contended violation of his equal protection rights. The inmate contended error in a greater sentence being placed on second offenders under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 51. The court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 51 since it was noted that habitual criminal statutes did not create or define a new or independent crime, but more severely penalized because of previous convictions. The court denied the habeas corpus petition but stated that though the inmate's sentence was long, 99 years, that the inmate and others had the avenue of the parole and pardon board to seek release early, since they could look at justice and mercy in their decisions.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted summary judgment for OTC. The appellate court affirmed, adopting the construction of Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 500.63 that rendered it constitutional. Contracts created pursuant to that statute were compacts as authorized by 25 U.S.C.S. &sect; 476(e).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mother and appellee father divorced while the mother was pregnant. After the birth of their daughter, visitation became a point of contention. Appellants, father's parents (grandparents), filed a petition to intervene in the divorce and asked for visitation with their granddaughter. Following a hearing, the trial court placed primary custody of the daughter with the mother and ordered that grandparents would be allowed to visit their granddaughter once every two weeks in conjunction with father's visitation or without father if he was unable to exercise his visitation time. The trial court's denial of grandparents' request for attorney fees was affirmed on appeal because they were not entitled to such under Okla. Stat. tit. 43, &sect; 110(c). The order allowing grandparents visitation was affirmed because the application of Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 5 to grandparents was not unconstitutional, because they had the support of the non-custodial parent and their visitation rights would be during his visitation time. The order requiring mother to pay a portion of father's attorney fees was not an abuse of discretion because mother's posture regarding visitation was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was stopped and arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. His driver's license was suspended and he requested modification to allow restricted driving privileges. The lower court granted defendant's request to modify the suspension of his license to allow him to drive to and from work and during the course of his employment. The court found that application of Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 754 that provided different punishments for individuals over and under the age of 21 was not a violation of equal protection because the classification was not inherently invidious and did not impose on a fundamental right. The court found that the statute which provided stricter punishment to individuals under the age of 21 who were convicted of drunk driving was legitimately related to permissible government means and the intended purpose to provide for traffic safety and to reduce traffic accidents, death, and property damage. The court found there was probable cause to arrest defendant and defendant failed to present a record showing the lower court erred in convicting him of driving while intoxicated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the lower court that convicted defendant of driving while intoxicated and allowed defendant to have a suspended sentence because punishments imposed for driving while intoxicated that differed depending on whether defendant was over or under 21 years of age were permissible means to a permitted government objective.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that the legislature did not vest appellee with the authority to amend the workers' compensation court's order, and without an order from the court, the state treasurer had no authority to issue a refund.

Appellants, husband and his current wife, contended that the Oklahoma grandparent visitation statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband and appellee were husband and wife. Their son was the natural father of a minor child that was the subject of this appeal. Appellant husband and appellee divorced, and appellant husband remarried appellant wife. The natural parents' rights of appellant husband and appellee's grandchild were terminated. Thereafter, appellants filed a petition seeking to become the adoptive parents of the child. Appellee sought grandparent visitation in the adoption proceeding. The lower court entered a decree approving final adoption, and granted extensive visitation rights to appellee. Subsequently, appellants moved to vacate the visitation order, arguing that the grandparent visitation statute was unconstitutional and that the child had been harmed by the forced visitation. The lower court denied the motion, and the appellate court reversed. The court held that Oklahoma's grandparent visitation statute was unconstitutional as applied to the facts of the case. On remand, the appellate court directed the lower court to vacate the order requiring appellants to permit visitation of their child with appellee.

Under Oklahoma law, children born out of wedlock could become heirs of and inherit through their father only by the methods set forth in Okla. Stat. tit. 84, &sect; 215 (1991).Here, there was no public acknowledgement by the alleged father that plaintiff was his daughter, as required by the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff creditor, holder of an account from hospital, sued defendant husband, to recover over $ 25,000 in medical expenses relating to his wife. The District Court for Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), granted summary judgment in favor of the creditor, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 43, &sect; 209 (1991). The husband appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The common law Doctrine of Necessaries was codified at Okla. Stat. tit. 43, &sect; 209 (1991), and permitted a wife, cohabiting with her husband, to incur debt for her maintenance when the husband failed in his financial obligations. The court ruled that the doctrine discriminated on the basis of sex, and perpetuated invidious, archaic, and overbroad stereotypes about the relative status of men and women in a marriage, and it could not be shown that there was an exceedingly persuasive justification for imposing an unilateral liability for debt incurred by the wife upon the husband. The court therefore ruled that the Doctrine of Necessaries was abrogated, as it violated the constitutional provision of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mother and step-father of minor child (mother and stepfather), sought review of an order of the District Court of Creek County (Oklahoma), which denied their motion for a new trial/motion to vacate/motion for change of venue/motion to terminate grandparental visitation after the district court granted grandparental visitation to appellee maternal grandparents (grandparents) in the grandparents' petition for court-ordered visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor child suffered severe emotional problems. After many months of counseling with the minor child, her therapist suggested that her visitation with the grandmother be curtailed. The grandparents filed a petition seeking court-ordered visitation. The district court granted the grandparents visitation consistent with that granted to a non-custodial parent. The mother and the stepfather filed motions to vacate, for new trial, for change of venue, and to terminate grandparental visitation. The district court denied the motions. The mother and the stepfather appealed. The court held that inasmuch as the protection of the best interests of the child was a compelling state interest and the best-interest-of-the-child test contemplated an examination of potential harm to the child in the grandparental visitation calculus, granting grandparental visitation was constitutional. However, a grandparent's right to visitation was not co-equal with that of a parent. As such, the district court's order for grandparental visitation, granting the grandparents every other weekend and extended summer visitation, akin to that of a non-custodial parent, was excessive and an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's order, denying the motion of the mother and step-father for a new trial/motion to vacate/motion for change of venue/motion to terminate grandparental visitation after granting visitation to the grandparents, and remanded the cause for further proceedings to determine whether and under what conditions the grandparents should be granted visitation.</SPAN></P>

The term of the inpatient treatment was for so long as the superintendent of the hospital felt that treatment was needed. The State had called two witnesses in support of its case: appellant and a psychiatric doctor. Appellant objected to being called as a witness by the State on 5th Amendment and statutory grounds. He also objected to the State's use of his prior criminal convictions for narcotics possession in support of its own case that he was in need of treatment and to impeach his testimony. On appeal, the court affirmed the order that committed appellant for treatment, including medication. The court found that there was no constitutional right against self-incrimination in an involuntary commitment proceeding and that Oklahoma law allowed the State to call the person alleged to be requiring treatment in support of its case. Further, the court found that there was no error in allowing the State to introduce prior criminal convictions in its case in chief for its stated purposes of proving substance abuse and impeachment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court terminated his parental rights, the father, who was not an Indian, appealed, claiming that the clear and convincing standard of proof used by the trial court under Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 7006-1.1 (Supp. 1995) violated his equal protection rights. He based his argument on the fact that in actions brought to terminate the rights of parents of Indian children, the standard of proof under the ICWA was that of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt. The court affirmed the judgment, ruling that the failure to instruct the jury that the state had to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt was not an error and did not violate the father's constitutional right to equal protection of the law. The heightened burden of proof required for termination of the rights of a parent of an Indian child was rationally tied to Congress' policy of protecting the integrity of Indian families. The court effectively ruled that the heightened burden under the ICWA did not constitute invidious discrimination of a denial of the equal protection rights of non-Indian parents. There was competent evidence that reasonably tended to support the verdict and, thus, it was not disturbed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The WCC filed an order granting the employee benefits from the fund for a material increase in permanent disability. The claimant filed a form seeking penalty, interest, and other relief for failure by the fund to timely pay the WCC order. The trial court ordered that, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 42, the fund was to pay postjudgment interest from the date of judgment until the date of satisfaction. The fund paid postjudgment interest, calculating the interest based on a fluctuating annual basis pursuant to an amendment to &sect; 42. The employee claimed that the statutory rate of interest in effect on the date of judgment controlled. The trial court ordered payment based on the fluctuating annual basis and the WCC affirmed. The employee sought judicial review of the WCC order. The court held that the terms of the WCC order awarding postjudgment interest could not be altered by after-enacted legislation. The statutory amendment of &sect; 42, as applied to injuries sustained prior to the amendment's effective date, was an unreasonable exercise of legislative authority affecting a substantive right of the employee in violation of Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer contended that the trial court erred in finding claimant to be his employee. The employer testified that he had never met or hired claimant and that claimant was working for a subcontractor the employer had hired to do a roofing job. The employer explained that his subcontractors and their employees provided their own transportation to the job sites. The court held that using the Page factors, the evidence weighed in favor of a finding that claimant was not an employee of the employer, but was much more likely to have been employed by the subcontractor. There was no written or verbal employment agreement, the employer did not in any was supervise or control the details of the work, and the employer did not pay claimant, but paid the subcontractor, who paid claimant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sports company sought to broadcast live, play-by-play radio accounts of a local football game. Prior to game day, the school district demanded payment for broadcast rights fee. The sports company brought this action for injunctive relief, claiming that the school district had neither the express nor implied authority to collect a broadcast fee, and that such levy infringed upon the sports company's First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of injunctive relief, holding that the school district possessed the powers incidental to the exercise of the powers granted under Okla. Stat. tit. 70, &sect; 5-117. The court found that it had been held that school districts had the implied power to charge and college broadcast rights and fees, and that even though they treated the sports company differently than other types of news gathers, it was not unconstitutional. Because the school district was acting in its proprietary capacity, and not in a governmental matter, the constitutional proscription did not apply.</SPAN></P>

The city published an ordinance that changed the suspension of suspension of certificate, as well as the notice and hearing provisions for persons holding certificates to operate vehicles for hire. Another city ordinance required all drivers of vehicles for hire to complete a driver's training program before receiving certificates. The court held that the ordinance did not violate any city, state, or federal law, and was therefore constitutional. The ordinance was enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to the city, and its stated purpose was to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants and visitors to the city.

The trial court erred in denying the owners' request for a jury trial because Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 19 required a jury trial in civil actions to forfeit property. The forfeiture statute was not unconstitutional because it did not provide that a claimant was not entitled to a jury trial; it was silent on the subject. The trial court also erred in including the owners' real property in the order of forfeiture. Because the forfeiture statute did not include real property, it was deemed excluded.

The court noted that notice of adoption was not required to be given to a parent whose parental rights had previously been terminated; thus, the natural parents had no appealable interest in the case as aggrieved parties.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding, petitioners, an employer and its insurance carrier, sought review of an order of respondent Workers' Compensation Court (Oklahoma), which appointed an independent medical examiner (IME) in a case where respondent benefits claimant had not submitted any medical evidence in support of his cumulative trauma claim at the time he sought and received appointment of the IME.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents argued that the appointment of an IME prior to submission of the claimant's medical evidence exceeded the compensation court's authority. The court agreed. Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 17(D)(3) (1996) did not authorize appointment of an IME in a cumulative trauma case prior to a claimant's submission of medical evidence, unless both parties requested appointment. Both Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 17(D)(3) and (F) gave the parties the right to request or stipulate to an IME in the absence of any divergent medical testimony or any medical testimony at all. This right to &quot;stipulate,&quot; coupled with the claimant's burden of proof under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 27 (1991), indicated a legislative intent that IME appointments at the request of one party or on the compensation court's own motion were to be preceded by a medical evidence controversy. Although Workers' Comp. Ct. R. 43(A), Okla. Stat. tit. 85, ch. 4, app. (Supp. 1996) provided that any party could request appointment of an IME, even without any medical testimony, it exceeded the authority of Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 17(D)(3), and could not support an IME appointment absent medical evidence unless both parties so stipulated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee sustained a job-related injury to her knee, which required surgery. The bill sent to the employer's insurance carrier did not indicated any amount due from the employee. The employer received partial payment from the insurance carrier pursuant to an order of the workers' compensation court. The employer sought the outstanding balance from the employee. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the district court lacked jurisdiction to impose liability on the employee. The court reasoned that the workers' compensation court had clearly imposed liability upon the employer for payment of the employee's worker's compensation claims and, therefore, invoked the workers' compensation court's primary jurisdiction pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 14(E) (1995). The court found that until the employer was absolved of liability, the employee was immune from accountability by the district court. The court found that it was immaterial that the employer filed a satisfaction of judgment because, at the time the district court entered the default judgment against the employee, it was required to defer to the workers' compensation court upon proper notice.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that his consent was not required for the adoption.

The court determined that the father had a constitutionally protected interest to develop a relationship with his child but that he had to grasp the opportunity. The court stated that notice was only required where the father was able to demonstrate that he seized his parental opportunity or that he was prevented from doing so. Therefore, the court noted that Okla. Stat. tit 10, &sect; 60.6(3)(a) and (b) (1991) did not apply to the father because he had not asserted any positive acts of parental responsibility. The court stated that there was no evidence that the mother denied the father any opportunity to exercise his parental rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimant appealed a decision of the three-judge panel of the Workers' Compensation Court (Oklahoma), which held that respondents, a general contractor and the independent subcontractor for whom the claimant worked, were not liable for an award of benefits under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 11(B)(2). The general contractor had relied in good faith on the subcontractor's certification of non-coverage under the Workers' Compensation Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A workers' compensation claimant worked for a subcontractor who had certified to the general contractor that its employees were not covered under the Workers' Compensation Act. The certification was valid. There was no dispute that the subcontractor was an independent contractor. Although the trial court awarded workers' compensation benefits to the claimant, the workers' compensation court held that the contractor, as &quot;principal employer,&quot; was not liable under Okla. Stat. tit. 85, &sect; 11(B)(2). On appeal, the claimant argued that the non-coverage exception to principal employer liability was unconstitutional. The court explained that the state legislature had created the Workers Compensation Act in the exercise of its police power, which could not be delegated. None but the legislature could classify the kind of employment that was subject to the Act. The legislature was free to create a principal employer exception for subcontractors' employees; but it could not delegate to employers the power to determine whether the employees were included or excluded from coverage.</SPAN></P>

The award was granted pursuant to the Surface Damages Act Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect;&sect; 318.2 - 318.9 (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied the landowner's request for disbursement of the award because her request was not filed within the five-year time limit provided for execution on judgments in Okla.

The court rejected the landowner's argument that the award was payable upon the grounds that once the appraisers' award was approved by the trial court, the corporation should have paid the amount of the award into court. The court held that the award, once confirmed by the trial court, and after affirmance on appeal, was a judgment subject to the dormancy statute. Therefore, when the landowner failed to seek enforcement within five years after the mandate was spread of record, the award became unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the city failed to demonstrate that the Department did not have jurisdiction to hear the employee's wage claim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the governor and a non-resident individual, appealed from the District Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, which found in favor of appellee, the Oklahoma Tax Commission, in the declaratory judgment challenging the constitutionality of a state senate bill, which changed the method of calculating state income tax for nonresident and part-year resident individuals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants contended that the bill was a &quot;revenue bill,&quot; and so was unconstitutional because it was enacted contrary to the requirements of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 33. Appellants also contended the bill was invalid under the Oklahoma Constitution because it embraced more than one subject. In addition, appellants raised equal protection, due process, and Commerce Clause objections to the bill. The commission was correct to characterize the bill as merely a change in the way the tax laws were administered. The bill's principal object was not to raise revenue, and it did not levy a tax in the strict sense. That it had the incidental effect of increasing general revenues did not mean make it a revenue bill. The court found that the bill did not violate the one-subject rule of Okla. Const. art. V, &sect; 57. Appellants' various other constitutional challenges were based on their contention that the bill imposed an indirect tax on income derived outside of the state. The commission properly responded that the bill did not impose a tax on such out-of-state income, but merely used that income in calculating the rate at which Oklahoma-derived income would be taxed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was required to forfeit his vehicle as a result of his son's action of using the car to transport cocaine. Defendant claimed the &quot;innocent owner&quot; defense because he had loaned the car to his son for a trip to New Mexico to search for a job. The district attorney argued that lack of knowledge or consent alone did not prevent forfeiture unless the son's possession of the vehicle was also &quot;unlawful.&quot; The trial court agreed with the district attorney that both showings were required by Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-503(A)(4)(b) (1995 Supp.). On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for return of the car to defendant. The court held that the trial court erred in rejecting defendant's &quot;innocent owner&quot; defense and in forfeiting the vehicle. The trial court improperly considered federal court cases construing federal forfeiture statutes, which were not controlling. Such federal statutes were primarily penal, whereas Oklahoma's forfeiture statutes were primarily remedial. Also, literal application of &sect; 2-503(A)(4)(b) denied defendant equal protection by affording his innocent ownership lesser and different protection than afforded other innocent owners and ownership interests.</SPAN></P>

The assessment amount included gross production taxes which were due, petroleum excise taxes which were due, interest, and penalties, and was based upon alleged &quot;take-or-pay&quot; settlements between the gas seller and certain natural gas producers. The gas seller first filed a protest to the assessment and then a judicial appeal after the protest was denied by the Commission. The gas seller argued that the Commission's assessment was not supported by sufficient evidence and that the assessment violated substantive due process, equal protection, and the commerce clause of the federal and state constitutions. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the Commission's determinations were properly designated as payments made to settle take-or-pay deficiencies and were supported by substantial evidence. The court concluded that the gas seller's assignments of error were unsupported by convincing argument or authority, and that legislative acts were presumed constitutional unless they were clearly inconsistent with the constitution.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1009(g). The corporation appealed. On appeal, the corporation argued that it produced uncontroverted evidence that the entire prepayment was not a take-or-pay payment and therefore, not subject to Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1009(g). However, the court determined that there was substantial evidence in the record from which the commission could have concluded that the prepayment made by the corporation was a take-or-pay settlement and not simply to secure future production. The corporation further argued that the assessment violated the uniformity requirement of Okla. Const. art. 10, &sect; 5. However, the court determined that the fact that Okla. Stat. tit. 68, &sect; 1009(g) provided that take-or-pay payments would be included in and deemed a part of the value of all gas taken under contract did not render it unconstitutional as violative of Okla.

The trial court denied the store's request for an injunction, and the store sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the attorney's advertisement was not false or misleading because while the lawsuit had not been certified as a class action, it was filed as a class action, and could properly be considered a class action until the trial court denied certification. Thus, it was not misleading for the attorneys to reference a class action in the advertisement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant architectural firm (architect) appealed the decision of the District Court of Carter County (Oklahoma) overruling its motion to compel arbitration in plaintiff hospital's lawsuit for damages. The complaint alleged that the architect failed to provide proper and adequate architectural services in the renovation and construction to the hospital's medical facility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital sought to avoid arbitration by asserting that the architect's acts falling within the purview of the contract's arbitration provision were intermixed with claims of negligence. On appeal, the architect argued that the trial court erred when it found that the contract did not involve commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1-307 et seq., requiring arbitration, was inapplicable. In reversing the judgment, the court held that the action contained a significant breach of contract claim and that the contract involved interstate commerce. The court also held that the commerce clause language was to be read broadly and the phrase &quot;involving commerce&quot; meant affecting commerce. Thus, as the architectural service contract involved the architect in most phases of the construction project, it was interrelated to the project. The hospital's dealings in interstate commerce, as evidenced by the foreign entities that consulted with the hospitals, the foreign suppliers and manufacturers with which the hospital dealt, and the construction materials manufactured and shipped by foreign entities, clearly demonstrated its involvement in interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's judgment and remanded the cause with instructions to enter an order directing the parties to submit the controversy to arbitration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The license holder had her license revoked after a patron at her bar was arrested and pled guilty to being drunk in public. The revocation was grounded in Okla. Stat. tit. 37, &sect; 163.11(I)(1) (1992), which provided for beverage license revocation if a license holder permitted any intoxicated person to loiter in or around his place of business. On appeal, the license holder argued that the statutory language was unconstitutionally vague. The court agreed. The court noted that section 163.11(I)(1) clearly required the act of loitering in conjunction with the condition of intoxication. Thus, it was not sufficient that an intoxicated person merely be present on or about the licensed premises -- the intoxicated person must loiter to trigger the statute. The question was how the licensee, in order to protect his or her license, could distinguish between an intoxicated person who was merely present and one who was loitering. In the absence of a statutory definition of loitering, or one found in our common law, the court found the language in controversy was too vague to afford a practicable test for the licensee to make such a distinction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's order that revoked the license holder's beverage license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband and wife owned a commercial laundromat, and they initially received their water from the utility. Later they decided to obtain water from the rural water district, but the utility sought a declaratory judgment that it had the exclusive right to furnish water within its corporate limits, where the laudromat was located. The utility also sought a permanent injunction to prohibit the rural water district from furnishing water. The trial court ruled for the utility on the basis that the rural water district lacked authority to provide the water because the utility had the exclusive right to do so. On review, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling in part and reversed in part. The court found that no exclusive right in the utility existed under Okla. Const. art. XVIII, &sect; 7, and it held that the husband and wife should not have been enjoined from seeking alternative sources of water. The court found that because the laundromat was within the city limits, however, it was not within the territory of the rural water district. Thus, under Okla. Stat. tit. 82, &sect; 1324.3 (1991), it was not error for the trial court to enjoin that district from providing water.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the issuance of an injunction to prevent the rural water district from providing water, but it reversed the issuance of an injunction to prevent the husband and wife from obtaining water from any entity other than the utility. The court upheld the grant of summary judgment for the utility on a different basis that that of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court found no rational basis for the population cap that operated to exclude a certain county from the option of county home rule. The court found that by judicially severing the population cap, the county would have been eligible to proceed under the new act.

Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 165 (1991) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Commission. On appeal, the court held that because the district court had subject matter jurisdiction it was error to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. The state of Oklahoma was not a person under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 so it was immune, was not a proper party to the case, and was properly dismissed. Appellees were not persons for the purpose of the claim for a refund under &sect; 1983 so they were properly dismissed from that claim. Appellees acting in their official capacities were proper parties to the claim for declaratory relief because they were persons for the purpose of &sect; 1983 as to that claim. The claim for injunctive relief under &sect; 1983 was properly dismissed because it was moot, as the challenged law was repealed. However, the dismissal of the claim for declaratory relief was improper because two appellants paid the disputed fee under protest so they were entitled to refunds under Okla. Stat. tit. 62, &sect; 206(A) if the statute and rules were declared unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The corporation asserted it was denied a fair trial and that there had been a secret agreement between the guardian and defendant grandparents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children lived with their parents and grandparents, in the grandparents home. They received serious burn injuries in a fire the children started while playing with a cigarette lighter made by the corporation. The guardian brought a negligence and product liability action against the corporation. The jury awarded actual and punitive damages in excess of $ 24 million. On appeal, the court rejected the corporation's claim that the guardian and the grandparents had entered a secret, &quot;Mary Carter&quot; agreement, where a defendant directly benefitted from an award. The court reasoned that there was no evidence showing an agreement and noted that the grandparents' defense had been to place fault with the corporation just as the corporation tried to claim the grandparents' negligence was the cause of the children's' injuries. The court also held that punitive damages were proper because the evidence supported an inference of reckless disregard to the general public; however, it found that when punitive damages were added to the awards, the total verdict became grossly excessive. Therefore it held that remittitur was appropriate, reducing punitive damages to $ 1 million per child.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined the re-commencement of actions provision did not extend the time prescribed within which to sue a political subdivision, and dismissed the case. The executors' right to commence the action against the city existed only if instituted within 180 days after denial of the claim as required by the specifically authorized enactment of Okla.

The dismissal of the original action signified the ending of the lawsuit and no jurisdiction remained in the trial court for the executors to go forward with the original action.

The ex-wife had filed the action alleging that she was the beneficiary of her ex-husband's life insurance policy and seeking to recover the proceeds of the policy, which had been paid to decedent's widow.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent was married to the ex-wife when a life insurance policy on the decedent's life was issued by the insurer in 1974. The decedent and the ex-wife were divorced, but the divorce decree did not mention the policy. Decedent remarried, but the beneficiary designation in the life insurance policy was never changed. Upon proof of decedent's death, the insurer paid the benefit under the policy to the decedent's widow. The insurer claimed that it acted in accordance with Okla. Stat. tit. 15, &sect; 178 (1987), which revoked the policy's designation of the ex-wife after her divorce from the decedent. The ex-wife filed suit and the trial court sustained the insurer's motion. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the retrospective application of the statute was unconstitutional. When &sect; 178 was enacted and made applicable to previously issued life insurance policies, the legislature was attempting to impair the obligation of an existing and valid contract. That was held to violate U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, cl. 1. The statute was not unconstitutional when it was applied prospectively. The insurer knew, from its own records, that the designated beneficiary was the ex-wife.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed a paternity action against the father while she was pregnant. She dismissed the action without prejudice the day before the state supreme court declared the three-year statute of limitations under Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 83 (1981) unconstitutional. The legislature amended &sect; 83 authorizing the commencement of a paternity action any time before the child's 18th birthday. The mother filed the second action more than six years later. The trial court found that because the mother dismissed her case before the old limitations period was struck down, a new action was required by the child's fourth birthday, under the saving statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 100 (1981). The court disagreed. When Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 83 (1981) was declared unconstitutional, the mother's action was not barred by the three-year statute of limitations. Thus, the supreme court ruling affected any further action to determine paternity. The court also found that if the savings statute was applied to add a year to the mother's right to sue, then the mother's action was not time barred when the amendment to &sect; 83 took effect. Therefore, the time for filing her claim was extended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgage holder filed an in rem proceeding against an individual for foreclosure of a purchase money first mortgage on property located in Oklahoma County. The City filed a dilapidation lien against the property, recorded after the filing of the mortgage holder's lien. The mortgage holder claimed the dilapidation statute under which the City asserted priority of lien was unconstitutional. The trial court granted City's motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed finding that although there was a substantial impairment of the obligations of contract, the private parties to the contract were on notice that the state could assert a superior lien for costs of removing dilapidated structures from the property under the statute. The court held the state had a significant interest in regulation of the public's health and safety without the requirement of emergency and that the regulation was legitimate because the state was exercising its police power and not providing a benefit to special interests. The court held the statute was based on reasonable conditions and appropriate to its purpose and thus did not violate state or federal constitutional law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff father, individually and on behalf of his minor child, appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Cleveland County (Oklahoma), which sustained defendant physician's motion for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that both the child's action and the father's action were barred by the statutes of limitations of Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 96 (1991) and Okla. Stat. tit. 76, &sect; 18 (1991), respectively. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment as to the father's individual action and reversed the judgment as to the child's action. The court found that a prior decision was dispositive of the child's claim because it held that Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 96 (1991) was unconstitutional in that it differentiated between a minor with a medical malpractice claim and a minor with a negligence claim. The child's action was not time barred. Although Okla. Stat. tit. 76, &sect; 18 (1991) had also been held unconstitutional in that it limited an action to three years from the date of the injury without regard to discovery of the injury, the court found that the trial court applied the two-year limitation period from the date of the discovery of the injury to bar the father's claim. The court declined to hold that the tolling provisions applicable to the child's action inured to the benefit of the father's claim for medical expenses. His claim had been extinguished by the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the State obtained an order adjudicating the parents' children deprived, the trial court issued a service plan, which included certain attendance requirements with regard to therapy and parenting sessions. The trial court subsequently found that the parents had failed to meet those requirements and other criteria specified by the plan. Their parental rights were terminated as a result. The parents appealed from that order, which was reversed. The matter was remanded for a new trial. The court stated that a service plan was simply a means used by the parties to prove their cases in termination actions brought pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1130(A)(3) (1991). Therefore, a termination had to be based on a parent's failure to correct the conditions that led to the adjudication of deprived child, instead of his failure to comply with the plan. The court found that the evidence was insufficient to establish, clearly and convincingly, that termination was in the children's best interest. In that regard, it noted that the State had relied too heavily on hearsay provided by agencies entrusted with the duty of helping the parents.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank foreclosed on two mortgages on homes owned by appellant.

The trial court temporarily enjoined appellant from distributing such literature. On appeal, the court held that the temporary injunction was issued in error because (1) findings of &quot;false statements, tending to injure&quot; were insufficient to meet the elements of Okla. Stat. tit. 6, &sect; 1413 (1991), which required false, malicious, unprivileged statements which were uttered for the purpose of injuring the bank; (2) even had the statutory elements been met, there was insufficient showing of irreparable harm, especially because there existed adequate remedies at law; and (3) the guarantee of speech being of constitutional dimension in a commercial situation, the customer's speech should not have been restrained a priori without a showing not only of falsity and harm, but of conspiracy, coercion, or intimidation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife was named as beneficiary on a life insurance policy, an IRA account, and a pension plan. The amounts were paid to her at the former husband's death. The circuit court imposed a constructive trust on the funds for the benefit of the husband's estate. On appeal, the court reversed as to the life insurance policy and affirmed in all other respects. Divorce decree provisions were not to be construed as a renunciation of an expectancy unless it clearly appeared that the agreement was intended to deprive the ex-spouse of such a right. Although the decree required the husband to maintain a life insurance policy in an amount equal to the unpaid alimony, it was not clear that the wife was renouncing all her rights as a beneficiary under the policy, and she was thus entitled to all the proceeds, including those over and above the amount of the unpaid alimony. As to the proceeds of the IRA account and the pension and profit sharing plan, a specific dollar figure was stated on the record which represented exactly one-half of the amount of the pension and profit sharing fund. Thus the wife's agreement to receive only one-half of the amounts involved was explicitly shown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court heard motions filed by bondsmen in nine consolidated criminal cases. In seven of them the bondsmen had captured and returned the bail jumpers to state custody within 90 days after judgments of forfeiture had been entered. In the other two cases the bondsmen were unable to retrieve the bailees within the 90 day period, but timely paid the amount of the forfeiture, and then successfully caught and returned the escapees to custody within 180 of receipt of the notice. The issue was whether the effect of a legislative amendment to the bail bond statutes,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 1332(C), (E), which eliminated the trial court's discretion with regard to bond forfeitures, unconstitutionally offended the separation of powers doctrine by impermissibly encroaching on the court's power to control its docket. The amendment provided that when a defendant was returned to custody within the 90 day period the forfeiture must be vacated. The trial court held the amendment was unconstitutionally void. On appeal, the court agreed with the bondsmen that the amendment did not violate the doctrine of separation of powers and vacated the orders rejecting the motions to vacate bond forfeitures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff licensee challenged an order of the District Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma, which sustained the State's revocation of his driver's license pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 754(E)(2) on which the licensee's action for de novo judicial review of that revocation was based. Further, the licensee's renewed objection to the grant of the oral motion for a continuance that the State filed on the original trial date was overruled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensee alleged error as to granting the continuance and regarding the ruling that there was adequate evidence that he refused to timely consent to a breath test. The court vacated the revocation order, concluding that granting the continuance over the licensee's objection was a prejudicial abuse of discretion and that the record showed that he timely consented to take the breath test. The court reasoned that the undisputed evidence showed that the licensee asked about taking a blood test before arriving at the police station, that he made other inquiries when the arresting officer asked if he would take the designated breath test, and that his post-booking requests to be given the breath test were unfairly denied. The court also held that, because separation of powers principles precluded the legislature from unduly interfering in judicial procedure, the district court's failure to hold a trial within the period under Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 6.211(E) (1991) was not improper but that granting the continuance was erroneous because the State did not file the affidavit that Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 668 (1991) required when a continuance was based on a witness's absence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the order of revocation on which the licensee's action for de novo judicial review of the revocation of his driver's license was based.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to that proceeding, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the State and the car owner sought review. The court held that the &quot;innocent owner&quot; defense was recognized in Oklahoma, and that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the State in light of evidence that the owner was in fact unaware of her friend's intention to use her car for an illegal purpose. The court reasoned that to construe the forfeiture statute in any other way would render the statute unconstitutional, noting that &sect; 2-506(H), (J) specifically provided that seized property be returned to an innocent owner when she proved an absence of &quot;any knowledge&quot; or reason to believe that the property was to be used for the purpose charged.</SPAN></P>

Appellants filed suit on the ground that appellee city sold a hospital in violation of the City of Moore, Oklahoma, Charter &sect; 4-4, and the city did not receive consideration from the sale, which made the sale an unconstitutional gift to appellee limited partnership.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants stated that the cause of action was the illegal transfer of the hospital pursuant to the sale agreement, which was separate from an earlier cause of action that involved the illegal expenditure of public funds pursuant to the hospital management agreement. In affirming the judgment, the court found that for purposes of applying the bar of collateral estoppel, there was identity of parties. The limited partnership was the successor to a medical company. The limited partnership was the grantee of the deed to the hospital and therefore was in privity with the medical company, which was named as a defendant in appellants' first suit. Further, the councilmen in the present cause stood in the same capacities and in the same antagonistic relation as those named in the first suit. Also, public trust did not fall within the purview of Okla. Stat. tit. 62, &sect;&sect; 372 and 373 (1991), and the evidence established that appellees were duly authorized officers of non-city entities and were carrying out the responsibilities of those offices.

The court affirmed the trial court's order and judgment, conditioned on remittitur of half of the awarded punitive damages. The court held in part (1) that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on res ipsa loquitur, as there was expert evidence that the patient's injuries would not have occurred if the hospital's patient identification procedures had been followed; and (2) that the punitive damages award was excessive, as it was larger than reason dictated was necessary to deter such conduct in the hospital and others similarly situated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a worker in the private sector contended that Okla. Stat. tit. 68, 2358(D)(9) (Supp. 1989), which grants an income tax exemption only to the recipients of state and federal government retirement benefits, impermissibly discriminated against recipients of private non-governmental retirement benefits. The court rejected the taxpayer's contention that there was no rational basis for the disparate tax treatment of retirement benefits of public and private retirees. The fact that the exemption had been reduced did not make the exemption unconstitutional. Even with a lesser exemption there was still a benefit, which was rationally related to the state's interest in hiring and retaining qualified government employees. That a 1990 Annual Compensation Report undercut the argument that state workers made less in benefits than private employees for that specific year did not undercut the argument as a whole. Economic conditions fluctuated, but the state was charged with making a policy that considered short term and long-term considerations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant oil company challenged an order issued by appellee Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which amended Okla. Corp. Comm'n R. Prac. 8-2. The amended Rule 8-2(H) required consent from at least 50 percent of impacted oil well operators before any horizontal well units would be permitted. The company asserted that the Commission had improperly delegated its statutory authority to private operators.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission amended Rule 8-2, a rule regarding the establishment of horizontal well units, and made its authorization of a unit contingent upon the voluntary consent of at least 50 percent of the ownership having a drilling right in the impacted area. The company had argued, before the rule was adopted, that no consent should be required and that, by requiring consent, the Commission was impermissibly delegating its power to private individuals. The company renewed its claim after the Commission issued an order that adopted the rule amendment. In affirming, the court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 52, &sect; 87.1(f) (Supp. 1990) gave the Commission broad authority to establish spacing rules for horizontally drilled oil wells. The order was supported by substantial evidence concerning the units and their potential impact on existing producing units. The amended rule provided an equitable election process for the formation of the units. No improper delegation of authority had occurred.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the Commission's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' son was stopped for a traffic violation while he was driving the owners' automobile. The officer saw a passenger try to stuff a baggie containing green leafy substance into her boot. Subsequently, the son pleaded guilty to simple possession of marijuana. The State gave notice of seizure and forfeiture of the automobile to the owners. They answered that they were innocent of any wrongdoing and did not know that drugs were in the automobile. The trial court rejected the owners' &quot;innocent owner&quot; defense, and entered its order declaring the defendant car forfeited to the State. On appeal, the court held that Oklahoma statutory law, Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect;&sect; 2-503(A)(4)(a), 2-503(A)(4)(b), 2-503(A)(8), 2-506(H) (Supp. 1990), recognized an &quot;innocent owner&quot; defense to forfeiture actions. Such defenses were granted to common carriers, other innocent owners of real and personal property, and security interest holders. The court concluded that to hold that the defenses did not apply to the owners would render the statutes unconstitutional for denying the owners equal protection under the law. The matter was remanded for consideration of the owners' &quot;innocent owner&quot; defense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 59, &sect; 858-312(8).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real estate broker agreed to purchase property from a client of her real estate agency at the client's asking price.

The broker challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 858-312(8), alleging that it was vague and subject to subjective and arbitrary interpretation. Affirming the suspension, the court held that &sect; 858-312(8) was not unconstitutionally vague. Breach of fiduciary duty or failure to act in good faith were the types of untrustworthy and improper dealings the statute was attempting to reach in protecting the public. The court held that &sect; 858-312(8) simply held a real estate licensee to the full range of fiduciary duties not otherwise covered by the other 20 causes listed for suspension.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife challenged a judgment of the District Court of Pittsburg County (Oklahoma), which granted a motion filed by appellee, the personal representative (PR) of her former husband's estate thereby imposing a constructive trust on life insurance proceeds in favor of the estate. The PR challenged the finding that the proceeds of mortgage insurance paid to a bank not named in the suit were not subject to a constructive trust.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1986, the decedent purchased a life insurance policy and named his wife as the beneficiary. In 1987, the decedent purchased mortgage insurance and named a local bank, the mortgagee, as the beneficiary. The decedent and his wife divorced in 1988. The wife received the residential real property and agreed to hold her husband harmless on the debt. The husband died in 1989. The insurer paid the mortgage insurance benefits to the mortgagee. The wife received the life insurance proceeds. Another bank filed an action against the PR to foreclose a mortgage on another piece of property and named the wife in the action. The trial court imposed a constructive trust on the life insurance proceeds because Okla. Stat. art. 15, &sect; 178 (Supp. 1987) provided that a former wife could not be a beneficiary under a policy after her former husband died. The court reversed part of the judgment, affirmed in part, and remanded. The court held that: (1) &sect; 178 was unconstitutional as applied to the wife because it impaired a contract obligation; (2) &sect; 178 only applied to contracts made after its effective date; and (3) &sect; 178 only applied to a former spouse named as a beneficiary, not a mortgagee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment imposing a constructive trust on the life insurance proceeds and remanded that aspect of the case for further proceedings. The court affirmed that part of the trial court's judgment that refused to impose a constructive trust on the mortgage insurance proceeds paid to the mortgagee bank.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, persons claiming an interest in a seized vehicle including defendant who entered a plea of nolo contendere to a charge of burglary in the second degree, challenged the judgment of the District Court of Wagoner County, Oklahoma, which ordered the forfeiture of the car to the state pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1738 (Supp. 1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was observed driving to and entering a house that was not his, and exiting with a videocassette machine. When he saw that he was observed, he returned the machine. He was arrested, and the police confiscated his car. The car was titled in defendant's name, and there were no liens listed on the title. The title was issued in Texas. Defendant' father, mother, grandmother, and attorney, as innocent parties, all claimed interests in the car. Defendant also filed a claim against the car. No security interests were perfected under either Texas law or Oklahoma law. The trial court held that the car was subject to forfeiture. On appeal, the court upheld the constitutionality of the forfeiture statute and held that no claimant's due process rights were violated. It noted that strict compliance was required with regard to Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 1110, the statute for perfecting a security interest in a vehicle. The security interests, if any, held by the various claimants were oral and did not comply with the statute. The State was a third party against whom there was no enforceable security interest. A vehicle used in the commission of a crime was subject to seizure and forfeiture.</SPAN></P>
