</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After allegedly suffering a work-related injury, appellant filed a petition for workers' compensation benefits. The trial court granted appellee's motion to compel appellant to participate in a functional capacity evaluation (FCE) with a physical therapist, which the workers' compensation review board affirmed on appeal. Appellant challenged the review board's decision. The appellate court dismissed appellant's challenge, holding that the trial court order directing appellant to submit to a FCE was not a final order and since appellant's challenge from the trial court to the review court was an appeal from a nonfinal, nonappealable order, the review panel lacked jurisdiction under Neb.

Thus, the trial court did not err in overruling appellant's objection to the guardian ad litem's participation with regard to termination of her parental rights. The argument that &sect; 43-272.01(2)(e) as amended was unconstitutional was not properly raised on appeal. There was clear and convincing evidence to support the order of termination. The court found by clear and convincing evidence that it was in the best interests of the children that the parental rights of appellant be terminated. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators sought a writ of mandamus compelling the respondent, the Lancaster County (Nebraska) district court judge, to grant a jury trial in an action brought against them under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleging a constitutional right to a jury trial under Neb.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators sought a writ of mandamus compelling the respondent, a district court judge, to grant a jury trial in an action brought against them under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court declined to issue the writ because entitlement to a jury trial in a &sect; 1983 action depends on the nature of the underlying action. The essential character of the allegations in the underlying action, that relators denied petitioner proper medical care subjecting him to cruel and unusual punishment, was equitable in nature, despite the petitioner's punitive damages claim. The punitive damages claim was neither compensatory or nominal, nor was it tied to any identifiable damage petitioner allegedly suffered. Neb. Const. art. I, &sect; 6 preserved the right to jury trials in existence at common law and under statutes in force when adopted, denying jury trials in equitable actions and providing them in legal actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Attorney General of the State of Nebraska, appealed the decision of the district court upholding the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 32-1409(1) that provided that signatures on initiative petitions would not be presumed valid unless they matched the voter registration records. The court preliminarily determined whether it had jurisdiction over the appeal by finding which of the district court's orders was final and concluded that the district court's preliminary order was conditional, and thus could not be a final judgment. Accordingly, the appeal was timely filed, and could be heard. The court reversed the district court finding that &sect; 32-1409(1) required an exact match between signature information and voter registration records which did not facilitate the operation of the initiative process, hampered the ability of the public to engage in the initiative process, and did not act to prevent fraud, and accordingly, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's request to take the state bar examination was denied by appellee. The basis of appellee's decision was that appellant lacked the requisite moral character for admission to the state bar under Neb. Ct. R. for Adm. Of Attys. 3 (rev. 1998). In its review of appellant's application, appellee discovered several altercations in which appellant demonstrated an intemperate, hostile and abusive character. Appellant maintained that his conduct was protected by U.S. Const. amend. I and that it did not constitute sufficient cause for denial on the ground of deficient moral character. On review, the court held that an investigation of one's moral character for admission was not a prosecution for conduct protected by U.S. Const. amend. I. Rather, it was in the state's interest to require high standards of qualification, such as good moral character before it admits an applicant to the bar.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of appellant's application because the evidence indicated a propensity on the part of appellant to act in an intemperate, hostile and abusive manner contrary to the moral character expected of attorneys.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court addressed the several errors asserted by defendant.

The appellate court also declined to address issue defendant contended was a plain error, concluding that the alleged error was not an error plainly evident from the record, if an error at all.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). A statute required that the police transmit the results of the chemical tests for blood alcohol of a person convicted of DUI to the department of motor vehicles (DMV). The DMV instituted administrative license revocation proceedings that resulted in revocation of plaintiff's license. The district court affirmed the determination of the DMV. The supreme court affirmed the judgment, holding plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of a sentencing statute in the appeal of the administrative proceeding. Further, the court held that the statute requiring results of the blood alcohol tests to be transmitted to the DMV did not violate the Nebraska constitution's prohibition against special legislation because the statute did not create an unconstitutional classification between those who submit to urine tests and those who submit to blood and breath tests.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of controlled substance violations based on evidence seized during a search of appellant's residence with a warrant. On appeal, appellant asserted that evidence should have been suppressed because the search violated U. S. Const. amend. IV. The court found that the warrant was issued on the basis of an affidavit that was insufficient to establish probable cause. However, the police had submitted another affidavit after the warrant was issued but before the search. When considered with the original affidavit, the second affidavit would have been sufficient to show probable cause, but the judge did not issue a new warrant or amend the previously issued warrant. The court concluded that the judge erred in failing to do so. However, the court concluded that the police acted in objectively reasonable good faith in executing the warrant and, therefore, the seized evidence was admissible. The court affirmed appellant's conviction and overruled State v. Parmar, 437 N.W.2d 503 (1989), and its progeny to the extent they were inconsistent with the test the court set forth for determining whether a police officer acted in good faith in relying on a warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the natural mother of two children, sought reversal of a Separate Juvenile Court of Douglas County (Nebraska) order terminating her parental rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, mother of two children, appealed the termination of her parental rights. Appellant contended that the juvenile court erred in failing to dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction; in failing to dismiss the motion of appellee, the state, to terminate appellant's parental rights because Neb.

Appellant asserted that appellee did not meet its burden of proof and show that appellant's failure to comply with a rehabilitation plan, that termination of her parental rights was in the best interests of the children, and that no reasonable alternative to termination of her parental rights existed. The court affirmed the termination of appellant's parental rights, citing the best interests of the children.

Appellant challenged the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6, 197(10) (Cum.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6, 197(10) (Cum.

The appellate court affirmed appellant's convictions. The court found that appellant did not file a motion to quash or a demurrer. Rather, appellant entered a plea of not guilty, and did not seek leave to withdraw his plea. The court further found that appellant raised his constitutional challenge to the statute at issue as an incident to his motion to suppress rather than as a motion to quash or other approved method for facially challenging the validity of a statute. The court held that a motion to suppress was not an appropriate procedure by which to bring a facial challenge to the constitutional validity of the statute, and that, because appellant entered a plea, he waived any constitutional objections he may have had to the statute. Accordingly, the court would not consider the merits of appellant's constitutional challenge on appeal, and therefore, affirmed the conviction and sentences of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant union was certified as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for road development employees.

Bargaining unit members were subsequently terminated from employment. Appellant filed a petition alleging that appellee knew that the discharged employees were union organizers and adherents and laid them off in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-824(2)(a)-(d). The CIR determined that the employment terminations did not violate section 48-824(2). Appellant sought review. The court found that the CIR did not err in failing to determine the Loudermill issue and that the discharged employees were not entitled to due process procedures because the CBA did not provide them with a property interest in continued employment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant failed to submit to chemical testing, consisting of blood and urine tests, after he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Appellee agency conducted an administrative proceeding and revoked appellant's driving privileges. The trial court affirmed appellee's decision and appellant challenged its determination. Appellant contended that Nev. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 60-6,205 and 60-6,206 to -6,208 were unconstitutional and violated his equal protection rights and that revocation constituted cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that because driving was not a fundamental right and appellant was not a member of a suspect class, there was a rational basis between the aforementioned statutes and a legitimate state interest, in protecting its citizens. Therefore, appellant's equal protection rights were not violated. Additionally, the punishment appellee instituted, revocation of appellant's driver's license, did not reach the level of cruel and unusual punishment. The court upheld revocation of appellant's driver's license accordingly.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, affirming appellee's decision to revoke appellant's driver's license for failure to comply with statutory chemical testing, was affirmed. The court reasoned the applicable statutes did not violate appellant's equal protection rights when a rational basis existed to the legitimate state interests at stake. Moreover, the revocation of appellant's license did not constitute punishment.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff challenged was the vague Nebraska Recreation Liability Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 37-733, 37-734.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, on rehearing to address constitutional arguments, affirmed in part, and reversed in part, a judgment finding that plaintiff, a parent supervisor, was not entitled to recover from defendants, a public school and a club, for injuries she sustained at defendant club's recreational facility. The court held that the exception to the definition of a charge contained in Nebraska's Recreation Liability Act's (Act), Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 37-734, was unconstitutionally vague. The court also held that the sentence containing the rental-paid exception was severable from the rest of the Act. In applying the Act as modified to the present case, the court found that defendant club was not entitled to the protection of the Act because it asked for money in return for an invitation to enter or go upon its land, and that money was not received under a lease to the state for recreational purposes. The case was remanded to reinstate the judgment against defendant club. That part of the judgment finding defendant school not liable was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was granted a writ of habeas corpus based on a constitutional challenge to the state's death penalty procedures. The trial court again sentenced defendant to death. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion for post-conviction relief. Defendant's ex post facto claim and his claims relating to the ineffective assistance of this trial counsel were procedurally barred because these claims had already been litigated. Defendant's claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at resentencing was not procedurally barred but was without merit. Defendant had not shown how he was prejudiced by his counsel's ineffectiveness; defendant had not set forth what evidence he would have presented to rebut either his confession or the narrowed definition of exceptional depravity used by the sentencing panel. Defendant was not subjected to cruel and unusual punishment by virtue of his long confinement on death row. The delay in carrying out the sentence was caused by defendant's availing himself of the procedures that ensured carrying out the sentence would be proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with child neglect. The case was still investigated by appellee, the Nebraska Department of Social Services. Appellant refused to meet with appellee social worker to discuss the allegations of neglect. Based on a police report filed, appellant was identified as a potential child abuser in the Abused or Neglected Children Registry. Appellant sued appellees and an injunction was entered that permanently expunged appellant's name from the Registry. Appellant maintained her suit for damages. The court entered a judgment for appellees. Appellant alleged that her rights were violated under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The court noted that since appellant's petition alleged the violation of a constitutional right, the analysis turned to whether or not that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. Appellee gave notice to appellant before her name was placed in the Registry, was required to find that the claim was supported by the preponderance of the evidence, and proceeded without unreasonable delay. Therefore, the procedures did not violate any clearly established constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The court explained that although the crime was reclassified as a class IIIA felony under a statutory amendment, the amendment was not operative until after every material stage of the judicial process was completed. Thus, the court construed defendant's conviction as a class IV felony. Further, the court found that defendant's sentence was within the applicable statutory framework, explaining that Neb. Rev.

After trial, appellant filed a motion for, among other things, attorney fees. The district court did not rule on this motion before appellant filed its notice of appeal. The court dismissed the appeal holding that until the district court ruled on at least the portion of the motion pertaining to attorney fees, there was no final, appealable order. The court reasoned that an award of attorney fees in a condemnation case was taxed as costs, and costs were considered part of the judgment. Therefore, an award of attorney fees in condemnation cases should also be considered part of the judgment. Because the district court had failed to rule on the motion, part of the judgment had been left unresolved, and, consequently, the order which appellant challenged was not final.

The court disagreed finding that section 60-6,196(8) was harmonious with other sentencing provisions relating to DUI. Moreover, the statute did not impinge on some fundamental constitutional right or create a suspect classification. The legislature did not improperly delegate in placing sentencing alternatives for persons convicted of DUI, first offense, and for persons convicted of DUI who have not been assessed for alcohol abuse, within the judicial branch in general and at the discretion of the sentencing court in particular.

Stat. &sect; 60-6,196 in county court. The county court denied appellant's motion to quash, convicted him, and sentenced him to six months' probation. Appellant challenged the county court's decision in the district court, which affirmed. Appellant filed an appeal of the district court's decision and contended that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6,196 violated the separation of powers clause, Neb. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, and that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6,205 violated the special legislation clause of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18. The court affirmed the district court's affirmance of the county court's decision. The court reasoned Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6,196 did not violate the separation of powers clause because there was no improper delegation and because the statute simply provided sentencing alternatives. Additionally, appellant lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6,205 when the statute had nothing to do with his underlying charge of operating a vehicle while intoxicated, hence, appellant was precluded from attacking an administrative scheme collaterally.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned the district court's affirmation of appellant's conviction was proper because the statute by which appellant was charged did not violate the separations of powers clause and because appellant did not have standing to collaterally challenge the constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, an ordinary citizen, challenged the trial court's denial of injunctive relief in plaintiff's suit to prevent defendant city from selling a municipal hospital to defendant private health care organization. Plaintiff's suit attacked the validity of a city ordinance that was passed to authorize the sale. Plaintiff instigated her suit before the sale was executed; however, by the time it reached the state's highest court, the sale had been finalized. On appeal, the high court held that plaintiff's causes of action seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction were both moot because no justiciable issue existed for which prospective relief was available. The public interest exception to the mootness doctrine did not apply because the circumstances of the case were unlikely to recur and because the nature of the case did not inherently preclude appellate review. The court affirmed the trial court's decision and dismissed the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the claims plaintiff raised on appellate review in seeking a declaratory judgment and an injunction were mooted by the fact that the sale plaintiff sought to prevent had already taken place.

As a result, appellee was notified that his contract might be cancelled, and appellee requested a hearing before appellant board of education. After deliberating on the disputed evidence, appellant determined that appellee's use of physical force out of frustration to strike and restrain the student was in violation of Neb. Rev.

Appellee filed a petition of error in the lower court, which reversed, finding the evidence insufficient to support appellant's decision. Appellant challenged the order and the appellate court reversed and remanded. The appellate court held that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant's findings because striking the student constituted corporal punishment where it inflicted pain as a penalty for the student's behavior. Also, the court ruled that appellee's conduct was unprofessional because inflicting corporal punishment directly related to fitness as a teacher.

The State argued that the center failed to meet the criteria set out in applicable Nebraska statutes and regulations. The instant court concluded that the trial court's finding that the center did not meet its burden in establishing that its proposed facility was the most cost-efficient alternative was supported by the record. The center's proposed multistory design would have required duplication of and provision for certain items that a single-story design would have not required, including multiple nursing stations and an elevator. There was also sufficient competent evidence to support the trial court's finding that the center's project would not have remained financially feasible for the life of its assets.

Defendant claimed that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to file a motion to suppress evidence seized by fire and police officials without warrants at various times after the fire and failed to inform him of the viability of such a motion. The instant court held that defendant's motion alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for postconviction relief and that it could not be determined from the files and records before it that defendant was not entitled to such relief. Defendant's presentence investigation file contained some indication that law enforcement personnel searched defendant's home, took photographs, and seized evidence without a warrant or consent and at a time when defendant may have had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises.

Four of those firefighters also received workers' compensation benefits for injuries they sustained. While they worked for the city, the firefighters contributed approximately seven percent of their gross pay to a pension fund, but unlike firefighters who retired without a disability, disabled firefighters were not allowed to take a lump-sum payment of the amount they contributed when they retired. Moreover, the city reduced the amount of retirement benefits disabled firefighters were paid by the amount of workers' compensation benefits they received. The state supreme court held that (1) the firefighters failed to prove that the city violated their rights by off-setting disability pension payments by the amount of workers' compensation benefits they received; and (2) the city did not violate the disabled firefighters' due process or equal protection rights by utilizing a system that allowed firefighters who were not disabled to take a lump-sum distribution of pension plan contributions while denying that option to disabled firefighters.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state engaged in ex parte communication with the trial judge to negotiate a sentencing agreement for the sole purpose of securing co-defendant's testimony at trial. Danger of judicial bias was remediable by requesting recusal, which defendant did not do. The sentencing agreement did not violate the separation of powers, as it did not bind the trial court, it was part of a legitimate judicial function, and it did not pertain to the prosecution's critical stage. Defendant had no standing to contest the sentence's legality. The state's material failure to provide a copy of the sentencing agreement was not a constitutional violation, as it was provided prior to the trial's end. Defendant did not seek a continuance upon its receipt. The contention that jury selection was tainted and the objections to the jury instructions were rejected. The death sentence was properly imposed because defendant was a major participant in the crime and directly participated in the killing. Finally, it was a violation of the Double Jeopardy clause to have imposed a sentence both for felony murder and the underlying felony offense of burglary. Thus, the court vacated the burglary sentence.</SPAN></P>

The necessary evidence could have been made part of the appellate record had defendant's counsel asked the appellate court to take judicial notice of the transcript from the forfeiture proceeding. Had counsel elected to assert the double jeopardy issue on direct appeal, he could have either requested that relevant portions of the record in the forfeiture proceeding be included in the transcript or requested leave of court to file a supplemental transcript containing such documents. The transcript from the forfeiture proceeding would have provided the court with information regarding the facts that gave rise to the forfeiture of defendant's currency and would have informed the court that those same facts gave rise to defendant's criminal convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The land owner was ordered by LENRD, pursuant to Nebraska's Erosion and Sediment Control Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2-4601 et seq. (Reissue 1987 &amp; Cum. Supp. 1990), to install terraces and construct a sediment and water control basin on his farmland. He argued that the 10-percent cost not borne by the LENRD, the removal from agricultural production of that portion of his land used in the construction, and the consequential diminution in value of the land constituted the taking of land without just compensation. The court concluded there were genuine issues of material fact whether the land owner had been denied economically viable use of his land, due to the conservation measures. Although the one-third diminution in fair market value alone, if true, was insufficient to establish a regulatory taking or damages, the court was unable to determine, as a matter of law, whether the costs imposed precluded a reasonable rate of return on his land or destroyed any distinct investment-backed expectations. However, the court affirmed the decision as to the city because it held that the land owner did not have standing to sue the city on an inverse condemnation theory.</SPAN></P>

The only elements of murder in the second degree were those that the legislature included in &sect; 28-304(1), namely, the causation of death intentionally but without premeditation. An aider and abettor could be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties entered into an agreement whereby the employee would resign his position and relinquish his constitutional rights in exchange for a payment of money from the government employer. The government employer refused to pay the employee and the employee filed an action to recover the payment. The trial court ruled that the agreement was enforceable. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the payment was supported by consideration and was, therefore, not an unconstitutional gratuity. The employee had a legitimate due process claim to a name-clearing hearing. The court also found that the government employer expressly wished not to investigate or provide the employee with a hearing. The court further determined that allegations of sexual involvement with subordinate employees were stigmatizing to an employee whose career required the investigation of sexual harassment claims. The court reasoned that because the government employer received the benefit of the employee's relinquishment of his claim to a name-clearing hearing and he suffered a corresponding detriment, the employee's at-will employment status did not render the agreement without consideration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, among other things, that the trial court erred in finding that there were facts or circumstances in the affidavit in support of the search warrant justifying a nighttime search of his residence. The instant court concluded that because no factual basis existed for the issuance of a warrant authorizing a nighttime search, issuance of the search warrant authorizing entry of the premises &quot;at any time&quot; was in error. The affidavit contained no facts that would have supported an inference that contraband was being disposed of, removed, or hidden in such a manner that nighttime service was required. Because the affidavit was so facially deficient relative to the need for a nighttime search that the executing officers could not have reasonably presumed it to be valid, the good faith exception was not applicable. Thus, the trial court clearly erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant. The instant court also concluded that defendant's custodial statement was obtained as an exploitation of the invalid search and seizure of evidence at his residence, thereby rendering his statement a &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree.&quot;</SPAN></P>

The district court declared the resolution invalid and declared the redevelopment contract void from its inception and rescinded the contract.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trustees contended that the department exceeded its statutory power when it created a separate rate schedule for estates and trusts, because Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-2717 (Reissue 1990), required the department to use one of four rate schedules to tax estates and trusts. As estates and trusts had to be taxed as individuals, the rate schedule that most logically applied to them was the rate schedule for individual taxpayers. The department claimed that &sect; 77-2717 and Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-2715.02 (Supp. 1987) authorized it to refer to the Internal Revenue Code to create a tax-rate schedule for estates and trusts. The Supreme Court of Nebraska disagreed with the trustees' assertion that the department could not adopt the federal rate schedules because &sect; 77-2715.02 referred only to &quot;federal filing status.&quot; That term was sufficiently broad to include the federal rate schedules. As &sect; 77-2717 mandated estates and trusts be taxed as individuals, and &sect; 77-2715.02 directed the department to create a rate schedule in conformity with federal law, it was reasonable to tax estates and trusts pursuant to a special rate schedule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of first degree murder and use of a weapon to commit a felony. In a prior proceeding, the court reversed the convictions and remanded for a new trial. Following a remand, defendant filed motions to dismiss, to withdraw his guilty, to reduce bond, and a plea in bar that asserted a retrial would subject him to double jeopardy. The trial court denied all the motions. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held the time between defendant's original arrest and a reversal of his convictions for prosecutorial misconduct was properly excluded for purposes of speedy trial determination where there was no evidence the misconduct was intended to delay the proceedings or deprive defendant of his right to a speedy trial. The court found a 49-day delay between the reversal order and the retrial was not an unconstitutional delay. The court determined a retrial would not subject defendant to double jeopardy even though defendants' convictions were reversed on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct because defendant did not move for a mistrial during his first trial and there was no evidence the prosecution intended to provoke defendant into moving for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

The District Court for Scotts Bluff County (Nebraska) found that the version of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-118, as amended in 1994, was applicable and equitably apportioned the settlement between appellee and appellants, the employer and its workers' compensation insurer. The employer and insurer appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time of the accident, the Nebraska workers' compensation subrogation statute would have entitled a workers' compensation insurer to a dollar-for-dollar recovery of its subrogation interest. However, by the time proceeds in an employee's product liability case against an equipment manufacturer were to be distributed, the statute had been amended to allow the trial court to make an equitable distribution of the settlement between the employee and the employer or its insurer. The trial court found that a change in the statute granting employers a subrogation interest in actions against third parties, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-118 (Cum. Supp. 1996) was procedural in nature and therefore could be applied, notwithstanding the injury had occurred before the statute had been amended. On appeal, the court held that the application of the law of equity to workers' compensation subrogation to reduce the recovery of the employer/insurer was a substantive change in the law because the employer's and its insurer's substantive right to full recovery of their subrogation interest became vested at the time the accident occurred, prior to the effective date of the amendments to the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over an eight-year period, the litigant filed ninety-nine cases in the district court. In most, if not all, the litigant sought to proceed in forma pauperis. The district court issued an order limiting the number of pleadings which the litigant could file to one per month as long as he was proceeding in forma pauperis and representing himself. Some six years later, the district court returned a pleading to the litigant unfiled, informing him that the pleading could not be filed because he exceeded the district court's limit. The litigant sought a writ of mandamus directing the district court to file his pleading. The court denied the litigant's petition for a writ of mandamus. The court held that the district court's order did not unreasonably restrict the litigant's access to the courts because he was permitted to file more than one in pauperis pleading per month if he showed immediate and extraordinary harm. Therefore, the litigant did not have a clear legal right to have his petition filed despite the district court's order. Finally, Nebraska's interest in not allowing frivolous lawsuits was constitutionally paramount to the litigant's desire to pursue such a course.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the leasing firm had already invoked Neb. Rev.

In affirming, the court held that the Commission properly queried other carriers to learn if their services adequately met the public's needs. The court held that the leasing firm's prior operations were not conducted under color of authority and had no probative value on the issue of public demand or need because they were either tacitly illegal or reflected the operations of the other carrier that the leasing firm with whom the leasing firm had a prior contractual relationship.</SPAN></P>

Supp. 1996) were unconstitutional. The District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska) declared &sect; 32-1409(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The Secretary sought review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Secretary claimed that the lower court erred in ruling &sect; 32-1409(1)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The group president cross-appealed, asserting that the lower court erred in failing to find that the Secretary wrongly determined the number of signatures required and in failing to find that the requisite number of valid signatures had been obtained. The group president also argued that the lower court erred in failing to order the measure placed on the ballot. The court reversed the lower court's judgment and directed that the complaint be dismissed. The court found that the Secretary certified that 10 percent of the registered voters constituted 98,939 voters and determined that 87,488 of the signatures submitted by the group president were valid. The group president submitted no evidence to rehabilitate any of the invalidated signatures. However, in the lower court the group president presented statistical evidence suggesting that between 54.6 percent and 59.5 percent of the rejected signatures were valid. The court held that the issues presented in both the appeal and the cross-appeal had been resolved adversely to the group president in a prior case.</SPAN></P>

The District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska) sustained the counties' demurrers. On appeal, the court reversed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county retirement plan participants sought a declaration that they were entitled to county contributions equal to 250 percent of their contributions, not 150 percent. The court found that Nebraska's County Employees Retirement Act (Act) presented a conflict that required the application of statutory construction rules. The court held that Act instructed the county clerk to pay the primary carrier an amount equal to 250 percent of the deduction, but the sum of the contributions contemplated by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 23-2309 and 23-2310 together equaled 350 percent of the amount deducted. In affirming, the court found that the legislature amended Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-2308 to read &quot;which 250 percent equals the employees' contributions plus the county's contributions of 150 percent of the employees' contributions.&quot; The court held that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 23-2310 was amended so that the word &quot;two&quot; was in each instance changed to &quot;one.&quot; The court held that reading all of the legislature's enactments and amendments required the court to conclude that the legislature never intended the counties to make contributions of 250 percent, but 150 percent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court. The court noted that the district court was exercising its appellate jurisdiction pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-1901 (Reissue 1995). The court determined, however, that there was no statute or court rule that allowed for a rehearing in the district court after the district court had made its ruling subject to &sect; 25-1901. The court found that a motion to reconsider did not toll the time for appeal when a district court was acting as an appellate court. The court concluded that, as a result, the district court's exercise of subject matter jurisdiction over defendant's motion for reconsideration was without statutory authority. The court held that the district court's second order was void. Because a ruling made in the absence of subject matter jurisdiction was a nullity, the court found that it was without jurisdiction to review the merits of the appeal.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect;&sect; 3, 9, were violated; and that his sentence was excessive. The court affirmed. Willful violation of the state securities law did not require knowledge that an item being sold was in fact a security. The right to participate in a multilevel chain distribution gifting program was an investment contract subject to securities regulation, as it involved an investment in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. Case law supplied a definition of an investment contract, so that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The fact that defendant's conduct was prosecutable as a misdemeanor under the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act did not bar prosecution as a felony where the prosecutor's decision was not deliberately based on an unjustifiable standard.

A mobile home park was not one of the permitted uses. The owners applied for a variance in 1992, but they withdrew their application. The trial court found that the owners failed to prove causation and damages. The lower court found that their claim was not ripe and affirmed the trial court. Upon review, the court found that it had to determine whether it had jurisdiction over the action. Because the county had not arrived at a definite position on the owners' application to use their land as a mobile home park or a recreational residential area and the owners failed to show that it would have been futile to apply for a variance, their inverse condemnation action was not ripe for review.

The trial court overruled his motion to quash the information on the basis that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6, 196(8) was facially unconstitutional.

The court found defendant did not have standing to challenge the vagueness of &sect; 60-6, 196 because he drove while under the influence of alcohol, which was clearly proscribed by the statute.

The insured, seeking underinsured motorist coverage, filed petitions for declaratory judgment against the insurers. By answer, denying liability for underinsured coverage and asserting subrogation rights, the insurers asserted that the insured had breached the insurance contracts by settling without their written consent. The court affirmed in part the orders granting summary judgments to the insurers, finding that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 44-3, 128.01 (Reissue 1993), a statute providing for subrogation of medical payments, was constitutional. The court reversed in part on the issue of underinsured benefits, finding that one insurer's policy did not require the insured to exhaust the tortfeasor's liability policy in order to assert a claim for underinsured motorist benefits.</SPAN></P>

The District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska) entered an order which granted summary judgment for the city, state, and system. The participant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The participant's disability pension benefits were reduced by the amount of his workers' compensation benefits. As a result of his social security benefits, the remainder of his pension benefits were eliminated. The participant sought declaratory judgment on behalf of himself and others whose disability pension benefits were or might have been reduced by either workers' compensation, Social Security, or both. The district court granted summary judgment for the city, state, and the system. Upon review, the court held that summary judgment should not have been granted on the participant's claim that a 1989 ordinance constituted an impairment of his contractual right to his benefits because a material question of fact existed as to whether the participant did or could have in fact relied on the city's practice between 1980 and 1989 that, should he have become disabled in the course of his employment, he would have been entitled for a full service-connected disability pension without reduction for workers' compensation. However, the participant could not maintain a class action because a judgment for the participant would not necessarily have bound all members of the purported class.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 79-901 et seq. (Reissue 1996).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administrators of the school retirement system refused to apply two statutory provisions to remove the affected noncertificated employees from the system, and the Nebraska Public Employees Retirement Board notified the attorney general that it would not enforce the provisions of the law so as to deny retirement benefits to the affected noncertificated employees. The attorney general argued that the affected noncertificated employees had contract rights which vested upon enrollment and participation in the system and that application of the Act's provisions to deny participation and retirement benefits would have unconstitutionally interfered with these employees' contract rights. The secretary of state argued that the affected noncertificated employees did not meet the eligibility criteria established for membership and participation in the system. The instant court held that equitable principles required that the affected noncertificated employees be permitted to continue participation in the system. Allowing the State to exclude the affected noncertificated employees from the system after they had made contributions for up to 17 years would have been manifestly unjust.</SPAN></P>

The district court concluded that the taxpayers were actually claiming that an excessive tax was imposed, and because Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-1501 to 77-1513 provided the exclusive remedy, it sustained the commissioner's demurrer and dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction. The court affirmed, holding that the taxpayers had an adequate and exclusive statutory remedy and the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 25-21,149 to 25-21,164 (1995), did not provide relief where another remedy is available. Further, because the taxpayers did not seek to reduce their pending tax liabilities, the court questioned whether the case was justiciable due to the lack of an actual case or controversy. Finally, the court noted that the claim was barred by sovereign immunity because the taxpayer's action against the commissioner did not include claims attacking the constitutionality of the statute or seek relief from an invalid act or abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that defendant's speech was protected under the First Amendment because her speech was not threatening, intimidating, or terrifying.

The court held that the claimant was entitled to have its claim decided by an impartial tribunal and that members of the city council who became witnesses should have recused themselves from the decisionmaking process. The court also held that the requirement of Neb. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The offender filed his petition for writ of mandamus, asking the trial court to compel the Board to consider him eligible for parole. The Board filed its demurrer. The trial court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the petition. On appeal the court reversed because under &sect; 83-1,110(1), a finding of eligibility for parole was not discretionary. Rather, it was the duty of the Board to recognize the offender's parole eligibility upon a showing of certain facts, regardless of the Board's own judgment or opinion concerning the propriety or impropriety of such a determination. Therefore, the Board's duty to recognize the offender's parole eligibility was ministerial. The Board did not have to grant parole, but it had the duty to consider the offender for parole. Given that the offender had no other means for compelling the Board to consider him for parole in accordance with &sect; 83-1,110(1) as it existed at the time of his petition, a writ of mandamus was the appropriate remedy. Because the offender's petition alleged facts sufficient to state a cause of action for a writ of mandamus, the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment by the District Court for Sarpy County (Nebraska) convicting him of attempted first degree assault, discharge of a firearm, use of a firearm to commit a felony, and of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Defendant successfully petitioned to bypass the Court of Appeals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the arraignment, the trial court erroneously informed defendant of the wrong penalties for the crimes he was charged with; the penalties had recently changed. On appeal, defendant asserted that he was improperly arraigned, and as a consequence, he did not intelligently and voluntarily elected to proceed to trial rather than accept the plea bargain offered by the State. The court found that defendant's argument was without merit. The considerations involved in determining whether one freely, intelligently, voluntarily, and understandingly plead guilty had no application because defendant plead not guilty, and therefore did not surrender the constitutional rights inherent in a trial. Defendant additionally claimed that the trial court wrongly treated for purposes of sentencing the attempted assault and discharge crimes as a single offense subject to a single sentence, notwithstanding the separate adjudication of guilt on each of the crimes. The court found that the one offense was not a lesser-included offense of the other, thus, there was no legal basis upon which to impose a single sentence on the two adjudications of guilt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment on the charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm was affirmed. The single sentence imposed for the separate attempted assault and discharge crimes was vacated and set aside, the judgment was otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court found that the definition of &quot;family&quot; in &sect; 27.03.220 did not violate the due process clause of the Nebraska Constitution, because the ordinance and the city's legitimate objectives of promoting community values and a certain quality of living were rationally related, and that defendant did not demonstrate a constitutional defect in the zoning ordinance.

The State had filed its application for leave to docket an appeal on August 20, 1996, when further action, consisting of defendant's sentencing, was necessary to completely dispose of the cause.

The relator alleged that the legislature failed to comply with mandatory constitutional and statutory provisions in adopting the resolutions at issue. The court dismissed the petition. The court held that the mandamus relief sought in the second petition was moot because the ballot issues were already placed on the ballot and the votes were counted, tabulated, and published. Thus, it was impossible to granted the relief requested. The action was filed against the secretary in his official capacity regarding his responsibilities with respect to an election. Such a lawsuit against the secretary was not a civil action in which the state was a party for purposes of establishing original jurisdiction under Neb. Const. art. V, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

The widow cross-appealed a reduction in the amount awarded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurer issued both the insurance policy on the automobile of the widow's husband and the workers' compensation policy for the husband's employer. After the husband was killed in his car during the course of his employment, the widow brought a declaratory judgment action against the insurer. The trial court sustained the widow's motion for summary judgment and the insurer appealed, claiming that under the exclusive remedy provision of the Nebraska Workers' Compensation Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-111 (1993), the widow was not entitled to payments of both the underinsured motorist coverage and the workers' compensation benefits. The court, which transferred the case from the appellate court to its docket, affirmed the trial court judgment. It held that as the underinsured motorist carrier, the insurer was not also the workers' compensation carrier. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-111 protected the insurer only in its role as the workers' compensation carrier, not in its role as the underinsured motorist carrier. Under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-578, however, the widow's underinsured proceeds were correctly reduced by amounts she recovered from the third-party tortfeasor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A victim accused defendant and his companion of sexual assault and kidnapping. Although evidence suggesting an assault was discovered and defendant admitted he had physically assaulted the victim, no charges were filed. Several days later, the victim and two others were found dead. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder, second degree murder, and burglary. The court held that defendant's amended motion to quash the state's operative information was not wrongly overruled because jury unanimity was needed only in finding that defendant committed the murder. Unanimity in determining the theory under which the murder was committed was unnecessary. The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant a new trial. Error occurred when the trial judge did not properly discuss sequestration for jury deliberations and a juror's husband stayed overnight in her hotel room. Defendant was not deprived of a fair trial because the trial judge implicitly found that the husband said nothing significant to the wife. The court ruled that the burglary sentence was error because burglary was a lesser-included offense of felony murder.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that defendant pointed to no evidence indicating how he attempted to comply with the statute. On the contrary, his own testimony established that he intended to keep the vehicles in public view at all times.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The businessman was unhappy with the service he received from the auto dealership and disseminated information regarding its practices. The trial court issued a temporary restraining order precluding the businessman from making statements regarding the auto dealership. The businessman violated the temporary order and was found in contempt. The trial court then vacated the temporary order and issued a permanent injunction. The court found that the businessman's speech was not published in aid of an unlawful act, did not violate the auto dealership's property rights, and did not constitute a breach of trust or contract. The temporary order and permanent injunction thus constituted prior restraints in violation of the businessman's first amendment rights. The businessman's speech did not fall within the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 87-301 et seq., because there was no full and fair adversarial proceeding before a judicial tribunal in which his statements were determined to be false or misleading. The temporary restraining order clearly affected an essential legal right and was final; as the businessman failed to appeal it, he was properly found in contempt.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that (1) the power to remove an employee in the executive branch of state government was an executive prerogative; (2) the ombudsman was an officer of the legislative branch; (3) the language of &sect; 81-2707(1) was mandatory and required the State Personnel Board to follow the ombudsman's findings that a violation of the act occurred; and (4) the requirement that the ombudsman's findings be followed violated the separation of powers clause of Neb.

The district court denied the petition, finding that the minor was not mature and was not capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion, and that it was &quot;not in the best interests&quot; of the minor to have the procedure without prior parental notification.

The court further held that the search warrant, executed and returned within the 10-day limit under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-815 (Reissue 1995), was not stale when executed because the affidavit on which the magistrate relied, recited not only the existence of marijuana, now probably smoked and no longer in the apartment, but also frequent foot traffic, which supplied probable cause to believe that there was drug dealing at the apartment at the time the warrant was executed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Minor children were removed from their mother's home pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-250 and 43-247(3)(a) due to reports of sexual abuse and neglect. The children were placed in the temporary custody of the social services department, pending final disposition. The trial court held a dispositional hearing and approved the recommendation of the department, awarding permanent guardianship to the foster family. The father challenged the judgment of the trial court. On appeal, the court held that the record adequately supported a finding of unfitness as to the father; that the juvenile court had jurisdiction in the case; that the trial court, as required by statute and case law, considered placement with the father and rejected such placement as not in the best interests of the children; and that permanent guardianship was not a de facto termination of parental rights. The father retained his visitation rights and there was no authority given to consent to the adoption of the children. The court also found that the father received notice, an opportunity to be heard, and ample consideration at the hearings. Thus, there was no violation of the father's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The applicant also alleged discrimination against interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court found that the limitation of water exports was not intended merely to protect local economic interests but promoted a legitimate purpose with only incidental burdens on interstate commerce. The court held that the order denying the permit was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable because the agency considered three of the four factors listed in Neb. Rev.

Defendant's petition for a federal writ of habeas corpus was granted and affirmed on appeal. A reduction of the sentences to life imprisonment was ordered unless the state initiated resentencing proceedings. The state filed a motion asking the court for a redefinition of the exceptional depravity component of aggravating circumstances found in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2523(1)(d) (Reissue 1995) and a determination of appropriate sentences. On remand, defendant was resentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed the resentencing. The court adopted the resentencing panel's reformulation of the &quot;cold, calculated planning&quot; aspect of the exceptional depravity component of &sect; 29-2523(1)(d). The court held that the aspect applied to defendant, and thus that aggravating circumstance &sect; 29-2523(1)(d) was present because defendant purposefully selected his victims on the basis of specific characteristics such as race, gender, creed, sexual orientation, disability, or age. The court concluded that the aggravating circumstances proven to exist far outweighed the mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to declare &sect; 28-204&nbsp;unconstitutional, facially and as applied, and failing to grant him a directed verdict or a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant stood mute at his arraignment while the trial court entered a not guilty plea on his behalf, defendant waived his right to challenge the facial validity of &sect; 28-204, under Neb.

Stat. &sect; 28-204 (Reissue 1995) was overbroad, but did not detail how it was overbroad, and issues not raised before the trial court could not be presented on appeal. Defendant claimed that &sect; 28-204 was unconstitutionally vague, but the facts, if believed by the jury, established beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant had the knowledge required of an accessory and that his conduct was clearly prohibited by &sect; 28-204. The trial court's overrule of defendant's motion for a directed verdict was not erroneous because, if believed, the jury could have found that the prosecution had established each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, in part, with regard to first degree murder and for aiding and abetting attempted robbery. The court held that the use of the jury instructions on felony murder was harmless, because the trial court was not barred from permitting the jury to consider defendant's guilt regarding the underlying felony for the sole purpose of determining whether there was sufficient proof of an underlying felony to support the felony murder charge. The court confirmed that the felony murder jury verdict was based upon the conviction for aiding and abetting robbery and was not attributable to any erroneous instructions. The court further found no abuse of discretion as to the denial of defendant's request for change of venue, because the jury was admonished concerning pretrial publicity. The court vacated the trial court's sentence for aiding and abetting as the underlying felony merged into the felony murder conviction.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the fact that the water rights of the constituents of a natural resources district might have been affected by an application to appropriate waters did not confer standing upon the natural resources district to object to the application.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for a municipal court. Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-593(1) transferred municipal court employees to the local county courts. As a result of the transfer, the employee became a State employee and was transferred to the State's employment classification and pay system. Six years after the transfer, the employee filed a contract claim, which alleged that the employee suffered a loss of income because she would receive a smaller contribution to her retirement fund from the State than from the city, lesser insurance benefits, fewer paid non-working days, and that she had to work longer hours. The trial court found that the claim was not filed within the two year statute of limitations set forth in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-8,305(3) (Reissue 1994) and dismissed the claim. The employee claimed on appeal that a new cause of action accrued with each payroll contribution to her retirement fund. The court rejected the employee's claim. The court ruled that the employee's claim stemmed from being transferred to the State's classification and that the claim was not timely filed within two years after the cause of action accrued.</SPAN></P>

The court construed Neb. Rev.

The court held that the district court erred in finding &sect; 47-502 ambiguous and open to construction. The court also found that because incarceration in jail differed so greatly from incarceration in the state prison system in terms of both length of sentence and character, city and county jail inmates were not similarly situated to state prison inmates for the purposes of awarding good time. For this reason, the court held, the provision of good time to city and county jail inmates on an unequal basis with state prison inmates did not violate equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

After his arrest, defendant's suitcase was searched at the jail in order to locate a jacket and a pair of shoes described by the victim. At trial, the victim had claimed that defendant had a slight accent, and defendant was convicted. The appeals court affirmed the conviction and defendant petitioned for further review. The court affirmed the judgment of the appeals court and stated that the jacket seized by the police should have been suppressed by the trial court. The court found that the suitcase that contained the jacket was not the subject of an inventory and no warrant had been obtained. The court held that although the court erred in failing to suppress the jacket, it had not prejudiced defendant and a reversal was not required. The court stated that the jacket was cumulative evidence and the jacket was not being worn by defendant in the photo shown to the victim for identification purposes. The court held that although defendant had a right to present voice exemplar evidence without subjecting himself to cross-examination, such evidence was properly not admitted because it was not reliable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant, a convenience store, sought a liquor license to sell beer. The applicant's sole shareholder had extensive experience in the retail liquor industry and had never been cited for a license violation. The city's council recommended that the commission deny the application. However, after a public hearing, the commission granted the license. The district court affirmed the grant of the license. On appeal, the court held that when amendatory acts, such as 1989 Neb. Laws 781 and 1993 Neb. Laws 183 were invalid, the previous statute on the subject remained in full force and effect. Thus, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-1,116 (Reissue 1984) was the relevant statute, and the district court applied the proper standard of review. Further, the record showed that the commission properly considered the Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-132 (Reissue 1984) factors when determining whether to issue the license. Section 53-132(2)(a)-(c) were satisfied because the applicant had a history of operating licensed premises in a lawful manner. The only factor weighing against the applicant was the council's recommendation. However, that recommendation was based on conclusory and arbitrary claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father first learned of the pregnancy and resulting birth of his son the day after the birth. The father did not file a notice of intent to claim paternity within five days of the birth, as required by &sect;&sect; 43-104.02, 43-104.04, but waited until over a month later. The father argued that &sect;&sect; 43-104.02, 43-104.04 violated his rights of due process and equal protection and that the doctrine of equitable estoppel prevented the termination of his rights. The court disagreed and affirmed. The court held that requiring the father to file a notice of claim of paternity within five days of birth in order to assert rights was substantially related to the state's important interest in protecting the best interests of the child. The father's ignorance of the law was no excuse where the father knew of the birth within the five-day period. The father's procedural due process claim was without merit because he had adequate opportunity to exercise his rights within the filing period. The equitable estoppel claim failed because there was no evidence that the mother intentionally hid her pregnancy or postponed a decision as to the adoption to prevent the father from exercising his rights.</SPAN></P>

The insurer was the employer's workers' compensation insurance carrier. In their actions to recover death benefits, the mothers challenged the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-124, which required the children to prove actual dependency upon their father, the deceased employee. After consolidation, the trial court held &sect; 48-124 was unconstitutional and entered the judgment against the insurer and the employer. On appeal, they claimed that the trial court erred in finding that the disparate treatment of children born out of wedlock was unconstitutional and that the minors were entitled to the conclusive presumption of dependency under &sect; 48-124(3). The court affirmed the judgment because the disparate treatment of children born in and out of wedlock by &sect; 48-124(3) impermissibly discriminated against children born out of wedlock by requiring those children to assume a heavier burden of proof concerning their dependency than that required of children born in wedlock.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant asserted that the notice served upon him was inadequate. The court reversed. It noted that while the county weed control superintendent testified that he was required to notify a landowner of his findings, the record did not indicate who required the superintendent to give such notice. The record was absent of any showing that the control authority delegated its statutory duty to make findings and to issue notice to the superintendent. The court noted that it was a fundamental principle of statutory construction that penal statutes were to be strictly construed. As a result, the court concluded that defendant was prejudiced by the State's failure to prove an element of the crime charged, that defendant was served proper notice after a finding of uncontrolled noxious weeds by the control authority or by the superintendent as expressly required by the control authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused, a motorcycle dealer, caused one of his employees to switch odometers on two motorcycles. No notice required by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-133 was attached to the registration certificate of either motorcycle by the accused because neither of the motorcycles had been registered. The State's information against the accused for odometer fraud was dismissed. On appeal, the court held that the accused's claimed denial of equal protection arose because under &sect; 60-133, the notice was to be affixed on the left doorframe of motor vehicles other than motorcycles, but in the case of motorcycles, it was to be affixed to the registration certificate. The court found that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-106(7) exempted motor vehicle dealers from obtaining certificates of title that, under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-302(1), became the applications for the certificates of registration for vehicles operated or parked on state highways. Yet, the only means by which motorcycle dealers could comply with &sect; 60-133 was to register motorcycles irrespective of whether they were being operated or parked on state highways. The court found, therefore, that &sect;&sect; 60-132 and 60-133 violated the Equal Protection Clause.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the purpose of ALR proceedings were to protect the public and to deter others from driving drunk, such that ALR proceedings could not have resulted in punishment for double jeopardy purposes.

L.B. 507 required future legislation projected to increase total inmate population in state correctional facilities to include certain cost-estimate provisions in the legislation and required that a separate appropriations bill be enacted in the same legislative session. Relator maintained that L.B. 507 was unconstitutional and that the Legislature repealed L.B. 507 by implication. The court gave judgment for relator because the Legislature could legislate upon any subject not inhibited by the Constitution, and if the court were called upon to enforce the provisions of L.B. 507 against legislation enacted by a subsequent legislature, it would not have the authority to do so. The state Constitution was not a grant, but a restriction of legislative power. Consequently, courts could enforce only those limitations which the Constitution imposed. L.B. 507 was thus unconstitutional in its entirety.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer complained that the tax was an unlawful commutation of property tax, that it resulted in a nonuniform assessment, that it taxed property for state purposes, and that it was a special law for the benefit of a certain classes. The court denied the taxpayer's request for declaratory and injunctive relief, concluding that 1993 Neb. Laws 839 did not unlawfully commutate taxes by diverting funds raised in one tax district for the benefit of another. That was so despite the fact that the legislature did not create an elective body to oversee the levying process. The tax was also uniformly levied based on property value within the given tax district, which encompassed several school districts. Moreover, the tax was levied for substantially local purposes because the state neither controlled the financial support given to certain districts nor condition receipt of state funds. Finally, the tax neither created an arbitrary and unreasonable method of classifying taxpayers nor taxed without representation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, Nebraska Commissioner of Labor (commissioner), sought review of the decision of the District Court for Douglas County (Nebraska), which reversed the commissioner's decision and held that all carpenters utilized by appellee contractor between certain dates were independent contractors, and, as such, the contractor was not liable for unemployment insurance contributions for those carpenters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractor treated some of its engaged carpenters as employees while others, like appellee claimant, were treated as independent contractors. The great majority of the contractor's business was conducted at various job sites. Each independent contractor carpenter supplied his own vehicle and tools and was not paid expenses. Following an investigation, the commissioner found that certain carpenters utilized by the contractor were employees, and, therefore, the contractor was liable for unemployment insurance contributions for those employees. The district court reversed the commissioner's decision. On appeal, the court reversed the district court's decision. The court held that the district court had jurisdiction to hear the contractor's petition for review because the first adjudicated hearing was held in the same county where the court was located. The court noted the precedential value of court of appeals case law and disapproved a case on which the commissioner had relied. Finally, the district court's conclusion, that all carpenters employed during a certain period were independent contractors, was in error and was not supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the district court, which reversed the commissioner's decision that the carpenters utilized by the contractor were the contractor's employees, and, therefore, the contractor was liable for unemployment insurance contributions. The cause was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the District Court, Douglas County (Nebraska), which affirmed the denial of his application, pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6, 209 (Reissue 1993), for reduction to time served of a 15 year revocation of his driver's license. The district court affirmed a county court's finding that &sect; 60-6, 209 violated the separation of powers clause in Neb. Const. art. II, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced on a charge of driving while intoxicated. He filed an application to have his license revocation reduced to time served pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-6, 209 (Reissue 1993), and claimed the district court erred in finding that &sect; 60-6, 209 was unconstitutional as a violation of the separation of powers clause. The court affirmed. The power to commute sentences was entrusted in an executive department board known as the Board of Pardons. In order for &sect; 60-6, 209 to invade the Board's power to commute sentences and therefore violate the separation of powers clause, the purpose behind the 15 year license revocation had to be one of punishment rather than remedial. The 15- year revocation of a driver's license was punishment. Therefore, &sect; 60-6, 209 was unconstitutional because it permitted a judicial commutation of a sentence of punishment. Pursuant to &sect; 60-6, 209 a trial court had the power to substitute a milder punishment for a sentence that had already been imposed, which would permit a judicial branch to exercise a power which clearly belonged to the executive branch. It was, therefore, unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction on the ground that the trial court had erred in failing to include malice as an essential element of the crime. The court reversed and remanded defendant's conviction. The court determined that penal statutes were to be strictly construed, and that the court should not supply missing words or sentences. However, a state's highest court could put words in a statute as if it had been so amended by the legislature. When a statute was susceptible of two constructions, one unconstitutional and one constitutional, the court was to adopt the construction resulting in validity. Without the element of malice, &sect; 28-304(1) was of doubtful validity and perhaps unconstitutional. Therefore, the court held that malice was a necessary element of second degree murder under &sect; 28-304(1). The omission of malice as a material element was plain error and prejudicial, and the court had jurisdiction because the sentence entered by the trial court was invalid due to plain error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state previously filed an action against defendant, alleging that her solicitation of funds for a celebration during the dedication of a city hall building, from people outside the county, violated Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1445 (Reissue 1989). Defendant filed a plea in abatement and a motion to quash, and the state demurred to both motions. The county court sustained the state's demurrer with regard to the plea in abatement, but eventually sustained the motion to quash, which challenged Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 28-1440 to 28-1446 (Reissue 1989) on the grounds that the statutes were vague and overbroad and that they had a chilling effect on First Amendment rights. The district court affirmed the county court's judgment. The court affirmed, holding that &sect;&sect; 28-1440 to 28-1446 were unconstitutional because they contained prior restraints on free speech. The court held that the statutes, which required charitable solicitors to obtain a certificate from the county before soliciting, placed no limitation on the exercise of the county attorney's discretion in issuing the certificates, and therefore provided a grave danger of suppressing protected speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While working as a refuse hauler for the employer, the employee sustained an injury to his leg and back. After receiving medical treatment, all but one of the employee's attending physicians expressed opinions that the employee did not suffer from a permanent disability. One doctor stated that the employee suffered permanency attributable to the accident because a disk tear was reported on an MRI scan that was indicative of an acute injury. The employee returned to light duty, but was unable to perform that job. The employee attempted to return a second time, but at some point after that, the employee was terminated. The employee was granted an award that he maintained was inadequate. The court determined that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 48-185 (Reissue 1993) precluded it from substituting its view of the facts for that of the Compensation Court because substantial evidence substantiated the Compensation Court's factual conclusions. There was no error in the Compensation Court's decision to believe one of treating physicians over the others.

The driver, a public school system employee, argued that because he was performing activities within the scope of his employment, the action was subject to the Political Subdivisions Tort Claims Act (Act), Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-901 et seq., and that the statute of limitations had run on the action. After a jury verdict was rendered in favor of the driver, the district court dismissed the father's petition. The father and driver both appealed and the court affirmed the district court's decision, holding that the Act applied because the evidence was sufficient to determine that the driver was acting within the scope of his employment. The court also found that the Act was constitutional, holding that qualified immunity from tort liability to an employee of a political subdivision did not violate equal protection principles because the Act imposed employee liability for tort damages proximately caused by the employee's acts or omissions which were outside the scope of employment or which were wanton, malicious, or in bad faith.</SPAN></P>

The court held (1) the corporation's request for disqualification of counsel was untimely because the corporation failed to raise the issue below or seek such relief through a writ of mandamus, (2) the department acted within its authority under the Act when it restricted the corporation's ability to dispose of the stock, (3) the department's order was shielded from a Commerce Clause attack under the provisions of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1011 et seq., because the order related to &quot;the business of insurance,&quot; and (4) the order did not unduly burden interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision of the district court, denied the corporation's request for disqualification of the insurance company's counsel, and denied the corporation's request that it be granted a new hearing on the acquisition application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court held that the zoning ordinance was unconstitutional, void, and ineffective as to the conduct of the convenience store's business. Appeal was taken. The court held that the convenience store carried its initial burden and showed the existence of a legislative classification and disparate treatment of those within the class of businesses known as dual business operators. Moreover, the court held that the convenience store owner also established that the city's zoning ordinance, distinguished between members of this class, specifically between dual business operators with off-sale liquor licenses and those with on-sale liquor licenses. The court further held that the city did not present evidence that would allow the court to find sufficient justification for the city's disparate treatment of dual business operators such as the convenience store, and for the differing treatment, which bore no reasonable relationship to the city's policies set in its zoning code. Therefore, inasmuch as the city clearly sought to do through its zoning ordinance what it had been told it could not do with its liquor licensing standards ordinance, it was held to be unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant husband appealed the order entered by the District Court for York County (Nebraska), granting plaintiff wife's summons in garnishment to collect $ 500 in spousal support from the husband's Social Security benefits. The district court overruled the husband's objections thatbhe did not owe the amount sought to be garnished and that the county attorney did not have statutory authority to represent the wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When he became unemployed while supporting three minor stepchildren, the husband contested the wife's application for $ 500 a month from his monthly Social Security benefits of $ 741 per month. On appeal, he claimed that the district court erred in not limiting the amount garnished from his Social Security benefits to 15 percent as required by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-1558, unless used in support of a person, and in overruling his motion to disqualify the county attorney's office from representing the wife. Finding the husband correct in his assertion that &quot;spousal support&quot; meant support paid to a spouse in an order for child support, the court nevertheless affirmed the deduction at a rate greater than 15 percent because the term &quot;spousal support&quot; was properly interpreted as alimony, which also constituted support of a person. However, the Consumer Credit Protection Act limited garnishments to 50 percent and 5 percent for arrearages, and $ 500 exceeded 55 percent of the husband's $ 741 benefits. Thus, the court remanded for a recalculation of benefits, but otherwise affirmed the rulings below. Further, the husband was not prejudiced by the county attorney's representation of the wife.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court's order and remanded the cause for a recalculation of the garnished amount, but otherwise affirmed the district court's findings.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 66-1326 and 66-1329 (Cum. Supp. 1992) were in violation of Neb. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3. The act required the Nebraska Department of Revenue to adopt and promulgate rules and regulations to provide for the issuance of transferable motor fuel tax credit certificates to ethanol producers in Nebraska and to enter into agreements with ethanol producers on behalf of the State of Nebraska to furnish tax credits to producers as mandated by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 66-1344. The court examined &sect; 66-1344 to determine whether it involved a credit of the state which was given or loaned to ethanol producers. The key question was whether the state acted as a debtor by extending the state's credit to private corporations, associations, or individuals. The court found that although the amount of motor fuel taxes collected by the state was reduced by the ethanol tax credit program, the state was not placed in the position of a debtor. The tax credit was used to offset a debt owing to the state and the credit of the state was not involved.</SPAN></P>

The district court ordered the return of all funds collected pursuant to the ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinances were apparently enacted after the city's solid waste disposal area was found to have contaminated ground water and federal regulations required the closing of the landfill. The ordinances imposed a management fee in connection with the use of the solid waste area. The resident alleged that there was no statutory authority for the imposition of the management fee and that the management fee violated the equal protection provisions of the Nebraska and U.S. Constitutions. On appeal from a judgment in favor of the resident, the court discovered a procedural omission on the part of the resident, which obviated the need to address the assigned errors. The court found that having alleged that the ordinances in question were unconstitutional, the resident was obligated pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-21,159 (Reissue 1989) to serve the attorney general with a copy of the proceeding. Because the resident failed to observe that statutory prerequisite to the exercise of the district court's subject matter jurisdiction, the action was ordered dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The poverty affidavit had to assert that defendant was unable by reason of poverty to pay the costs of the appeal in order to vest jurisdiction with the court. The inadequate affidavit did not waive the mandatory docket fee or vest jurisdiction. A second affidavit was offered at the hearing on the motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and was not filed in the office of the clerk of the district court along with the notice of appeal, as required by statute.

Specifically, the automobile manufacturer argued that the hearing provisions of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 60-1420 to -1435 (Reissue 1993) were contrary to the due process guarantees. The automobile manufacture sought to terminate a franchise with the automobile dealer.  Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-1420 provided that the franchise could not be terminated unless the automobile manufacturer established at a hearing before the board that there was good cause for the termination. The automobile manufacturer argued that the composition of the board favored automobile dealers and prevented it from acting as a neutral decisionmaker in a dealer termination. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment for the board and the automobile dealer, finding that the automobile manufacturer failed to meet its burden of establishing that &sect; 60-1420 was unconstitutional and that the membership of several automobile dealers on the motor vehicle board did not deprive the automobile manufacturer of due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Department of Revenue demanded payment of motor vehicle fuel taxes from the taxpayers as corporate officers liable for payment under &sect; 77-1783, and refused to grant a formal hearing on the tax liability until the tax, penalty, and interest was paid in full, or a bond was posted to cover the outstanding liability. The taxpayers claimed that they were not financially able to pay the tax, or post a bond for the tax, and that it was unconstitutional to require payment as a precondition to a hearing. The court found that the district court correctly determined that it could not grant injunctive relief because the taxpayers' right to seek an injunction was expressly prohibited by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 77-1727, 77-3908. The court also found that a declaratory judgment action was an appropriate method to challenge the constitutionality of the tax statute and that the district court had authority to hear the action for declaratory judgment. The court reversed the dismissal because due process required that the taxpayers who were financially encumbered should have been given an opportunity for judicial review of the assessment prior to payment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the commutation of a sentence was a power entrusted to the executive branch of the state government under Neb. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13. Neb. Const.&nbsp;art.

The company argued that the district court erred in ruling that it was a &quot;retailer,&quot; instead of a &quot;contractor,&quot; under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 77-2702.05 and 77-2702.13.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company, a landscaping partnership, subcontracted with building contractors to cultivate sod, trees, and flowers into homeowners' land. Its primary customers were general building contractors. It did not pay a sales tax on the sod it bought from its supplier. After the Department conducted an audit, it determined that the company owed sales and use taxes. The Department contended that the company was a &quot;retailer&quot; because its business consisted of selling live plants incorporated into real estate. The company claimed it was a &quot;contractor&quot; because its sales of live plants incorporated into real estate were incidental to the transfer of an improvement upon real estate. On appeal, the court held that under &sect;&sect; 77-2702.05 and 77-2702.13, a contractor, like the company, which incorporated live plants, including sod, into real estate was a &quot;retailer&quot; for tax purposes. The statutory exception from the definition of &quot;retail sale&quot; for persons who conducted sales of live plants incorporated into real estate incidental to the transfer of an improvement upon the real estate was limited to general building contractors who performed landscaping services incidental to other home improvements.</SPAN></P>

The supplemental benefit plan constituted a pension rather than a mere gratuity for the purposes of the contract clause of the U.S. Constitution, and the firefighters' constitutionally protected rights in that pension vested when they accepted employment with the city and became members in the plan. Because the city's elimination of the supplemental benefit was neither necessary nor a reasonable alteration of the plaintiffs' pension rights, the city violated the plaintiffs' and the class' rights under the contract clause of the U.S. Constitution, in violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.The city clearly impaired that contract by eliminating the plan.</SPAN></P>

The city council then denied the long-form application. Affirming, the court ruled that the district court correctly found that the city council was trying to revoke or cancel the liquor license under the guise of taking action on renewal of the license.

Stat. &sect; 25-1241 (Reissue 1989), that the notary had commission from another state and no authority outside his state, pursuant to Iowa Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 9E.10, 9E.11 (1994), that the affidavit was void, and that the poverty affidavit substituted for the docket fee pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-103 (Reissue 1993), and that when defendant failed to file within the time required for a docket fee the court acquired no jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The action was brought by appellees, municipal corporations and taxpayers, for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The municipal corporations were cities and villages located in counties with licensed horse racetracks and licensed lotteries; the individuals were taxpayers and property owners. The trial court found that the Act imposed an additional tax in addition to the tax imposed by Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9-648 and therefore violated Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18. The trial court also held that the Act violated constitutional guarantees of equal protection. First, the court held the taxpayers, not the municipalities, had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Act because they were seeking to enjoin the expenditure of public funds. The court held that the Act was clearly a lottery regulation provision, subject to the general gambling ban exceptions found in Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 24. Requiring two percent of the gross proceeds from certain lotteries to be credited to the horseracing industry was not for charitable or community betterment purposes and was unconstitutional. The court also held that the Act did not constitute special legislation under art. III, &sect; 18. The court did not address the equal protection argument.</SPAN></P>

On its property, the owner placed a billboard which contained advertisements for a soft drink and pure water. Section 39-1320.06 prohibited the billboard because it was visible from the interstate highway, and the federal government provided additional highway funds to the State if it regulated off-premises signs. The lower court ordered the owner to remove the contents from the billboards and enjoined the owner from placing any billboard on its property that violated State law. The court affirmed, holding that the billboard was an off-premises sign and was subject to &sect; 39-1320.06. The court ruled that permitting on-premises signs, which identified the business in a building, while prohibiting off-premises signs, which advertised businesses not in a building, did not violate Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18 because the classification of the signs bore a rational relationship to public health and safety.

Stat. &sect; 77-4312(4) (1994), which required payment of an unpaid marijuana and controlled substances tax or the posting of security as a prerequisite to a hearing on the redetermination of such tax, violated due process as applied to appellee indigents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department issued a notice of jeopardy determination and assessment for unpaid marijuana and controlled substances tax against the indigents in the amount of $ 18,800, plus an $ 18,800 penalty. The notice stated that it would become final unless a petition for redetermination, along with security in the amount of $ 18,800, was filed with the Tax Commissioner. The indigents filed their petition for redetermination and requested a hearing. A hearing officer determined that the Commissioner was without the authority to hear the merits of the petition because the indigents failed to file their security. The district court remanded the case to the Department for further proceedings on the petition for redetermination. In affirming the order, the court ruled that &sect; 77-4312(4), as it applied to indigents, was unconstitutional. The indigents' due process right to a redetermination hearing was improperly conditioned on requirements so harsh as to effectively deny them access to the courts. The statute was also an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to an administrative officer because it did not set forth definite standards for what constituted a suitable security.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, through its Attorney General, brought an original action in quo warranto to oust respondent, a duly qualified judge, from membership on the Nebraska Commission on Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice (commission). The State alleged that the judge's dual service as a judge and member of the commission violated the distribution of powers clause in Neb. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. The judge counterclaimed for an attorney fee and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State brought an action in quo warranto to oust the judge from his membership on the commission. The statute establishing the commission specified that a judge be appointed to the commission. The commission was an agency of the executive branch, having been formed to assist with the administration of law and to prepare and adopt comprehensive law enforcement plans in order to receive federal funds for their programs. The court found that quo warranto was the proper means of testing whether the judge's membership on the commission was constitutionally proper, membership on the commission constituting a &quot;public office&quot; under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-21,121. The court then held that commission was an executive agency and that the provision of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 81-1417, which specified that the membership of the commission include a judge, violated the distribution of powers clause, Neb. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, but that the provision was severable from the remainder of the statute. The court, however, granted the judge's counterclaim for an attorney fee and costs under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24.204.01 because the action was brought by a real party in interest and raised justiciable issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered, adjudged, and decreed that the judge be ousted, removed, and excluded from membership on the commission and that he be awarded costs and a reasonable attorney fee.</SPAN></P>

The court, holding that the board did not have jurisdiction to consider equalization of the company's property, dismissed the appeal and remanded. The court noted that because the company referred only to centrally assessed property in its protest to the board, the record did not establish that only locally assessed property was to be considered. Although the company failed to differentiate between locally assessed property and centrally assessed property in its protest, however, the outcome would have been no different if such a differentiation had been made. Because the board had no authority to equalize the company's property with property that was exempt from taxation, the company's remedy did not involve equalization, and the board could not equalize the value of the company's property to zero. The board had no jurisdiction to grant the relief requested and when an administrative agency lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a claim, the courts lacked such jurisdiction on appeal.</SPAN></P>

Despite the driver's argument to the contrary, the court held that the Act complied with the notice and hearing requirements of the federal and state Constitutions and the driver's due process rights had not been violated. The court further held that the district court was correct in placing the burden of proof on her as opposed to the State. The court reasoned that the driver had the burden of proving the invalidity of the department's order. The court further held that the district court did not err in refusing to fashion an equitable remedy in the suit because there was an adequate remedy for the driver at law.

III, &sect; 24 provided that parimutuel wagering was authorized as long as it was conducted by licensees within a licensed racetrack.

Stat. &sect; 28-1213 (Reissue 1989), was unconstitutionally vague, and there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence showed that defendant and his companions used Molotov cocktails, constructed of jars and gasoline, to light fires at various locations. Section 28-1213 specifically included a Molotov cocktail in the definition of destructive devices, and it excluded any device that the State Patrol found was not likely to be used as a weapon or was an antique. Defendant argued the statute improperly delegated legislative authority to the State Patrol, and he also cited testimony that the jars were just Halloween pranks, to support his claim that there was insufficient evidence of intent to use them as weapons. On appeal, the court held that (1) defendant could not argue vagueness in the abstract, and his conduct clearly was prohibited by the statute; (2) a deputy State Fire Marshal testified that the jars fit the definition of a Molotov cocktail, the purpose of which was to do harm to individuals or damage to property, and this was sufficient to show intent; and (3) the jury's finding that defendant intended to use the jars as weapons against property were supported by relevant evidence, so they were not set aside.</SPAN></P>

The appeal was also filed three days prior to the entry of judgment was filed. The court reversed and remanded defendant's conviction. The court first held that defendant's appeal was early as it was filed prior to the time that the entry of judgment was filed. However, where there was an announced decision, a notice of appeal showing on its face that it related to the announced decision, and a judgment conforming to the announced decision, the early appeal was not defective. The court then declined to consider the constitutionality challenge as defendant failed to comply with Neb. Ct. R. of Prac. 9E (Rev. 1992).

On appeal, the court determined that the sentences were not excessive. The district court then set a hearing under the resentencing statute,&nbsp;Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2308.01 (Reissue 1989). The State challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The district court determined that the resentencing statute was unconstitutional. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

IV, &sect; 13, to an executive department board consisting of the Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State, commonly known as the Board of Pardons. The court agreed and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2308.01 (Reissue 1989) was unconstitutional and, therefore, unenforceable, because it purported to grant commutation power to the judiciary, in violation of Neb. Const. art. IV, &sect; 13, which entrusted such power to the Board of Pardons.The court reasoned that an appellate court, which modified a sentence on review, which was demonstrated to constitute an abuse of discretion, operated within the confines of an unconcluded judicial process. In contrast, the court said, a sentencing court, which choses to substitute a milder punishment for the sentence it had originally imposed did the very thing, which defined an act of commutation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife alleged that the doctor's negligence was the direct and proximate cause of her breast cancer.

The court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed in part. The court held that because the wife brought her action approximately 20 years after the effective date of the statute, her action was untimely as the outer limits of a reasonable time for bringing a suit was the longest repose period set forth in the 10-year repose statute. However, the court did allow the wife and the husband individually the opportunity to amend the complaints to establish that the doctor fraudulently concealed a material fact, that the fraudulent concealment prevented her from bringing the action within the confines of &sect; 25-222, and that she brought the action within a reasonable time after discovery of the fraudulent concealment under an equitable estoppel theory.</SPAN></P>

Laws, L.B. 657, which authorized the appropriation of tax dollars to reimburse the creditors of a failed savings company. The taxpayer sought permanent injunctive relief and requested an award of attorney fees and costs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Nebraska Department of Banking and Finance closed the savings company, which surrendered all of its assets to a receiver and thereafter had no assets to fulfill its guarantees of deposits. The company's creditors brought various actions against it, and a compromise amount was approved for payment of the creditors' tort claim against the State. The State Legislature appropriated the amount for payment to the receiver, which executed a release of all claims against the State arising out of the company's collapse. A second appropriation was approved by the Legislature under 1993 Neb. Laws, L.B. 657 for payment of miscellaneous items of indebtedness, and the taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of L.B. 657. The court held that L.B. 657 was special legislation in violation of Neb. Const. art. III, &sect; 18 because it created an arbitrary and unreasonable method of classification and a permanently closed class, and thus, it was unconstitutional. The court concluded that taxpayer was entitled to attorney fees and expenses under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-204.01 (Reissue 1989) because the Attorney General had made no ruling on the constitutionality of L.B. 657.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of first degree sexual assault of a child and was sentenced to five years' intensively supervised probation, 100 days of electronic monitoring, and 90 served. The State appealed the sentence as excessively lenient. On appeal, the court held that defendant was convicted of first degree sexual assault on a child, which was a Class II felony punishable by a maximum of 50 years' imprisonment and a minimum of one years' imprisonment under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-319(1)(c) (Reissue 1989). The court determined that there was a risk that during a period of probation defendant would engage in additional criminal conduct as an evaluation of defendant indicated that he had somewhat less than average compliance to social expectations. The offense for which defendant was convicted followed a lengthy history of other sexual assaults upon the victim including violence and the court found that the sentence of probation was excessively lenient and the trial court abused its discretion in granting probation. The court vacated the order and sentenced defendant to a term of not less than six nor more than eight years.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the judgments of the Court of Appeals. The court held that even assuming that the taxpayers' theory of recovery, that because exemptions granted to certain taxpayers violated the uniformity clause of the Nebraska Constitution, article VIII, &sect; 1, and the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, they were not entitled to a full refund. Instead, they were entitled, at most, to a refund of the difference between the taxes levied against them and the taxes which would have been due had all the property treated as exempt had been placed on the rolls and taxed. Because they failed to show the amount of the refund they were entitled to, the district court should have denied their claim.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the appellate court because 1) the restrictive covenants did not authorize changes by a majority of the landowners until 1995, 2) although a majority could adopt changes to the original covenants, a majority did not have the authority to adopt new and different covenants which restricted the use of the land, 3) there were no prior setback restrictions so the amendment was a new restrictive covenant, and 4) the minority landowners were not estopped from asserting their right to challenge the validity of the disputed covenant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A prison inmate was sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree murder, with a concurrent sentence of 15 to 50 years for shooting to kill or maim. The inmate challenged the Department of Correction's denial of his request for promotion to minimum custody. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of the Department. The court held that the automatic three-year waiting period that was imposed against the inmate before he was eligible for a custody change under the adult inmate classification manual did not violate the inmate's right to due process and equal protection under the U.S. and Nebraska Constitutions. The inmate had no inherent due process right to have his security level downgraded. Moreover, the regulations did not create a protectible expectation of custody promotion. Therefore, the court found no merit in the inmate's assertion that he had been entitled to a hearing. Finally, the trial court did not receive evidence or rule on the issue of the promulgation of the adult inmate classification system and, therefore, the issue was not properly presented for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial judge had sustained the demurrer to the petition for declaratory relief for: (1) lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction; (2) defect or misjoinder of parties; (3) improper joinder of several causes of action; and (4) the petition's failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. On appeal, the court initially found that public employee's substitution as a party was proper as he bore the same relationship to the dispute as his predecessor. The court then held that none of the asserted bases for a demurrer were sustainable under the record. The court noted that counties were not immune from suit, as sovereign immunity was legislatively waived regarding suits over contract disputes. The further noted that the failure to name the retirement board, a dispensable party, as a defendant did not constitute a defect in joinder. The court concluded by finding that public employee had stated a cause of action on his own individual behalf and on behalf of the class, noting that the fact that public employee asked for relief which might have included a money judgment did not mean that he had failed to state a claim for declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant firefighters sought review of the judgment of the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska), which dismissed their claims against appellee city, in which the firefighters claimed they were entitled to a lump-sum return of their pension plan contributions. The firefighters also alleged that withholding of their contribution and deduction of other amounts violated their constitutional rights, in contravention of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After six firefighters began receiving compensation from the city pension plan, they filed claims with the city to recover their lump-sum contribution to the plan. The city denied their claims and the firefighters sought judicial review. The trial court dismissed their claims. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that claims against the city were required to be filed with the city within one year of the date of accrual, and found further that the cause of action for the lump-sum distribution accrued on the date of employment termination. The court reversed as to one firefighter the dismissal of his claim that the city had improperly deducted worker compensation benefits from his pension check, holding that such claim accrued on the date of each installment from which the city made these deductions. The court held, however, that statutes that required that claims against a city be filed with the city as a condition precedent to maintaining an action were impermissible limitations on a party's right to bring an action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, and held that the firefighters' claims could be brought pursuant to &sect; 1983, which was governed by a four year statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of the claims for return of the firefighters' contribution to the pension plan under state law, but held that this claim, together with the claim of three firefighters that the state had improperly deducted worker compensation benefits from their pension checks, could be brought as an action alleging violation of the firefighters civil rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State petitioned for a review of the decision of the Nebraska Court of Appeals, which vacated defendant's conviction for criminal mischief and vacated his sentence of 10 years' imprisonment after he was found to be have been a habitual criminal. Defendant had refused to accept a plea bargain offered by the State and was charged, after a jury trial, with violating Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-519, and Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 29-2221, respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence. The court held that, despite the fact that there was no direct testimony of ownership of the property damaged in the jail, the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. The specific ownership of property was not an essential element of criminal mischief and was immaterial except to identify the property in question as not being that of the accused. The court noted that the amount of pecuniary loss, though not an element of the offense, was determinative of the grade of the offense and the punishment that might have been imposed. Thus, the testimony of the project manager for one of the contractors who helped build the jail, coupled with the vice president of the electrical contractor of the jail as to estimates to repair the damage caused by defendant, supported the jury's finding concerning the pecuniary loss caused. Finally, the court held that the State was within its rights to add the habitual criminal offender charges and did not act vindictive in doing so because defendant was informed during plea bargaining that the charges would be added to all of his pending four felonies if he rejected the State's offer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected each of the property owners' arguments on appeal and affirmed the judgment against them. The trial court's ruling that denied class certification was not reviewed because the amended petition omitted any reference to a class action. It was not erroneous for the trial court to refuse to consider the constitutionality of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 21-1914 which permitted the association to restrict voting privileges of its members who were not in good standing. The reason being that the property owners failed to serve the attorney general with a copy of the proceeding pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-21, 159 (Reissue 1989). The property owners' claim that the election of the directors was invalid was not considered because it was not preserved for review when it was not presented before the trial court. Next, the association could restrict its members from voting if they were delinquent in their dues because Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 21-1914 of the Nonprofit Corporation Act specifically provided that members' voting rights were subject to an association's bylaws, and the association's bylaws explicitly limited voting to members whose dues were current.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court dismissed as moot the injunction appeal and affirmed the judgment in favor of URNRD. The court held that the issue of whether the ground water supply was insufficient for all water users was determined when the area was deemed a control area. Thus, that issue was not properly before the URNRD or the district court. Appellants could not allege that they were entitled to a greater allocation of ground water because they did not timely challenge URNRD's prior allocation order.

Defendant was convicted by the district court, pursuant to a jury verdict, and he appealed. The court reversed and noted that the cognate-evidence approach for determination of a lesser included offense instruction had been rejected in favor of the statutory element approach. Because it was possible for defendant to commit theft by receiving stolen property without operating a propelled vehicle, defendant was not entitled to a lesser included offense instruction. The inference instruction was reversible error, however, because it failed to comply with the requirements of Neb. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed a paternity petition in 1989 on behalf of the child, who was born in 1977. The district court determined that the father was the natural father of the child and required him to pay medical expenses related to the birth. After a hearing to review the father's child support obligations, he was ordered to pay $ 230 per month. On appeal, the court affirmed the order as to parentage, modified to exclude medical expenses. The child support order was reversed. The action was timely. Although the mother was barred from bringing a paternity action four years after the birth, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1411 (Reissue 1988) allowed a guardian or next friend, including the State, to assert such rights for 18 years after the child's birth. However, the part of the judgment related to medical expenses was barred by the four-year statute of limitations. If the support order gave no consideration to the father's present three children, it was an abuse of discretion. The State knew in 1977 of the mother's contention as to the paternity of the father and it could have petitioned for relief at that time, before the father's marriage to the mother of his three other children.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 77-1735 (Reissue 1990) based on an interpretation that the statute's scope did not allow for a challenge to the uniformity of the taxes that were imposed. The court affirmed the judgment against the taxpayer. The court found that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-1735 (Reissue 1990) was not intended to encompass the taxpayer's challenge to the constitutionality of the taxes. The court concluded that the taxpayer's claim for a refund of its payments that resulted from the allegedly unconstitutional taxes had to be made under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-1736.04 (Cum. Supp. 1992). The court determined that the taxpayer's action was properly dismissed because it failed to meet its burden of establishing that exemptions that were granted to certain taxpayers were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed the victim by firing a shotgun into her multiple times. Defendant alleged numerous errors on appeal. Affirming the conviction, the court said that the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to convict defendant, consistent with the jury's verdict. The evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the State, established that he intentionally killed the victim while not acting in self defense. Remanding for resentencing, the court noted plain error. Defendant's habitual criminal conviction merged with the second degree murder conviction. A sentence for use of a firearm to commit a felony was 10 years. Defendant was sentenced to one year in prison for theft of an auto, and his sentences for use of a firearm to commit a felony and theft of an auto were ordered to run consecutively, but concurrently with his sentence for second degree murder. This was error, as Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1205(3) (Reissue 1989) required the 10-year sentence for use of a firearm to commit a felony to run consecutively to the sentence imposed for the predicate felony, the second degree murder.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered the construction lien foreclosure in favor of the builder. On appeal, the court affirmed. In light of the buyer's ongoing complaints, its use of the facility did not imply that it had accepted the facility as being in compliance. The builder substantially performed its obligations under the agreement in a workmanlike manner because the bins were completed by the fall, as agreed. The evidence was in conflict as to whether the builder breached any elevation requirement. The builder's failure to connect the aeration fan at an earlier time did not establish a breach of performance. The heat sensor cables were installed according to the manufacturer's instructions and they failed either because of design defect or improper installation. The bin rupture could have been from a defect in the manufacturer's designs as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents, for themselves and their children, brought an action against appellees, claiming that the state methods of financing public schools denied them equal protection of the law, equal and adequate educational opportunities, and uniform and proportionate taxation. The trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded with directions to dismiss. The court ruled that the parents failed to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action and that the trial court's failure to sustain the demurrers was plain error. A complaint was sufficient if, under the facts alleged, the law entitled a plaintiff to recover. Here, the parents claimed that there was a disparity in funding among school districts, but they did not specifically allege how the disparity affected the quality of students' education. There was no demonstration that the education did not meet constitutional requirements. The grant of summary judgment, therefore, was not proper because the challenge involved the sufficiency of the complaint to state a claim. The court ruled that the trial court should have sustained appellees' demurrers.</SPAN></P>

The court sustained the State's exception to the district court's decision that determined that &sect; 28-311.01 was unconstitutional. The terroristic threats statute was not unconstitutionally vague because the words &quot;threats&quot; and &quot;threatened&quot; were terms of common usage and understanding which supplied adequate and fair notice of the conduct that was prohibited. The terroristic threats statute was not overly broad because it did not unconstitutionally burden, punish, or prohibit the freedom of speech that was guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Neb.

The State had a substantial governmental interest in protecting persons against harm and it achieved that legitimate objective by preventing or punishing a terroristic threat, even if speech was used to communicate the threat.

The denial of a stay was affirmed, as was the determination that the first three grounds for termination did not constitute good cause. The court held that the mere affidavit of defendant's attorney, without more, did not provide enough evidence of inability to defend to convince it that the district court abused its discretion when in denying a stay. Because the record was insufficient to dispose of defendant's third contention, the case was remanded. Defendant contended that alleged activities warranted plaintiff's termination and precluded his recovery for wrongful discharge. Based on the record, the court could not determine whether the argument had merit. On remand, the court first had to determine whether the alleged misconduct actually occurred, and if so, whether the activity would justify termination. If both inquiries generated affirmative responses, plaintiff would not be entitled to damages for the period following his termination. The court reversed the determination that posttermination evidence of misconduct did not affect the employee's recovery.</SPAN></P>

Under the language of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 68-1002, plaintiff's act of depriving himself of resources was not, in an of itself, a disqualifying act; the disqualification resulted from doing so with the intention and for the purpose of becoming eligible for public assistance.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction for selling anabolic steroids, in violation of Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 28-446, 28-447 (Cum Supp. 1990). The court affirmed the judgment, finding that defendant failed to satisfy the burden of proving that &sect;&sect; 28-446, 28-447 were unconstitutionally vague. Defendant could have reasonably understood that his conduct was proscribed by the statutes. Also, under the sections, the State was required to show that defendant sold the steroids intending that they be used for impermissible purposes and the provisions defined those permissible purposes. The court then rejected defendant's entrapment defense, finding that the State proved that the predisposition to commit the crime existed prior to and independent of the government's contact. Defendant's familiarity with and demonstrable orientation to the steroid sale constituted relevant evidence of predisposition. Finally, the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction. The evidence showed that defendant delivered steroids to the informant for human use and other than a valid medical purpose and in the course of professional practice, in violation of the criminal statutes.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the motion, finding that defendant's actions were constitutionally protected and that the Act was unconstitutionally applied to him. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the issue was whether defendant as a person involved in the display of erotic nudity had the purpose of real or simulated overt sexual gratification in generating the photographs. Because that issue was not discernible from the record, the trial court erred in ruling that the motion to quash was the proper procedure to raise the constitutionality of the Act as applied to defendant. Also, whether Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-1463.03 was constitutionally applied to defendant and his conduct required a determination of his intent.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a Nebraska nonprofit corporation organized for the purpose of operating hospitals for the general public and nursing homes for aged and infirm persons, appealed a judgment of the District Court for Lancaster County (Nebraska), which upheld the requirement of defendant Nebraska Department of Social Services that plaintiff reimburse the Department for depreciation claimed in the operation of 11 of its facilities that had been sold.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's facilities were certified by the Nebraska Department of Social Services as providers of long-term-care service under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1396. Under contracts with the Department, each facility was entitled to reimbursement as provided in the Nebraska state plan for determining long-term-care reimbursement and the Nebraska regulations codifying the plan. 471 Neb. Admin. Code &sect; 12-011.08D required recapture of depreciation when a long-term-care facility was sold for a profit. On appeal, the court agreed with the interpretation by a United States Court of Appeals of the purpose of depreciation recapture and found that it was not the equivalent of a tax that violated Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2. The court held that no fundamental right or suspect class was at issue. Based on precedent, plaintiff was not entitled to conclude that its depreciation reimbursement was not subject to being recaptured upon the sale of its facilities, and it did not have a constitutionally protected property right to reimbursements. That the Department did not consider the effect of inflation and market forces in determining the amount of depreciation to be recaptured was not grounds for reversal.</SPAN></P>

Under Lincoln, Neb., Mun.

The landowner did not comply and the city cut the weeds. The landowner sued the city for damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The landowner alleged that the city ordinance was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the order entered by the trial court that dismissed the action. The court held that the trial court correctly found that &sect; 8.80.010 was not unconstitutionally vague and that the ordinance did not result from an unconstitutional delegation of power. In addition, the trial court correctly found that the city's actions did not deprive the landowner of due process. The record indicated that the landowner received sufficient procedural protections before his weeds were cut and therefore, due process was not offended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the inmate did not sign a waiver, the non-wage money he had received from outside sources was placed in a confiscated fund. The inmate alleged that the procedure went beyond the director's authority because Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 83-183(3) (Reissue 1987) affected only wages earned by the inmate and therefore non-wage money received by the inmate was not subject to restriction. After the inmate filed his petition, a new rule went into effect that discontinued the waiver policy. The court held that it did not appear from the record that there were issues of material fact in dispute. Also, the court noted that under the plain error doctrine, the trial court's determination that the director was entitled to judgment as a matter of law was appropriate. The court determined that no protected interest was created in the non-wage earnings and the inmate did not have a protected liberty interest that was violated when his money was placed in the confiscated fund. Finally, the court concluded that the department had the authority to promulgate the rules, the inmate provided no legal argument that set forth any contrary holding, and the question regarding the waiver policy was rendered moot.</SPAN></P>

Appellant, the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission, on the recommendation of appellant city, denied the licenses.

The city and the Commission sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court held that both the city's recommendation and the Commission's adoption of it were arbitrary and unreasonable and constituted an abuse of discretion.

Stat. &sect; 53-132(2)(a), (b), and (c) (Reissue 1984) regarding the issuance of a liquor license and that the Commission's denial of the licenses constituted an abuse of discretion. The court found that the store operated in a lawful manner, that there were no significant citizen protests, that the city's population was increasing, and that the stores were all located in areas zoned for business or commercial use. In addition, the court found that the issuance of the license would not render existing law enforcement inadequate. The court also held that the stated reasons for denying the licenses were inadequate and actually supported issuance of the licenses. The court further found that the Commission erroneously relied on a city ordinance that distinguished between dual business operators without valid justification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Experts testified that the doctor's conduct violated professional practice standards. Section 71-147(10) defined unprofessional conduct as all acts specified in &sect; 71-148 and other acts defined in rules and regulations adopted and promulgated by the board of examiners with the health department's approval. The state conceded that neither &sect; 71-148 nor the rules and regulations concerning the practice of medicine specifically proscribed the doctor's conduct, but it claimed that &sect; 71-147(10) embraced the doctor's conduct because it violated the medical profession's practice standards.

The court reversed and directed the district court on remand to reverse the director's order and command dismissal of the cause. The court held that &sect; 71-147(10) did not encompass the doctor's conduct because the practice standards of the medical profession were not one of the specified sources for determining what constituted unprofessional conduct, no rules or regulations had been adopted, and &sect; 71-148 did not deal with the prescription of drugs.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the evidence before the sentencing court established that defendant's prior plea-based DUI convictions were constitutionally valid for the purpose of enhancing the penalty for defendant's DUI conviction in 1992. At the sentence hearing and for the purpose of enhancing defendant's sentence for the 1992 conviction, the State offered a certified copy of a journal entry reflecting that in 1985, 1982, and 1979, defendant was convicted of drunk driving. The exhibit also reflected that defendant was represented by counsel on the 1985 conviction, but failed to disclose whether defendant was represented by counsel, or waived his right to counsel, in either the 1979 or 1982 convictions. The court affirmed, in part, the appellate court's affirmance of defendant's conviction for drunk driving, but reversed the judgment of the appellate court which affirmed the enhanced sentence imposed on defendant based on the prior convictions that were not shown to have been constitutionally valid.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-416(1)(a) (Reissue 1989) and failure to affix the requisite tax stamps to marijuana or controlled substances in his possession in violation of the Nebraska Tax Stamp Act, Neb.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that he should not have been convicted for the failure to affix tax stamps to his marijuana because the Act violated the Fifth Amendment. The court held that the convictions were valid. The Act was constitutional because, though the conduct under Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-4309 was inherently criminal, no public employee collecting the tax was to forward information about defendant to a prosecutor. Also, defendant did not have to disclose his name, social security number, or other identifying evidence when he got the stamps. Thus, the Act's confidentiality provision, Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 77-4315, was broad enough to protect defendant. The Act complied with Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, because it was not an invalid personal property tax where it was based on value and not on weight. Thus, the tax was an excise tax because it was based on the marijuana's use or sale. &quot;Dealer&quot; was consistently defined because Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect;, 28-416(6), 77-4301(2), which defined it differently, dealt with different subjects. There was probable cause to support the search warrant, though there were handwritten notes on the warrant, where the handwriting completed the warrant's requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A city employee brought an action against a municipal corporation asserting that a local rule preventing him from seeking office was unconstitutional pursuant to U.S. Const. amend.

The city employee prevailed on the pendent state law claim and the trial court issued him an award of attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The court affirmed the trial court's decision, finding that when a plaintiff prevailed on a state law claim in a civil rights action, an award of attorney's fees was appropriate if the pendent claim arose from the same common nucleus of operative fact as the constitutional claim, the action raised a substantial federal claim, and the action was successful. In its decision, the court noted that a claim was insubstantial only if its unsoundness was clear and there was no controversy at all, and it declared that the city employee's claim had involved candidacy, a substantial issue.

The officer stopped the vehicle, observed that the sticker was still valid, but went to the driver's window and asked defendant for a bill of sale and vehicle registration. During the exchange, the officer noted that defendant exhibited indications of intoxication. The trial court and the appellate court held that Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 60-320(5), which required officers to arrest and prosecute violators of registration statutes, required the officer to stop the vehicle. On appeal, the court reversed and noted that the state had the burden to prove the reasonableness of the search and that motorists did not lose all reasonable expectation of privacy simply because the vehicle was subject to government regulation. The court then held that reasonable suspicion, as a prerequisite for a constitutional investigatory stop, could not be based only on a police officer's desire to verify compliance with motor vehicle registration statutes and that random and roving decal checks by police in the exercise of unfettered discretion were impermissible under the Fourth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

State. 77-202(7) (Reissue 1990) was not decided because the property was taxable in any event. The court held that the taxpayer did not meet his burden to rebut the presumption that the Board acted upon sufficient and competent evidence. He never calculated an alternative assessment. He did not provide additional documents to the Assessor. The court held that the only satisfactory evidence of value of the taxpayer's personal rental property came from the Assessor. Because the exemption for business inventory from personal property tax was ab initio unconstitutional, the taxpayer's personal rental property was subject to personal property tax.

It was constitutionally permissible for the board to cure the prior defect by refunding the difference between the tax paid and the tax which would have been paid if all taxpayers had been treated equally. The relief ordered by the board corrected the disproportionality in the taxation of the taxpayers' property within the class of all tangible property in compliance with Neb. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The taxpayers were provided a remedy assuring that they were not obligated to pay more than their fair share of the total property tax burden, which was the amount they would have paid if the state had properly included all property on the tax rolls that should have been taxed.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 28-511.01 (Reissue 1989). Defendant's sentence was enhanced because his conviction was found to be a third offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of shoplifting a wallet. He testified that he remembered picking up the wallet while he was in the store, but that he did not remember that he still had it on his person when he attempted to leave the store. On appeal, he contended that the trial court erred by excluding evidence of his poor memory, that the trial court erred by imposing a five year sentence for shoplifting an item which was valued at only $ 12.99, and that he was prejudiced by juror misconduct. The court affirmed, holding that (1) defendant was permitted to testify that he did not remember that he had the wallet on his person when he attempted to leave the store and the excluded testimony about his alleged memory problems was not relevant and did not add anything to that point; (2) defendant's sentence was not excessive given defendant's criminal history and that fact that he did not appear to have been rehabilitated after he served his prior criminal sentences; and (3) defendant failed to present evidence of the alleged juror misconduct in his bill of exceptions and thus, in the absence of plain error, the assignment of error with respect to the juror misconduct had to be disregarded.</SPAN></P>

The employee allegedly took a lunch break in excess of the union contract allotted time.

The employee appealed the disciplinary order. The commission upheld the disciplinary decision, and the employee appealed to the trial court, alleging for the first time that the employer violated the employee's due process rights. On appeal, the court agreed with the trial court's judgment that the record failed to indicate that the employee was given a proper hearing prior to his suspension. The employee was entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present the employee's side of the story. The employee was permitted to raise procedural due process defenses in the first judicial tribunal to review the administrative action.</SPAN></P>

They intended to steal items from the home. Defendant and his friend sexually assaulted the victim. Defendant sliced the victim's wrist open with knife after he beat and tried to strangle her. The trial court convicted defendant of using a firearm during the commission of a felony and of first-degree murder. He argued on appeal that the trial court wrongly failed to suppress his statements, wrongly failed to transfer the case to the juvenile court, wrongly failed to quash the jury panel, wrongly instructed the jury on reasonable doubt, and wrongly failed to grant a new trial because of the prosecutor's conduct during closing argument. The court affirmed defendant's convictions. Defendant's confession after he requested an attorney during custodial interrogation was voluntary because he initiated the conversation with police by asking if his friend had &quot;spilled his guts.&quot; Defendant's evidence that two members of the venire with Hispanic surnames were not placed on the jury was not sufficient to establish a prima facie case that the jury panel violated the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The Commission also disputed the district court's direction to issue the license.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the Commission and appellee-cross-appellant city contested the jurisdiction of the district court. The court rejected their argument that the statutes governing venue had been changed and, based on Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-1,116(5) (Reissue 1984), held that the company invoked the jurisdiction of the proper district court. The court ruled that, based on prior law applicable when the company initiated the steps required to invoke the jurisdiction of the district court, the court's review of the denial of the license was by appeal and the court reviewed the matter de novo on the record. Again relying on prior law, the court concluded that the company met the conditions in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-132(2)(a), (b), (c) (Reissue 1984). The court considered the evidence in light of the factors set forth in Neb. Rev. Stat. &sect; 53-132(2)(d), (3)(a)-(j) (Reissue 1984). The court held that there was nothing to persuade it to conclude that granting the license would be other than in the public interest. Finally, the court held that the record met the condition of &sect; 53-132(2)(d) that issuance of the license was or would be required by present or future public convenience and necessity.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that (1) the stepfather's application of 40 to 60 strikes to the children with a belt each week was abusive and excessive; (2) &sect; 43-247(3)(a) was not void for vagueness despite appellants' contention to the contrary; and (3) the evidence of the domestic violence in the home more than justified the assumption of jurisdiction by the juvenile court and the beatings merely emphasized the lack of parental care.</SPAN></P>
