<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, the City of East Chicago, sought review of a judgment of the Lake Superior Court (Indiana) holding that East Chicago, Ind., Ordinance No. 1-2123 (14-36), which contained a residency requirement for members of the city fire force, was unconstitutional because it was superseded and preempted by state law and granting appellee firefighters' request for an injunction on the enforcement thereof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In granting the relief requested by the firefighters, the trial court found that the ordinance was unconstitutional on its face and as applied due to the enactment of Ind.

Code &sect; 19-1-37.5-10 (1971), which listed the criteria the City was required to follow in promoting firemen and did not include residency. The court held that the trial court acted properly in invalidating East Chicago, Ind., Ordinance No. 1-2123 (14-36) and in enjoining its enforcement because: (1) a city could not impose regulations that were in conflict with rights granted or reserved by the General Assembly; (2) such a conflict existed when an ordinance sought to prohibit that which a statute expressly permitted; (3) the power to regulate the residence of municipal firemen vested in the State when it enacted a statute setting forth specific residence requirements; and (4) Ind. Code &sect; 19-1-2-1 (1971), which expressly permitted firemen employed by the City to live within 15 miles thereof, could not be read to permit the City to apply a more stringent residence requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Undisputed evidence was presented that the driver was speeding on a two-lane highway at night and racing with another car. However, evidence was also presented that no other acts of &quot;recklessness&quot; occurred and that driver was not familiar with the dip in the road that obscured his vision of the car that he collided with. The trial court determined that the administrator failed to sustain his burden of proof regarding the driver's guilt of wilful or wanton misconduct within the meaning of Ind. Code &sect; 9-3-3-1. On appeal, the court affirmed. While the administrator argued that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding in his favor, the court found that he had misconstrued his appellate burden and that it had to review the record to determine whether any basis existed in the evidence from which no reasonable person could have failed to find the driver liable. Although it was a close question, the court held that the evidence was not such that the driver's speeding under the circumstances not only established negligence but also the necessary high probability of injury to the passenger and the driver's intentional or conscious disregard of such a probability.</SPAN></P>

The state also sought removal of deposits previously made.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state sought an injunction prohibiting defendants from making deposits on the floodway of a river. The trial court found that defendants had unlawfully obstructed the floodway. On appeal, the court held that it could not agree with defendants' conclusion that the state was seeking a flood easement. No easement was sought by the state in its complaint, nor was evidence at trial admitted to show that an easement was sought. Further, the court stated that the government had the inherent power or &quot;police power&quot; to enact laws, within constitutional limits, to promote order, safety, health, morals, and the general welfare of society. The purpose of the Flood Control Act and those means used to reach the purpose were rationally related and therefore within the police power of the state to promote order, safety, health, and welfare of society. Controlling the use of rivers and adjoining property was of great importance to the welfare of society. The court held that the state's action was a control of use and not a taking, and therefore was not unconstitutional, even as applied to defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant company, the owner of a peninsula that extended into a lake, sought review of the judgment of Noble Circuit Court (Indiana), which found for appellee individual, the owner of the only unsubmerged land adjoining the peninsula, in the company's suit to acquire an easement over the individual's land. The peninsula was formed in 1838 when the state dammed a river. The company based its claim to an easement on Indiana Code &sect; 32-5-3-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Ind. Code &sect; 32-5-3-1 provided that where, heretofore or hereafter, a landowner's lands were shut off from a public highway by the state's erection of a dam, if the landowner could not secure an easement over adjacent lands, he was to have a right of easement by necessity. The trial court held that the relief provided by this statute was available only to those who held title to affected land at the time it was deprived of access by the state, and that to construe the statute to allow a taking by a subsequent owner would sanction a taking for a private purpose in violation of the Indiana Constitution. The trial court found the company sought the easement for a private use. The court affirmed the trial court. The use of &quot;heretofore&quot; in the statute was insufficient to demonstrate an intent of retroactivity. Further, under Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 21, private property could not be taken for a private purpose. The company wished easy access to its land. That was not sufficient to establish a public purpose. Although the state had a duty to compensate those whom it deprived of access, that duty ran to the landowner at the time of the taking, not to each subsequent owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, residential customers of appellee gas company, sought review of two orders of the Public Service Commission of Indiana (PSC). These orders granted the gas company permission to purchase natural gas from a source other than its contract supplier, in order to make up deficiencies, and to assess the costs equally among all classes of its customers. The residential customers claimed that they should not share in the cost.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The residential customers claimed that the costs of the gas purchase should be borne solely by the gas company's commercial customers. The court rejected this contention, held that the PSC's orders were not unreasonable, and affirmed the orders. The court found that this supplemental gas was commingled with the gas purchased from the gas company's contract supplier and that the residential customers would use it. The court further found that the purchase was essential to serve residential customers on peak days. In addition, the court found that the supplemental gas merely replaced the more expensive propane that would have been provided by the contract supplier, and such costs would have been tracked equally to all of the users. The court found that the supplemental gas purchase produced a real benefit to residential customers because it provided the same quantity of gas at a much lower price than the propane. In addition, the court found that the purchase of the supplemental gas enabled the gas company to avoid curtailments that would have resulted in increased charges to residential consumers through the cost plus return mandates of the relevant rate statutes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the agency's order that approved the gas company's purchase of gas from a source other than its contract supplier and that permitted the gas company to assess the costs equally among all classes of its customers.</SPAN></P>

During certain tax years, the taxpayer received over $ 1,000,000 in commissions but only 23.7 percent of the commissions resulted from sales to the Pennsylvania corporation's customers in Indiana. After an audit, the state assessed a gross income tax upon commissions received from sales made to customers in Illinois and Michigan. The taxpayer filed a claim for refund. The trial court determined that the taxpayer was entitled to a refund. On appeal, the court affirmed. Because the commissions were not gross receipts received from sources outside Indiana, they were not excluded from the statutory definition of &quot;gross income,&quot; and the state had sufficient contacts with the taxpayer to meet the requirements of the Due Process Clause. However, the income was from sales that were made in interstate commerce, and the state was thus forbidden to tax income made from those sales.</SPAN></P>

The court found that &sect; 35-1-32.5-1 did not infringe upon defendant's right to confront witnesses because he was not precluded from impeaching the prosecutrix on grounds other that her prior sexual conduct. The court also found that there was a reasonable basis for the disparate treatment of rape defendants and that &sect; 35-1-32.5-1 was not an ex post facto law. The court determined that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it restricted the scope of cross-examination of the prosecutrix. It was not proper for defendant to ask the prosecutrix whether she had ever smoked marijuana, and any visits to a hospital other than the date of the medical examination for the rape were not relevant. The court found that it was proper for the prosecution to impeach defendant's credibility through the use of prior inconsistent statements in his testimony in a previous trial. The court concluded that there was substantial evidence of probative value to support the jury's verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On review, defendant argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and that his sentence had to be reduced. The court held that a post-conviction remedy was not a substitute for a direct appeal. Thus, the court held that defendant's first allegation of error was waived for failure to raise it in the initial motion to correct errors filed by appellate counsel. The court ruled that even if the issue was properly before the court, defendant had not effectively demonstrated that he was incompetently represented. The court concluded that there was a strong presumption that an attorney had rendered effective assistance, and strong and convincing proof had to be presented to overcome the burden. The court found that defendant claimed that his trial counsel failed to subpoena two witnesses who would have substantiated his alibi. The court also found that there was no assertion made to support the charge of incompetence other than the fact that the attorney was subsequently disbarred. Thus, the court held that defendant had not shown that he was denied adequate assistance or that his trial made a mockery of justice. Lastly, the court held that defendant was correctly sentenced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee city filed a motion to dismiss the cooperative's challenge to the appointment of appraisers in a condemnation action on the ground that the appeal had not been certified pursuant to Ind.

Code &sect; 32-11-1-5 and not that of Ind. R. App. P. 4(B). The court dismissed the appeal, holding that Ind. Code &sect; 32-11-1-5 was superseded as to those provisions that purported to govern the appeal of interlocutory orders in eminent domain proceedings. The history of the appellate rules clearly demonstrated that statutory appellate procedure was superseded when that procedure was in conflict with the rules of court. The court also held that those categories of appealable interlocutory orders listed in Ind. R. App. P. 4(B) were exclusive; accordingly, any interlocutory order not falling within the first four categories of Rule 4(B) had to be certified pursuant to Rule 4(B)(5) prior to its appeal.

The trial court granted the motion. The officer appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the officer was not entitled to the due process protections of a hearing or an appeal from his dismissal. The court reasoned that the officer never acquired a constitutionally-protected property interest in his job entitling him to due process protections. The court also concluded that the classification of police officers as either probationary or non-probationary for the purpose of termination in Ind. Code &sect; 17-3-14-7 (1971) did not violate equal protection of the law.

Defendant was convicted by the trial court of aggravated assault and battery. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that double jeopardy was not violated because the waiver hearing was conducted for the purpose of determining whether the juvenile should be transferred to criminal court and treated as an adult, and was not an adjudicatory hearing with the purpose of finding the juvenile to be a delinquent. The court found that the course of action actually followed by the juvenile court as demonstrated by the record resulted in a properly conducted waiver hearing. The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court's failure to grant a continuance until a transcript of the juvenile proceedings could be obtained denied defendant the opportunity to adequately prepare his defense. The court found that the State did not disregard any discovery order and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion for discovery.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in not modifying the sentence imposed for robbery from 25 years, the maximum sentence for robbery under Ind.

At the time defendant was charged, convicted and sentenced for robbery, who's maximum penalty was 25 years, the statutory penalty for the greater offense of armed robbery was a term of not less than 10 nor more than 20 years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The families initiated the action against the Departments alleging that their implementation of welfare under the Manual was unconstitutional and in violation of federal statutes. The Departments sought review of the trial court's judgment contending that they were allowed to pay less than the maximum benefits under the Manual when a person voluntarily terminated their employment. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 602(a)(19)(A)(v), a state plan for aid and services to needy families with children was to contain, as a condition of eligibility, a provision that every person was required to register for employment unless such person was a mother or relative of a child under six who was caring for the child. The court held that Congress gave the states broad discretion as to the welfare programs as long as the state's actions were not in violation of any specific provision of the constitution. However, the court determined that federal law controlled in a conflict. The court held that, because the Manual's provisions regarding employment conflicted with the federal law, the federal law controlled, and the Manual was unconstitutional.

Defendant appealed the dismissal of his appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court held that rule 16(B) violated defendant's equal protection rights. Rule 16(B) was not constitutionally invalid even if it discriminated between Marion County small claims appellants and all other appellants in the state because the operation of a law was not required to be uniform through out the state.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the sodomy statute,&nbsp;&sect; 35-1-89-1, was not unconstitutional by reason of vagueness. The court held that the various acts which were considered to be sodomy included the act of fellatio, which was alleged in the case. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury's conclusion that defendant was guilty of performing fellatio as charged. The court held that the State's case against defendant was neither wholly circumstantial nor did the evidence indicate only a mere suspicion or possibility that defendant committed the act of fellatio upon the victim. The court found that eyewitness testimony established that the two men had assumed a position appropriate to the act, that they were close enough to be touching, that the victim's pants were unzipped, and that his penis was erect. The court concluded that that the eyewitness evidence was sufficient to support the inference drawn by the jury that defendant's mouth had been in contact with the victim's penis.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 9-4-13-1 et seq. (1971), and suspended his license to drive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The driver was convicted of traffic offenses three times. The driver was adjudged to be a habitual traffic offender pursuant to &sect; 9-4-13-1 et seq., and his license to drive was suspended. On appeal, the court affirmed. Based on precedent, the court held that the Act was not unconstitutional as an ex post facto law, a bill of attainder, or based upon double jeopardy. The court found that because the revocation of the driver's license pursuant to the Act was a civil proceeding, which was quasi-administrative in nature, and not the type of criminal or civil proceeding for which a jury trial was provided at common law, trial by jury was not required. The court found no violation of equal protection based on the State's mere laxity to administer the law because there was no intentional scheme to discriminate against a certain protected class of persons to which the driver belonged. We find no denial of equal protection. The court held that the suspension of the driver's license for 10 years was not cruel and unusual punishment. The court found that because the 10-year suspension was not a punitive act, the Act did not unconstitutionally deny due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that if the denial of benefits did not &quot;burden&quot; plaintiff's free exercise rights, compensation could properly be denied. However, if the court discerned an infringement of such rights, unemployment compensation had to be awarded unless the abridgement was justified by a &quot;compelling state interest.&quot; The court held that the disqualifying provision of &sect; 22-4-15-1, as it applied to plaintiff, cast an impermissible burden on his First Amendment guarantee to the free exercise of his religion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, two former fire chiefs, challenged a decision of the Howard Superior Court No. 2 (Indiana), which entered an Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Neither of the former fire chiefs received any written notice of their demotions or reasons therefor, except the chief's statement that the demotions were &quot;political.&quot; The former fire chiefs argued for an expansion of Ind. Code &sect; 18-1-11-3 (1974) to cover demotions as well as discharges. The court held that the statute was inapplicable by its terms because it applied only to dismissals. The former fire chiefs had failed to establish a property or liberty interest in their rank sufficient to invoke due process protection because there was no Indiana law that affirmatively created an enforceable expectation of tenure in rank, and there was no liberty interest because the reasons for the demotion were not published. Although the collective labor contract provided no property interest because there was no contractual guarantee of continued employment at a particular rank, the city might have violated the grievance procedures. Also, if the former fire chiefs could have proved the demotions were political, they had a colorable claim under the First Amendment because their refusal to endorse the mayor's bid for re-election violated the right to freedom of association.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the dismissal with respect the constitutional claims under a property and a liberty interest due process analysis. The court reversed the dismissal with respect to the claims for First Amendment violations and a breach of the collective bargaining agreement. The action was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The patient was delivered by the doctor at the hospital. The patient was born with severe and permanent brain damage. Some of the testimony was in dispute, but what was clear was that the mother was not observed at all times during the period before she gave birth, that the mother was given a dangerous drug called Pitocin, that the mother developed a Bandl's Ring during labor, that her uterine ruptured, and that the child was expelled into the mother's abdomen, which cut off oxygen and leading to the injuries sustained. The court affirmed the judgment for the doctor. In light of the conflicting evidence concerning the appropriateness of the doctor's actions the jury was entitled to believe or disbelieve the patient's evidence. There was no error in the trial court's instructions to the jury. The court reversed and remanded the judgment for the hospital. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that the hospital breached its duty to the patient by failing to properly monitor the mother before labor and that failure to monitor was the proximate cause of injuries.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In an unrelated case, a county ordinance regulating massage parlors was declared unconstitutional. After time for appeal in that case elapsed, the masseuse and the owner were charged with engaging in conduct that violated the ordinance. They filed motions to dismiss, which were sustained by the trial court based on the earlier ruling. The state appealed. On review, the court held that the attorney general was not entitled to notice prior to a defendant's constitutional attack on an ordinance. Res judicata, collateral estoppel, and estoppel did not preclude examination of such constitutional issues. The failure of a party to appeal a prior constitutional decision did not prevent an appellate court from reviewing those issues in a separate case. The county's attempted regulation of conduct which was subject to state statutes could not provide for imprisonment, yet the provision for a fine remained effective. The court determined that the masseuse and the owner were entitled to rely on the unappealed trial court judgment as to the ordinance's unconstitutionality until the publication of an opinion to the contrary, and that they could assert such reliance as a defense upon remand.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The dismissal of the charges against the masseuse and the owner was reversed and remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>

The university's repeated attempts to reach an agreement with the professor concerning the Bible readings were unsuccessful, and he was dismissed. The professor filed an action for wrongful discharge. He alleged that the university violated his constitutional right to the free exercise of his religion. The superior court granted the university's motion for summary judgment, and the court affirmed. The court held that, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 20-12-1-2 (1971), the university was justified in discharging the professor after he refused to cease his religious activities in the classroom. The alternative the professor afforded to his students to leave the classroom during the readings was insufficient to protect their own constitutional rights in light of the professor's position of control, the peer pressure and disapproval from other students, and the coercive impact upon the students' free exercise of their own religious rights. The university maintained religious neutrality and promoted secular education though valid time, place, and manner restrictions on the professor's exercise of religion.</SPAN></P>

The individual argued that the action was against a board of commissioners, not a county, and thus was not covered by the Act, but rather by the provisions of Ind.

The individual also argued that, because she complied with the provisions in &sect; 17-2-1-1 et seq., she did not have to comply with the Act's notice provision. The court affirmed the trial court's decision to grant the motions, holding that the action was barred by the individual's failure to file a timely notice. The suit clearly against the county, by and through its board of commissioners, and was thus covered by the Act. Also, to the extent of any conflict, the provisions of &sect;17-2-1-1 et seq. were impliedly repealed by the provisions of the Act.

Finally, defendants claimed that they were entitled to an adversary hearing before the magazines were seized.

The court also held that the charging affidavits were not void for multiplicity because each defendant was convicted of one offense and received a single punishment.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.

The court also held that the no-interest provision of &sect; 32-11-1-8 was prospective only and did not apply, that the State's appeal was without merit and was prosecuted in bad faith, and that a 10 percent penalty was required to be assessed against the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The decedent died before the child was born, and there was no evidence that the decedent knew that his fiance was pregnant at the time of the decedent's death. The Board found that the decedent never acknowledged the child as his illegitimate child nor affirmed any such acknowledgment and that the child did not qualify as a dependent of decedent under the Indiana Workmen's Compensation Act. The child argued that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-3-3-19(d), which provided that an illegitimate child was a presumptive dependent only if the father acknowledged the child, was unconstitutional. The court agreed and reversed the Board. The court invalidated the acknowledgment requirement of &sect; 22-3-3-19(d). Because Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 31-4-1-2 imposed a duty the decedent to support the child regardless of whether the decedent was married to the child's mother the child met the remaining valid requirements of Ind. Stat.

The officer sought judicial review of his termination. At a hearing in the trial court, a document, signed by the board members and ordering the officer's reinstatement, was introduced into evidence. The trial court reversed the board's &quot;announced&quot; decision. On petition for rehearing, the court reversed the trial court's decision. The court held that it had jurisdiction over the case because the clerk of court's certificate was acceptable and the fact that it showed receipt of the bill of exceptions at a date later than the date of the clerk's certificate was of no great significance. Further, without a proper board decision there was nothing for the trial court to review nor could there be a determination of the issues anew. Finally, the board was properly constituted because Ind.

The officer found that the door was unlocked at the laundromat and the burglar alarm had been shut off. The officer saw defendant at a pizza place and asked him to step outside. When the officer asked defendant questions about the laundromat, defendant yelled obscenities and doubled his fists. The officer arrested him for being a disorderly person. Defendant broke away and took a swing at the officer's co-worker. When the officer handcuffed defendant, he saw a blue money bag protruding from defendant's pocket. Defendant was adjudged to be a delinquent for committing second degree burglary. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not err in overruling defendant's motions to suppress evidence stemming from his encounter with the officer.

He also argued that the convictions listed in the certified BMV records were not sufficient to allow his adjudication as an habitual offender. The court found no error. The driver introduced no substantial evidence to show that he was not the person listed in the BMV records or that the records were in error. His evidence that some signatures were illegible, that the drivers' license numbers were different, and that he could not remember his convictions was equivocal. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the trial court's finding that the driver was the same individual identified in the BMV records, that he had been convicted of three or more offenses listed in &sect; 9-4-13-3 within a 10 year period, and that he was therefore an habitual traffic offender.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owners sought a use variance for the operation of an adult bookstore. The Board denied the variance at a public hearing where the only evidence presented was testimony of the owners. The trial court found that the owners presented substantial evidence on all points necessary to grant the variance, that the Board's decision was arbitrary and capricious and that the decision constituted an unconstitutional prior restraint on the owners' First Amendment rights. The court reversed. In order to reverse the Board's order, the trial court had to find that each of the five statutory prerequisites set forth in Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 18-7-2-71 (1974) were met. The trial court could not have properly found that the evidence that supported each prerequisite was such that no reasonable man could fail to accept that prerequisite as proved. It was inappropriate to require justification of the Board's denial of the variance by substantial evidence because the burden was on the owners to establish the existence of each of the five prerequisites. The Board was not required to appear and testify or offer evidence in opposition to the variance. The Board's interest was not in censorship but location.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff lessors filed an action against defendants, lessee and assignee, for damages for anticipatory breach of contract, injunctive relief to prevent the lessee from dissolving, appointment of a receiver and attorney's fees. The trial court (Indiana) denied all requested relief after a bench trial. The lessors appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The lessee assigned its lease obligations to the assignee. The lessee also dissolved and sought a certificate of dissolution from the state. Because the lease executed by the parties contained no provisions that could have discharged the lessee from its contractual obligations, and there was no novation, the lessee remained fully liable for future rental payments under the lease. It was erroneous to apply Ind. Code &sect; 23-1-7-1 (1971) which governed corporate dissolutions to the finding that the lessee was not liable for damages to the lessors for breaching the lease agreement, because &sect; IC 23-1-7-1 outlined the necessary procedures for effecting a voluntary dissolution, but it did not provide immunity from civil actions alleging damages as a result of the dissolution. Therefore, the lessee remained liable for future rental payments. But, because the assignee fully performed all covenants of under the lease agreement, including payment of rentals, the lessors failed to prove they were damaged. Lessors could not have recovered an award of attorney's fees under the lease agreement because they failed to prevail on the merits of their causes of action.</SPAN></P>

On the wife's first appeal the court affirmed because her brief did not contain a verbatim statement of the dissolution decree. The case was remanded to the court by the state supreme court, which found that the error was cured by the presence of the decree in the husband's brief. On remand the court affirmed. The husband's prior petition for dissolution of marriage that was filed in Tennessee was dismissed because the court found him in contempt for failing to pay his support payments. The court found that the action in Tennessee did not bar the suit in Indiana because no action was pending in Tennessee. The court found that it was proper for the trial court to automatically grant dissolution on a finding that the marriage was irretrievably broken, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-11.4-3(a). The court also found that the wife was not denied procedural due process because there was no interference with a cognizable property right.</SPAN></P>

On this award the trial court computed interest at four per cent per annum pursuant to Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 32-11-1-8 (1971). The landowner claimed that computation of interest at four per cent deprived the landowner of the just compensation which Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 21 required. The court held that the Indiana General Assembly made provision for interest on condemnation awards at the rate of four per cent per annum. 1965 Ind. Acts, ch. 344, &sect; 1. Further, an act of the General Assembly enjoyed a strong presumption of constitutionality. A court may not have held an act unconstitutional except on the clearest showing of invalidity, and all doubts must have been resolved in favor of the statute. Finally, there was no indication that the interest rate on condemnation judgments was ever meant to stand in direct relation to the legal rate of interest. Although the legal rate was six per cent in 1965, the General Assembly chose to set the rate in condemnation actions at four per cent.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision, finding that Ind. Code &sect; 8-6-7.7-3, conferring authority on the commission to abolish grade crossings, was controlling over Ind. Code &sect; 18-1-1.5-8, which conferred authority on the city to do so, because the commission's authority was in addition to the city's. The commission's finding that the public safety outweighed the public convenience was supported by substantial evidence that there had been numerous accidents there, that the crossings had a high hazard index, and that the crossings were situated between two major grade separated arterial highways approximately one-half mile apart. The commission was within its discretion in denying the city's motion for rehearing because the &quot;new&quot; evidence that the closing would have deprived senior citizens of services was easily discoverable prior to the hearing and would not have resulted in a change of the commission's order.</SPAN></P>

When he could no longer pay the debts, he filed for bankruptcy and was discharged from paying the debts incurred during the marriage. He failed to list, as a separate obligation, his duty to hold the wife harmless on those debts assumed in the property settlement agreement. A creditor obtained a judgment against the wife as a joint obligor and she petitioned for bankruptcy. She commenced contempt proceedings against the husband based on his failure to comply with the settlement agreement. The trial court held the husband in contempt and ordered him to pay the wife's attorney fees for the bankruptcy petition. The husband appealed. The court held that the order was enforceable by contempt proceedings and that the husband was not discharged as to his obligation to hold the wife harmless on the joint debts. However, the court reversed the contempt judgment because the wife chose to petition for bankruptcy rather than paying the debts. Because the only harm she suffered was in the form of attorney fees, she did not show damages compensable in contempt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The employer claimed that the employee's workers' compensation claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The employee claimed that the statute was inapplicable because the employer had committed a fraud against the employee. The Industrial Board found for the employer and dismissed the claim. The employee did not appeal the Board's decision, but instead filed suit for fraud. The court held that the Board correctly ruled it was powerless to consider the employee's fraud claim. Hence, the dismissal of the employee's claim was based upon lack of jurisdiction and therefore did not preclude litigation of the fraud issue in a civil action. However, in future cases, the court held that the Board would have jurisdiction to determine whether an employer was estopped from setting up, as a bar to a claim, the appropriate statute of limitations under Workmen's Compensation Act because the employer, its agents, or the employer's physician fraudulently induced a claimant to forbear filing a timely claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The church purchased property in an area that was zoned for residential purposes.

The circuit court upheld the board's decision and the church sought further review. The church contended that it was unconstitutionally excluded from the residential area. Appellees contended that the zoning ordinance only precluded the primary usage of the property for church purposes and the church could seek a variance. The appellate court reversed. The court held that the exclusion of the church from a residential area was in violation of the fundamental right of freedom of worship protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and Ind. Const. art. I. The court found that the denial of the permit denied the church use of its property for church purposes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In a condemnation proceeding, appellant landowners challenged a judgment from the Clark Circuit Court (Indiana), which granted motions filed by appellee conservancy district to withdraw its exceptions to the appraisers' report as well as the landowner's exception, thereby removing the issue of compensation for damages from a determination by a jury and fixing damages at the amount stated in the appraisers' report.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court issued an order of appropriation and appointment of appraisers, wherein the appraisers were ordered to file their report on a certain date. The appraisers filed their report as ordered, and on the same day the district filed exceptions thereto. Eleven days later, the landowners filed exceptions to the report. The district filed motions to withdraw its own exceptions, to withdraw the landowners' exceptions, and for summary judgment, and the trial court withdrew the exceptions. The court held that, although the district's motions were filed improperly under Clark County, Ind., R. Prac. &amp; P. Cir. Ct. 11, the landowners were not prejudiced thereby. Under the statute in effect when the proceeding was commenced, the landowners had 10 days in which to file their exceptions. Although that time period was subsequently extended, the new 20-day period did not validate the landowners' failure to file within the time period of the old law, as retroactive operation of the amendment did not apply to procedural steps already taken under the old law. Based on the untimeliness of the landowner's exceptions, no issues remained to be tried once the district withdrew its exceptions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The residents brought an action against defendants seeking a declaratory judgment that a proposed tap-on fee to access a new sanitary sewage system was unreasonable and that legislation requiring their participation in the new system was unconstitutional. The trial court rendered judgment for defendants, and the residents appealed asserting that the trial court erred in denying them a jury trial. The court reversed in part. It held that the test for deciding the right to a jury in a civil action required a classification of the claim or cause of action as either sounding in equity or at law. The court concluded that the relief requested was to determine the application and constitutionality of legislation, which was within the jurisdiction of a court of law, not equity. It ruled that the residents were entitled to trial by jury on issues involving material fact questions. The court held that claims for relief in counts challenging the constitutionality of legislation and the interaction of a statute and ordinance presented no factual issues. However, the claim as to the efficacy of a contract between the developer and the city presented numerous issues of fact for a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-8-8-1 -- 2 (1971), based upon a prior conviction that he alleged was constitutionally infirm because the record did not show that he waived his right to counsel when he submitted his guilty plea. The circuit court held that the prior conviction was invalid and granted defendant's motion for a judgment on the evidence. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment, holding that the State proved all the elements of the habitual offender offense and that the circuit court erred when in sustained defendant's motion for judgment on the evidence. The court noted that the Boykin rule provided that a determination that a guilty plea was knowingly and voluntarily made was not inferable from a silent record and that such a record resulted in a constitutionally-infirm conviction. However, the court concluded that defendant was not permitted to collaterally attack the final judgment absent errors affecting jurisdiction or the power or authority of the trial court to enter judgment. The constitutional claims rendered the judgment voidable and was more properly challenged in a petition for post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The company sought a preliminary injunction against the state highway commission to enjoin the commission from interfering with the company's use of the right-of-ways adjoining state highways and to prevent the arrest of the company's agents and employees who used those right-of-ways. The trial court denied the injunction. On appeal, the company contended that the commission did not have the authority to require certain public utilities to obtain a permit to use state highway right-of-ways. Therefore, the arrest involved was effected under color of state law, and was in violation of the company's statutory, contractual, and constitutional rights. The court reversed the order of the trial court. The court held that the permit procedure had violated the U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, and Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 24, by impairing the contractual rights previously granted to the utilities. The court reasoned that the permit procedure was unconstitutional and beyond the permissive limits of an exercise of police power because of a permit procedure's inherent right to refuse to grant the permit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The university contended that it was an arm or alter ego of the state and, therefore, the city's human rights ordinance was not applicable to it. The commission and the former employee contended that the trial court erred in finding that the commission had no statutory authority to award money damages. The court held that the opinion and order of the commission was null, void, and of no effect because there was no legitimate statutory authority for the establishment of local commission agencies. The court declared that the enabling statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 22-9-1-12 (1971), was unconstitutional because the statute contained no standards to guide a city, town, or county in the exercise of its discretion to select powers. The court determined that a statute or ordinance, which in effect reposed an absolute, unregulated, and undefined discretion in an administrative agency, bestowed arbitrary powers and was an unlawful delegation of legislative powers. The court concluded that so long as there existed residual statutory authority to usurp powers constitutionally reserved to the three departments of the state, the statute was constitutionally defective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The basis for defendants' constitutional challenge to &sect; 35-21-8-1 was that it provided a choice to be made by the jury whether a felony or a misdemeanor conviction was involved without providing any guidelines on which to make that determination.

He was joined by the remaining defendants. No objections to the instructions or forms of the verdict concerning the statute were made. In affirming, the court found that the constitutionality of the statute was not properly presented because a motion to dismiss had to be in writing and accompanied by a memorandum specifically stating the legal question involved.

It filed a claim for exemption from taxation, but the exemption was denied by the Stream Pollution Control Board (SPCB) in a letter from the acting technical secretary to the taxpayer, the Board, and the assessor for the first township. That letter stated that the taxpayer's facilities were not for water pollution control, so the exemption was denied. The assessor for the second township did not receive the letter. The taxpayer unsuccessfully appealed that denial to the Board. The trial court granted the Board's motion for summary judgment on the taxpayer's judicial challenge. The taxpayer again appealed, arguing there was no certification of the denial by the SPCB within the 90-day period required by Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 6-1-8-3 (1971), so it was entitled to the exemption The court found the letter from the SPCB official constituted a certification, and the first assessor was required to follow that determination. However, the second assessor did not receive the letter, so it could not be said as a matter of law that he received certification.</SPAN></P>

An action in trespass was filed against the company and a jury subsequently awarded punitive and compensatory damages to the landowners. Upon review, the court considered whether the trial court erred in permitting nonparties to testify concerning the company's activities upon the land, and whether a public utility had the right to cut the corn or trees of a landowner, without permission, in order to conduct an accurate survey. The court held that the company's actions substantially interfered with the landowners free use and enjoyment of their corn, which amounted to a private taking. The landowners' right to recover was conditioned upon their ability to prove the company perpetrated a tort while performing its surveying activities. Evidence of the company's course of conduct was relevant to prove whether its conduct toward the landowners was malicious thereby affording an award of punitive damages. As such, allowing the testimony of nonparties was not erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court issued an order establishing the conservancy district. The trial court approved the district plan and ordered implementation. Freeholders then petitioned to dissolve the district, and the petition was denied. The corporation filed a petition to implement the plan pursuant to &sect; 51 of the Conservancy District Act, Ind. Code &sect;19-3-2-51 (1971). The board filed a responsive pleading, the corporation filed for summary judgment, and the board filed a petition to file affirmative defenses. The court held that the Act set out the means to allow dissolution. Because dissolution could not be sought by the board, the court found that it was proper to disallow the affirmative defenses, which essentially sought to dissolve the board. The court also determined that, by limiting the matter to the issues raised by the corporation, there was no genuine issue of material fact, and the grant of summary judgment was proper. The court ruled that, although it was error for the trial court to determine that dissolution could not be considered because it had already been raised in the freeholders' action, such error was harmless because the issue could not be properly raised by the board.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court sustained the objections and dismissed the complaints, finding specifically that the Board of Directors of PSI had failed to authorize the filing of the actions or the purchase of the rural electric corporation's property. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that: (1) while the trial court might have erred in failing to make specific findings after a timely request, that error was not jurisdictional, was not properly before the court, and would not be considered; (2) the rural electric corporation waived any issue involving jurisdiction; (3) specific authorization by the PSI Board of Directors was not necessary in order to initiate an action; and (4) PSI made a good faith offer to purchase the rural electric corporation's property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State filed two informations charging defendants with causing the death of another while driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The trial court dismissed the cases because the arresting officers failed to accord defendants an opportunity to submit to chemical tests for blood alcohol. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in holding that Ind. Code &sect; 9-4-4.5-3 (1976) superseded Ind. Code &sect; 9-4-1-134 (1976). The failure to accord defendants a chemical test for blood alcohol did not affect the validity of the arrests. The only effect of failing to provide defendants with the chemical test provided for in the Implied Consent statute was that defendants could not have their driver's license suspended prior to trial. The trial court properly determined that defendants were arrested at the scene of their respective accidents. However, the trial court erred when it determined that probable cause did not exist to arrest them. The court concluded that the first defendant consented to the blood test and sufficient facts, independent of the blood test, existed to convince a neutral magistrate that probable cause existed for the arrest of the second defendant.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court reversed. The court found to the extent appellants' complaint alleged that the licensing ordinance was unconstitutional on its face, dismissal was improper where the allegations were litigable without deferring to administrative review. The court held the failure to follow administrative review procedures provided in the municipal ordinance did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction of the subject matter of the case where with respect to a court of general jurisdiction, there was no legislative act prescribing the administrative review to be had. The court concluded it was impossible for it to determine on the materials before it either that appellants failed to follow proper administrative remedies, or that their action was indeed still premature.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendants' motions to suppress. The trial court also did not err in allowing testimony from a co-defendant that he had pleaded guilty because there were other purposes in calling the co-defendant other than his plea of guilty. The State attempted to elicit from him testimony regarding what had occurred on the night in question.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment of paternity was premised entirely upon an admission of paternity by the father. The father asserted that the admission was given in open court not because it was true, but because it was the only way to be released from jail. The court held that the father's arrest was unreasonable because of the trial court's summary issuance of the arrest warrant without probable cause to believe that the father was the putative father and that he would not respond to a notice of the commencement of the suit against him. The court concluded that because both the father's arrest and detention were unreasonable, the father demonstrated that his admission of paternity was, at the very least, a prima facie product of that arrest and detention. Therefore, the court held that the admission could not properly constitute the sole basis of the lower court's judgment. Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court's decision and remanded the action to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed a decision of the Sullivan Circuit Court (Indiana) which convicted him of delivery of marijuana, a controlled substance. Defendant asserted that this matter should have been dismissed as Ind. Code &sect; 35-24.1-1-1 et seq. (1971) and other statutes criminalizing marijuana were unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. He also claimed the state failed to comply with a discovery order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of delivery of a controlled substance, marijuana. The court affirmed his conviction. Defendant claimed that the sentence for delivering marijuana was cruel and inhuman under the Eight Amendment but the court noted that was a matter for the legislature to decide. The classification of marijuana as a deadly narcotic did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as there was conflicting evidence regarding the toxicity of this substance. Defendant claimed that the information failed to advise him of the charges filed against him in violation of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 12 but the court found that defendant's offense was stated with such certainty as to have apprised him of the crime for which conviction was sought. The trial court's admission of polygraph evidence was not erroneous in the face of defendant's waiver in that regard. Defendant claimed that the State failed to prove that key evidence was not tampered with, but the court held that the State had met the chain of custody requirements by having presented evidence which strongly suggested the whereabouts of key exhibits at all times.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a verdict for defendants and the arrestee appealed. The court affirmed and held that: (1) it was not error to include the language of the statute in a jury instruction because statute was valid until it was later declared to be unconstitutional; (2) the subsequent declaration of invalidity of the statute upon which the arrest was based did not establish false imprisonment as a matter of law; and (3) the police officer was not required to demonstrate that probable cause existed for the arrest. The police officer proved his subjective, good faith belief that the statute he was enforcing was valid. He also proved that his belief was objectively reasonable.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Board appealed the circuit court judgment that held its assessment of property tax against the warehouse, a federally licensed warehouse which stored raw wheat belonging to farmers, other grain elevators, and itself, was an unreasonable classification that created an arbitrary and capricious assessment. The court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the Board did not waive its assigned errors, for the Board's brief grouped the issues addressed together but was sufficiently articulated to identify the issues. The warehouse used the Board's first regulation to calculate the &quot;true cash value&quot; of the property, and the Board asserted that a second regulation provided a basis of valuation that was uniform. While costs were a factor to consider in arriving at a just valuation, that factor alone was not enough to satisfy the constitutional requirements for assessing tax. The Board placed an artificial distinction and different valuation on the same raw grain than its regulations applied to that grain in the hands of the farmer. While the second regulation was to promote uniformity and equality, the resulting inequity of placing a different value on the same grain did not occur.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, convicted of theft after taking a signed blank check from the victims and cashing it, argued that the victim's in court identification was based on overly suggestive photo and lineup identifications in violation of U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, and a confrontation during which his attorney was not present, in violation of U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV, and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. The court first found that appellant had no right to counsel at the confrontation with the victim, because the right to counsel did not attach to pre-indictment identification procedures. The court then found that though the pretrial identifications may have been suggestive, the victim had ample opportunity to observe appellant while he was in her home. The court also found that the blank check was an instrument for purposes of the theft statute even though it was not negotiable.</SPAN></P>

The board denied her request for unemployment benefits and the court affirmed. The court held that: (1) parental obligations and transportation difficulties were not good cause justifying voluntary termination in connection with her work as required by Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 22-4-15-1; (2) the claimant's termination was not rendered involuntary by her compelling personal circumstances; and (3) a recent amendment to Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 22-4-15-1 did not manifest the legislature's intention to consider parental obligations as good cause. The court determined that it could not consider the claimants' allegation that termination was in connection with the work because it was caused by the unilateral shift change, due to the board's finding that she left her employment for subjective domestic obligations and transportation problems.</SPAN></P>

The State filed a motion for judgment on the bond forfeiture and the trial court entered judgment on the forfeiture. The surety filed a petition to rescind the judgment of forfeiture. The trial court granted the petition and ordered the State to return the amount of the bond to the surety. The court held that when the payment was in possession of the State, the funds had clearly accrued to the Common School Fund and could not properly be recovered by the surety. The surety argued that the procedure outlined in Ind. Code &sect; 35-4-5-12 (1971), for the forfeiture and recovery on bonds, operated to deprive a surety of due process of law. The court held that there was no due process violation. The surety was granted an opportunity at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner for a hearing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged a judgment of the LaGrange Circuit Court (Indiana), which convicted him of speeding and possession of burglary tools. Defendant was sentenced to serve two to 14 years on the possession of burglary tools count and was found not guilty of fleeing a police officer and of operating a vehicle without a driver's license upon motion of the State. Defendant's motion to correct errors as to the burglary tools conviction was overruled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A police officer saw defendant's car parked with its headlights on in an alley behind the town's business district. As the officer approached defendant's car, he fled and a high-speed car chase ensued. After defendant's car was stopped, an officer saw a butcher knife on the floor of the driver's side, two pry bars, a screwdriver and a small sledgehammer on the back seat. At trial, the passenger testified that defendant attempted to rob a pay telephone. Defendant was convicted of speeding and possession of burglary tools, a violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-13-8-1 (1971). On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erroneously admitted the State's evidence of his prior felony conviction, and that the evidence of conviction was insufficient. He also challenged the admission of the passenger's testimony and he argued that the evidence failed to prove his intent to commit burglary. The court held that the certified copy of the clerk's docket sheet, which showed his prior conviction of theft, was properly admissible. The court also held that there was ample evidence from which defendant's intent to commit burglary could be inferred and that the passenger's testimony was admissible.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did in fact possess the authority to issue a writ of prohibition to prevent the Commission from exceeding its quasi-judicial authority. The Commission also asserted that the trial court abused its discretion in actually issuing the injunction. The court determined that the Commission possessed the authority to suspend or revoke the permit, during a quasi-judicial hearing, after finding that the permit holder had engaged in the conduct with which he was charged. Therefore, the court concluded that the trial court improperly issued the injunction because it was based on an erroneous conclusion that the Commission had no jurisdiction to hear the charges against the permit holder.

The trial court's other findings against the mother were &quot;clearly sufficient&quot; in the court's view to sustain the trial court's judgment terminating the mother's parental rights and included neglect of the children's education. Further, the court rejected the mother's claim that the notice she had received of the termination hearing was constitutionally insufficient. The fact that the trial court had considered the factors enunciated in the Perkins case in reaching its decision was noted by the court. Finally, the court found that the finding that the children were neglected was supported by recurring instances of neglect stretching from the distant fast up until the time the children were removed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The friend asked the husband over to his place to help with a job on the friend's farm. After finishing the job, they drove into town in the friend's pickup and had a few beers. On the way home the friend drove off the road and into a culvert maintained by the county. The county had allowed weeds and grass to grow up so as to obscure the culvert from view. Plaintiffs contended that both the friend and the county were negligent in causing the husband's injury. The guest statute barred plaintiffs' recovery from the friend if the husband was a &quot;guest&quot; in the friend's pickup. The court held that there was evidence that the husband was a &quot;passenger for consideration.&quot; He was riding in the pickup in response to the friend's request for aid. Resolution of the issue on summary judgment was improper. The question of the county's liability was one of proximate cause. Was the county's failure to properly maintain the culvert a proximate cause of the husband's injury? The court held that where there was any reasonable doubt as to proximate cause, the issue was for the jury. Here, there was some doubt so that resolution of the issue on summary judgment was improper.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &quot;common nuisance&quot; under &sect; 35-24.1-4-3.5 required a showing of more than an isolated or casual instance of the prohibited activity. The court found that the evidence allowed the inference that the residence was being used for the prohibited purposes because a sample of the controlled substance was there, the sale took place there, and the seller discussed other controlled substances he was to be &quot;getting in&quot; in the future. The court held that defendant lacked standing to present his argument that &sect; 35-24.1-4-3.5 was unconstitutionally overbroad because the statute was constitutionally applied to him.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed an action and the trial court held that the program was unconstitutional and ordered the fee to be returned. The prosecutor sought review. The court affirmed in part. It found that the program was invalid because a prosecutor was limited to the powers specifically granted by the legislature. Because there was no statutory authority for the program, the prosecutor acted beyond his scope of authority. Because the program was unauthorized, the court declined to review its constitutionality.

The city filed the summary judgment motion based upon its affirmative defense of noncompliance with the notice statute, Ind. Code &sect; 18-2-2-1 (1971).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The victim was paralyzed and incapacitated as the result of a shooting by a city police officer.

The victim asserted that he was a minor at the time of the shooting and that formal notice of claim was served upon the city within 60 days of the date he attained his age of majority. The court reversed the order and remanded with instructions to sustain the city's motion for summary judgment. The court held that the trial court erred in concluding that the doctrine of in pari materia required that the Disability Statute, Ind. Code &sect; 34-1-2-5, and Ind. Code &sect; 18-2-2-1 be read together. The court found that express conflicts existed between the two statutes and that the doctrine of in pari materia did not apply in the instant action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the decision of the Montgomery Circuit Court (Indiana), which revoked his probation and imposed the balance of his sentence for possession of marijuana.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">While on probation, defendant was arrested for possession of marijuana, but the charges were dismissed. At a probation revocation hearing, he sought a preliminary hearing to suppress evidence. The motion was denied and his probation revoked. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that evidence inadmissible in a criminal proceeding was admissible in a probation revocation hearing and that no preliminary hearing was required. The court ruled that the exclusionary rule did not apply to such a hearing, absent evidence of police harassment or misconduct, because guilt was already determined and its concern was with defendant's rehabilitation and protection of society. The court found that the issue before the trial court was whether defendant violated the conditions of his probation, and that there was sufficient proof that he had used a controlled substance in violation of his conditions without a finding of guilty on the new charge. The court concluded that a condition that defendant conduct himself so that no one had any occasion to question whether he violated the law was so vague as to be unreasonable, but the revocation was proper on the controlled substance condition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city's ordinance was very similar to a state statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-30-1-1 (1971), which criminalized the keeping or frequenting of a house of ill repute. Two defendants were arrested for committing sexual acts in a massage parlor and the remaining defendant was arrested for owning or managing the parlor in which the acts occurred. After the judgments of conviction were entered, defendants appealed and asserted that the state law preempted the ordinance and that the ordinance was, therefore, unconstitutional. In reversing, the court held that a massage parlor could be considered a &quot;house of ill fame&quot; within the meaning of &sect; 35-30-1-1.Under Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 22, 23, the state legislature's action in enacting a general law defining a crime or a misdemeanor necessarily implied that there was no room for supplementary or complementary local legislation, even if the subject could otherwise be characterized as a &quot;municipal affair.&quot; An impermissible conflict existed between the city's ordinance and the state statute because the ordinance duplicated the subject matter of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgments of conviction and remanded the cause with instructions that the trial court should set the convictions aside.</SPAN></P>

R. Trial P. 50.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A bull escaped from a sale barn. In an attempt to capture the bull, a police officer fired two shots, one of which ricocheted off the bull's horn and struck a bystander in the stomach. The bystander brought a personal injury suit against the city, the officer, and the owner of the sale barn. The trial court dismissed the city from the suit and granted the officer's motion for a judgment on the evidence pursuant to Ind. R. Trial P. 50. On the bystander's appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Applying the strict standards of Rule 50, the court found sufficient conflict in the evidence to raise a jury question as to the officer's negligence, even though both the officer and the bystander testified as to the accident's unforeseeability. The court held that the bystander's failure to fulfill the notice requirements of Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18-2-2-1 did not entitle either the city or the officer to dismissal, because the city had actual notice of the accident and because the requirement did not apply to individual city employees. The court also ruled that a loan agreement between the bystander and the sale barn owner did not release the city and the officer as joint tortfeasors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Finding that the city was improperly dismissed from the bystander's personal injury suit, and that the officer was not entitled to a judgment on the evidence, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the superior court, finding from the evidence all of the elements of robbery as defined by Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-13-4-6 (1971). The court said any error in the admission of the companion's testimony that she was struck by defendant was harmless as the victim testified to the same facts. Finally, the court said that defendant's argument that &sect; 35-13-4-6 carried an unconstitutionally disproportionate penalty was waived on appeal pursuant to Ind. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The widower timely filed a petition for widow's allowance and family allowance subsequent to his wife's death. He argued that the statutes were unconstitutional in that the classifications based upon sex, which afforded different treatments to persons similarly situated, bore no reasonable relation to the purpose of the statutes. He therefore maintained that the statutes operated in derogation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Upholding the constitutionality of the statutes, the court stated that sex had not yet been determined a &quot;suspect classification&quot; so as to necessitate the application of the high scrutiny test in this equal protection case. The differing treatment of widows and widowers rested upon some ground of difference which bore a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, which was the reduction of disparity between the economic capabilities of a man and a woman. No constitutional infirmity was found in the challenged statutes.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was charged with second degree burglary, three counts of armed robbery, two counts of first degree burglary, theft of an automobile, theft, violation of probation, and attempted robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, who was a teen-ager, committed a series of criminal offenses over the course of several months. The superior court issued the ruling waiving juvenile jurisdiction, which subjected appellant to trial as an adult. A second waiver order was issued when new charges subsequently were filed against appellant. On appeal, the court held that the offenses under consideration had prosecutive merit, based upon the totality of the circumstances. Several offenses were felonies and some were of heinous nature. The court also ruled that the superior court did not abuse its discretion when it granted waiver. Balancing the best interests of the child and those of society, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-5-7-1 (1971), the superior court properly considered the serious nature of the offenses, the repetitive patterns, appellant's lack of susceptibility to rehabilitation under the juvenile system, and the need to protect public security.

After the detective was admitted into a residence, he observed marijuana in plain view. He then phoned a police captain and told him to get a search warrant. A subsequent search of the resident procured large quantities of marijuana. Thereafter, defendant was convicted of delivery of a controlled substance and sentenced to five years imprisonment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that because the entry was made for the purpose of making a warrantless arrest, rather than to make a warrantless search of the premises, the entry and arrest of defendant by the detective was constitutional and valid. Further, any subsequent seizure of property in plain view was also lawful. Probable cause exited for defendant's warrantless arrest because the detective had personal knowledge that a felony was being committed. Moreover, the search warrant was valid because where police-channel communications existed, and the arresting officer acted in good faith thereon, the existence of probable cause could be determined on the basis of collective information known to the law enforcement organization.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A bail bond schedule and court order was previously promulgated that gave criminal defendants the choice of posting bail bonds by either surety bonds, a property bond, a full cash bond, or a cash deposit of 10 percent of the bond set out in the schedule. The surety thereafter posted on behalf of another 10 percent cash deposit. The clerk of court thereafter refunded 90 percent of the deposit to the surety's attorney and retained 10 percent pursuant to the court order. The surety filed an action on behalf of herself and all others who posted 10 percent cash deposit bonds to recover all amounts posted under authority of the court order on the ground that the withholding of funds was illegal, unlawful, arbitrary and capricious, and unconstitutional. The court reversed, holding that the 10 percent fee retained by the clerk was not an assessment of costs and was not retained to reimburse the State for the expenses of prosecution, but was merely an administrative fee imposed upon those seeking the benefit of the 10 percent cash deposit provision in lieu of posting one of the other types of bonds.

The court held that &quot;great bodily harm&quot; had been adequately judicially defined for the purposes of the aggravated assault statute and was generally a question of fact for the jury. Thus, there was no unconstitutional want of distinction from ordinary assault and battery, nor was it necessary for the court to set forth what it might determine to be concrete distinctions between the two offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff patient appealed a judgment of the Marion Superior Court No. Three (Indiana), which had granted a motion filed under Ind. R. Trial P. 12(B)(6) by defendant eye doctors to dismiss the patient's medical malpractice complaint against them for the loss of the sight in his right eye. The trial court had held that the patient's complaint was time barred by the Malpractice Statute of Limitations, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-4-19-1 (1973) (Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">One of the doctors had allegedly operated on the patient and caused him to lose sight in one eye. That doctor then allegedly told him that he had glaucoma and that he would eventually lose the sight in his other eye. The patient sought a second opinion from another eye doctor, who allegedly told him the same thing. When the patient sought a third opinion, many years later, the third doctor, who was not a party to this action, advised him that he did not have glaucoma. That doctor stated that if he had been consulted earlier, he might have been able to restore the patient's sight. On appeal, the court noted that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-1-2-9 (1973), which provided for a tolling of statutes of limitations in cases involving fraudulent concealment, did not apply to the Act. However, the court held that under principles of equity the doctors could not avail themselves of the Act if they had fraudulently concealed their malpractice from the patient and their comments had misled him into thinking that seeking a third opinion would not help. The court also held that the fact that their physician-patient relationship had ended many years before did not affect the patient's equitable right.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's judgment, which had dismissed the patient's medical malpractice complaint against the eye doctors as time-barred by the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant employee was awarded temporary total disability under the Indiana Workmen's Compensation Act. Three years after the termination of benefits, the employee filed a second application for review alleging that his disability had recurred and increased. The full Industrial Board of Indiana dismissed the application because it was not filed within one year from the last date for which compensation was paid. The employee sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court considered whether the employee's application for review was filed within the applicable limitations period. The employee argued that the one-year limitation was not applicable, maintaining that he filed within the permissible two-year period. Finding that the employee's application did not fall within either limitations period, the court affirmed. According to &sect; 45 of the Act, an application for modification could not be filed after the expiration of two years from the last day for which compensation was paid under the original award. The court held that an additional 50 weeks of payments, awarded pursuant to a first application for modification, could not be tacked onto the original award because &sect; 45 was unambiguous and did not allow such action. Section 45 also barred applications unless filed within one year from the last date for which compensation was paid. Although successive awards could be tacked on, the court found that an initial 26 weeks of permanent partial disability could not be added to the award because these weeks of payments coincided with the compensation for temporary total disability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant taxpayer's complaint sought a declaratory judgment that the Indiana Regional Planning Act was unconstitutional. The Lake Superior Court (Indiana) entered judgment in favor of appellees, a regional transportation and planning commission and its executive director, granting their motion to dismiss and overruling the taxpayer's motion to correct errors. The taxpayer challenged the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In affirming the decision in favor of the commission, the court noted that the title to the original Indiana Regional Planning Act stated that the Act embraced the creation, organization, powers, and duties of a regional planning commission. That title was sufficient to give notice that the Act enabled entities such as the county regional transportation and planning commission to own and operate a mass transit system. Thus, the Act was not unconstitutional as including provisions not within limitations of title. Further, the Act was not unconstitutional as embracing more than one subject because it covered both regional planning and operation of a mass transit system, in light of a relationship of the two functions to the Act's purpose of creating an entity to plan and implement solutions to regional problems. Moreover, a judgment dismissing the amended complaint because it stated a new and different cause of action from that stated in the original complaint was affirmed due to the taxpayer's failure to bring before the court an original complaint filed in cause.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. Reversal could be obtained only upon a showing that the evidence was without conflict and led to but one reasonable conclusion and that the trial court reached the opposite conclusion. The evidence failed to meet the test of strong and convincing proof needed to overcome the presumption of the adequacy of counsel. The trial court could have reasonably rejected the claim regarding shackles because there was conflicting testimony as to whether defendant appeared wearing shackles. Under Ind. R. Crim. P. 4(A), there was no speedy trial violation because the six-month period began to run anew from each delay chargeable to defendant. The overbreadth and vagueness assertions were waived by authority of Ind. R. App. P. 8.3(A)(7) because defendant failed to provide citations or references to the wording found offensive.

Moreover, the court held federal supervision of wholesale power transfers had not preempted the commission from allocating a portion of appellee's interconnection plant to the rate base. Furthermore, the court held substantial evidence had supported findings concerning the &quot;used and useful&quot; status of the interconnection plant and the adoption of a &quot;supervised expense&quot; method of common plant allocation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants appealed their convictions by the Washington Circuit Court (Indiana) on two counts of conspiracy to commit a felony, to-wit, burglary, for attempting to break into a bank and a drug store. Defendants asserted on appeal that their being charged with, tried for, and convicted of two separate conspiracies was contrary to Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-111-1 (1971), Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14, and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants were observed by two police officers as they unsuccessfully attempted to gain entry into a bank and then a nearby drug store. The trial court convicted them of separate conspiracies, and the court affirmed, finding no error in the procedure of charging defendants with two violations of Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-111-1. The ultimate question of whether defendants' acts constituted a single conspiracy to commit two burglaries or whether the acts constituted two separate conspiracies to commit separate burglaries was a matter to be resolved by the trier of fact, and where, as in the case at bar, reasonable men could differ on that question, it was not within the province of the court to substitute its judgment for that of the fact finder. The court also held that where separate criminal offenses were committed in succession, it was not contrary to the concept of double jeopardy to charge, try, and convict for both offenses. Defendants' assertion that &sect; 35-1-111-1 was unconstitutional was without merit. However, the court modified defendants' sentences, as the trial court erred in not giving defendants credit for pre-conviction incarceration time under Ind. Code &sect; 35-8-2.5-1 (1971).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed and remanded with instructions to modify defendants' sentences to account for pre-conviction incarceration time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Department assumed the duties of the Indianapolis Mass Transportation Authority. The City alleged that in 1967 the Auditor improperly distributed the proceeds from the Fund to the Authority and subsequently to the Department. The court affirmed the superior court's decision. The Cigarette Tax Act, 1947 Ind. Acts, ch. 222, levied a tax on the sale of cigarettes. The 1967 amendment of the Act, Ind. Acts, ch. 296 (Amendment), appropriated to the Marion County Capital Improvement Board of Managers (Indiana) and to the Marion County Metropolitan Thoroughfare Authority all of the cigarette tax fund money that would have been distributed to the Indianapolis Cumulative Capital Improvement Fund. The Amendment did not affect the distribution of the funds to any other city or town. The Indiana Mass Transportation Authority Act, 1967 Ind. Acts, ch. 311, provided that any of the fund that was used for the distribution to the cities was to have been paid to the Authority. The Amendment and the Act were not conflicting. Where the language of a statute was clear, there was no room for construction. The Amendment and the Act did not contain constitutional defects.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that the notice requirements did not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23. The court could not say that the classification of governmental tortfeasors as different from private tortfeasors had no reasonable basis. Although the city might have had actual notice of the victim's injuries, the victim had not substantially complied with the tort claims statute in giving notice of her claim. Because the victim had not previously shown that she was unable to give notice because of her physical condition, the court found that she could not raise the issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The county contended inter alia that it was immune from tort liability, and that certain jury instructions were improper. The court held that: (1) sovereign immunity did not apply to ministerial duties and the maintenance of the already erected sign was a ministerial duty; (2) the jury instruction on the county's statutory duty pertaining to traffic control signs did not amount to a negligence per se charge because the jury was further instructed to determine if the county exercised reasonable care; and (3) it was not error to instruct the jury that the county had constructive notice of the dangerous intersection if the county could have discovered the dangerous condition had they used reasonable diligence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In her belated appeal, defendant sought review of a judgment of the Marion Criminal Court (Indiana), which convicted her of attempting to procure a miscarriage (abortion), a violation of Ind. Ann. Stat. &sect; 10-105 (Burns 1956), the Abortion Statute. On appeal, she contended that the statute was unconstitutional and that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1967, a pregnant woman went to a hotel room with a friend and met defendant and an abortionist there for the purpose of obtaining an abortion for money. The abortionist inserted a clamp in the woman's body and scraped out her uterus, dislodging the fetus. While the abortion was being performed, defendant held a light for the abortionist. The woman's friend testified that defendant made all the arrangements. The trial court convicted her, and, in 1973, she filed this belated appeal, claiming, in part, that &sect; 10-105 was unconstitutional because the U.S. Supreme Court, in Roe v. Wade, had held a similar statute unconstitutional. On appeal, the court found that she did not properly raise the issue on appeal as required by Ind. R. Trial P. 59(B), (G). She did not indicate what specific constitutional provision &sect; 10-105 violated or accompany her claim with a statement of facts and grounds upon which it was based. Her assertion that &sect; 10-105 &quot;on its face, was an unconstitutional invasion into the private affairs of citizens,&quot; was not supported by a statement as to how or why it invaded private affairs of citizens or herself. Also, the evidence was sufficient to support her conviction.</SPAN></P>

The wife contended that the trial court's decision was not sustained by sufficient evidence, that the Dissolution of Marriage Act was unconstitutional, that the parties' antenuptial agreement was inadmissible, and that the wife should have been awarded attorney's fees for her appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court rejected the wife's contention that dissolution of marriage had to be supported by objective evidence of an irretrievable breakdown. The key issue was whether a reasonable possibility of reconciliation existed based on a consideration of the marriage as a whole. Any evidence that had a bearing upon the marriage's viability was admissible whether it was objective or subjective. The court found that the Indiana Dissolution of Marriage Act, Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-11.5-1 et seq. (Supp. 1975) was constitutional because there was no constitutional provision protecting marriage from legislative control. The court found that the parties' antenuptial agreement was properly admitted into evidence. Such agreements were favored under Ind. Code &sect; 31-1-11.5-10 (Supp. 1975), and the wife had failed to establish that the agreement was invalid. The husband did not waive the agreement's provisions by asking the trial court to exercise its discretion to make an order for the disposition of the parties' property. The court affirmed the trial court's order in its entirety, finding that it did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award the wife attorney's fees for her appeal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal of the denial of his petition for post-conviction relief as to sentencing, the prisoner contended that his minimum sentence should have been reduced to a term of five years because the minimum sentence for the greater offense of armed felony was so reduced three days before his sentencing. The court held that the modification of the prisoner's sentence to an indeterminate term of not less than 10 years' nor more than 20 years' imprisonment was proper because this was the punishment that was proper at the time the crime was committed. The court held that the legislative intent was clear that this was the punishment that the legislature intended for application until such time as the amended sentence could constitutionally be imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants appealed the decisions by the Putnam Circuit Court (Indiana), which convicted defendants of theft, a violation of Ind. Ann. Stat. &sect; 10-3030(1)(a) (Supp. 1974), and visiting a common nuisance, a violation Ind. Code &sect; 16-6-8-7 (1971). The trial court denied defendants' motion to dismiss the information filed for maintaining a common nuisance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants argued that the trial court erred in overruling their motion to dismiss the information charging defendants with maintaining a common nuisance. The court stated that because the State failed to amend the information pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-3.1-1-5 (1971), it was required to be assumed that the State intended to charge defendants with &quot;keeping a common nuisance&quot; and no more. Defendants based their defense on this charge, even to the point of calling a witness to show ownership of the truck and its contents. Such evidence would be irrelevant if defendants were defending against the charge of &quot;visiting a common nuisance,&quot; but it could be highly relevant in a charge of &quot;maintaining a common nuisance&quot; where control over the property was an important part of the crime. When defendants were found guilty of a crime for which they were not charged, i.e., &quot;visiting a common nuisance,&quot; their substantial rights were impaired, and thus the convictions on these charges could not stand. There was insufficient evidence to sustain defendant two's and three's theft conviction because there was no evidence that these defendants did anything to aid or abet the larceny of the gasoline.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed defendant one's theft conviction. The court reversed defendant two's and defendant three's theft convictions. The court reversed the visiting a common nuisance convictions for all defendants.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 34-4-10-1 et seq. (1971), and Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 18-5-10-24, 18-5-10-32 (1971).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The taxpayers brought an action for a declaratory judgment and mandate challenging the town's annexation of an eight acre tract that was zoned for multi-family dwellings. The trial court entered an order granting defendants' motion to dismiss the action. On appeal, the court reversed the order in part, and affirmed it in part. The court held that: (1) the action for mandate under Ind. Code &sect; 34-1-58-1 (1971) was properly dismissed because the taxpayers did not seek to prosecute it in the name of the state on relation of the party in interest; (2) the taxpayers were not proper remonstrators under Ind.

Code &sect; 18-5-10-32 (1971). The court held that the taxpayers' &sect; 18-5-10-32 claim alleged sufficient facts to survive a motion to dismiss under Ind. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in giving two jury instructions because the statute upon which they were based, Ind. Code &sect; 16-6-8-10 (1971), was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant asserted that the statute permitted discretion in determining whether to impose punishment as a felony or as a misdemeanor without providing sufficient guidelines for the exercise of the discretion. On appeal, the court held that defendant lacked standing to raise the issue. Only a person who had been adversely affected by the asserted unconstitutionality could properly challenge the constitutionality of a statute. Section 16-6-8-10 required a sentencing court to sentence a defendant to 1 to 10 years' imprisonment, but it gave the sentencing court discretion to sentence a defendant to anywhere from 30 days to one year upon his first offense. Defendant's conviction was treated as a misdemeanor, and he was sentenced to a term of 180 days. Because he was sentenced under the lesser of the two alternatives provided by the statute, he could not show injury and could not challenge constitutionality of the statute.</SPAN></P>

A wrongful death complaint was filed in the name of the father and the mother alleging the death was the result of the physician's failure to diagnose and treat his injuries. The mother appealed the trial court's ruling dismissing her as a plaintiff pursuant to Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 34-1-1-8 (1971), which only allowed the father to bring a wrongful death action unless the mother showed the father was dead, had deserted his family, or was imprisoned. The mother contended that &sect; 34-1-1-8 violated her constitutionally protected equal protection rights because there was no rational basis for the difference in treatment of a father and mother. The physician argued the rational basis for the distinction was the prevention of a double recovery and was because the father had the primary right to the child's services. The court found the statute was constitutionally defective because it arbitrarily precluded the mother from being able to prove her rights and duties as to the child.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The 1970 Decennial Census established the official population of an Individual city at just over 5000 people, the first time that city exceeded 5000. Pursuant to Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 7-1-4-6, three citizens, including the applicant, sought a permit to operate a package liquor store in the city. The Commission found that two of the citizens were personally qualified to own and operate a package liquor store but the applicant was not. The Commission also found that although it did have the authority to issue another package store permit because of the census figure, because there were 10 retail alcoholic beverage outlets in the city, it was not in the public interest to do so. Thus, the Commission denied all three applications. Applicant appealed this decision to the trial court. The court held that by the provisions of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 7-1-4-6, the legislature intended to place a ceiling on, but not a floor under, the number of permits that could be issued in a given population classification.

The salon proprietor was ordered to open the cash register, and defendant made sexual advances to an attendant. Defendant entered a waiting car driven by an accomplice. Prior to giving a full confession, defendant was fully informed of his constitutional rights. Defendant agreed to take police to where he had discarded his gun. The trial court convicted defendant and denied his motion to correct errors. Affirming, the court held that there was sufficient evidence to support the admission of defendant's confession. In view of the extensive warnings given to defendant and his failure to point to any promises made to him, other than a vague promise of help from a deputy prosecutor, the court could only conclude that the confession was voluntary. A proper chain of custody was established for the admission of money and bullets; an absolutely perfect chain of custody was not required. The armed robbery statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-12-1-1 (1971), was constitutional, and it was not arbitrarily imposed against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The inmate failed to raise his denial of counsel in his motion for a new trial, in his petition for post-conviction relief, at his hearing on the petition, or in his belated motion to correct errors. The inmate asserted that a 10-20 year indeterminate sentence for the greater offense of armed robbery, Ind. Code &sect; 35-12-1-1 (1971), could allow a defendant to be released at an earlier time. In affirming the decision of the trial court, the court deemed defendant's deprivation of counsel argument waived pursuant to Ind. R. Trial P. 59(G). Waiver was caused by the inmate's failure to preserve the issue in his original motion for a new trial or his belated motion to correct errors.

Claiming that he first learned of the physician's failure to properly diagnose his condition on June 7, 1970, the patient filed a medical malpractice action on June 6, 1972. The trial court concluded that the patient's action was barred by the two year statute of limitations, Ind. Code &sect; 34-4-19-1 (1971), and granted the physician's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed and ruled that the statute commenced to run when the patient learned of the malpractice or information that would lead to discovery of the malpractice by the exercise of diligence. The court determined that the evidence most favorable to the patient established that at some time prior to June 6, 1970, the patient became aware of the continuing nature of his problem and that the physician was not providing proper treatment. The court concluded that the statute was triggered at that time because, when the patient knew or concluded that something was wrong, he was chargeable as a matter of law with the additional knowledge he would have procured had he exercised diligence to discover it.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant failed to properly preserve the assertion that the pre-trial identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, in that he did not object to the victim's identification testimony at trial. Further, the court found that the State proved that defendant forced the prosecutrix to submit to anal intercourse. The court held that while there was no evidence that the accused personally took anything, there was evidence that his companion took money from the victim's purse. Further, the court held that defendant's conversations with his companion leading up to the discovery and seizure of the money made it clear that the two acted in concert.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant Inheritance Tax Division of the Indiana Department of Revenue sought review of a judgment of the Boone Superior Court (Indiana), which held that life insurance proceeds paid to the co-trustees of an inter vivos trust for purposes of satisfying claims against the decedent's estate were not subject to the Indiana inheritance tax under Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Prior to his death, the decedent established an inter vivos trust that was to be funded primarily by the proceeds of life insurance policies. The trust gave the co-trustees the discretionary power to utilize the trust estate's net income and principal to satisfy the expenses of the decedent's last illness, funeral, interment, and any taxes that were properly chargeable against his estate. The trial court held that the life insurance proceeds were not transferred to the trustees in such a manner as to be subject to Indiana inheritance tax. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's decision. Section 6-4-1-1 clearly provided that the proceeds were not taxable unless they were payable in such a manner as to be subject to both claims against the decedent's estate and distribution as a part of the decedent's estate. By designating the co-trustees as beneficiaries of the life insurance policies and transferring ownership of the policies to the trustees, the decedent precluded the proceeds from being subject to distribution as a part of his estate. Neither a provision in the decedent's will nor intestate succession could operate to divest the trustees of their claim to the proceeds.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's argument and held that the State's evidence in chief made a prima facie case and the trial court correctly overruled the motion for a directed verdict. Additionally, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. However, with regard to defendant's conviction for reckless homicide, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction. The court noted that while evidence that defendant was driving while intoxicated in conjunction with other evidence that he was driving in a dangerous manner might have been sufficient to sustain the conviction, there was no evidence that defendant's conduct was sufficiently reckless. The court said that the fact that defendant crossed the center line and that he was intoxicated were not sufficient to constitute reckless homicide.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant inmate appealed from a judgment of the Marion Criminal Court, Division One (Indiana), which denied his petition for post-conviction relief in which he contended that his indeterminate sentence was being unconstitutionally held in abeyance pending service of his original life sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">While on parole from a life sentence for murder, the inmate was convicted of assault and battery with intent to kill and sentenced to two to 14 years. After the inmate arrived at prison, the parole board determined, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 11-1-1-11 (1971), that he should serve his original life sentence before beginning service on his new indeterminate sentence. The inmate sought post-conviction relief on the ground that &sect; 11-1-1-11's application to a person on parole from a life sentence was unconstitutional. On appeal from the denial of the inmate's petition, the court found the inmate's constitutional arguments to be without merit. The parole board's determination did not fall within the constitutional prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishments, as the prohibitions applied only when a criminal penalty was not graduated and proportioned to the nature of an offense or where it was grossly and unquestionably excessive. The inmate's equal protection argument failed because he was not treated differently than any other inmate who fell within the scope of the statute. The fact that the inmate's original sentence was a life sentence did not bar the application of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, which denied post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence clearly established that the house in which defendants were arrested was a common nuisance as defined by the statute. As shown by the marijuana found during a search of the house, the house was being used for the purpose of illegally keeping a dangerous drug. The court held that substantial evidence of probative value was presented as to each defendant sufficient to establish that they possessed the requisite knowledge that the house was used for illegal purposes. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague, noting that an ordinary man would have fair notice of the particular act prohibited by the statute. In addition, the court held that the punishment imposed by the trial court was within the framework of the statute and was not severe.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to convict him for entering with intent to commit a felony because he never entered the building, but only that he leaned into the building through the window. The court disagreed and held that a showing that defendant leaned through a window to enable him to take money from the jukebox was sufficient to establish the element of entry. The court ruled that evidence was sufficient to support the determination that defendant was not too intoxicated to form a criminal intent where he broke through a plate glass window by throwing a brick against it, and then used his cane to clear away the loose glass so that he would be able to lean into the room.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-2-1-1 (1971) required the driver to file the notice with the county. Without the notice, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hear the claim under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-2-1-4 (1971). The county could not waive its right to complain of the failure to give notice because the lack of subject matter jurisdiction could not be waived and could be raised at any point during the action. The driver failed to file any written notice, and service of process and discovery undertaken by the county did not eliminate the necessity of a formal notice. No exigent circumstances relived the driver from strict compliance with Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17-2-1-1 (1971), which had been upheld as constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 35-332H (Supp. 1972)) was unconstitutional because one could be convicted of a sale of dangerous drugs even though there was no act that amounted to a transfer of narcotics. The court held that under the statute, any offer was alone sufficient to constitute a violation. The court further determined that a reasonable construction of the statute was possible and the language of the statute was reasonable in light of the object to be attained. The purpose in considering an offer a violation was to interrupt or prevent the initial transfer of drugs from a pusher to the buyer. The court concluded that defendant failed in his burden of showing the unconstitutionality of the statute.

The homeowner heard a commotion and observed an automobile stuck in her yard, followed by two figures getting into a medium sized, dark colored car, which was driven away. Items in and around the car, in plain view, were from the store. The registration inside the glove box revealed that the car belonged to defendant's sister. Later that evening, a dark colored car occupied by three persons drove slowly by the abandoned car sat. Police gave chase and stopped the car.

In affirming, the court stated that defendant's speedy trial right. Trial within 50 days as required by Ind. R. Crim. P. 4(B) was excused because the trial court's docket was congested. Trial was postponed for one day.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that the Habitual Traffic Offenders Statute was unconstitutional as an ex post facto law, bill of attainder, and imposed double jeopardy. The court held that the statute was not a bill of attainder, an ex post facto law, nor did it impose double jeopardy. The court noted that the supreme court had previously rejected the argument that the Act was an ex post facto law. Defendant argued that the statute placed her in double jeopardy because she had previously received a penalty for the offense that triggered the action. The court held that the operation of the statute was not a punishment as a result of a criminal proceeding, but rather an exercise of the police power for the protection of the public. Defendant did not receive increased punishment for the previous convictions, but automatically fell into a class of persons prohibited from driving on the public highways for the protection of the public. Defendant finally contended that the statute constituted an unconstitutional bill of attainder. The court noted that bills of attainder inflicted punishment without trial, whereas the statute's intent was purely regulatory, not punitive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The distributor filed an against defendants for a judgment declaring unconstitutional a City ordinance defining &quot;pornographic materials&quot; and restricting minors from the premises of a retail establishment selling or displaying such materials. The distributor alleged that the City ordinance violated his free press and property rights as a wholesale distributor. The trial court dismissed the action, ruling that the enforcement of the ordinance would not have limit any of his legal rights in such a manner that he was entitled to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the distributor had an interest sufficient to give him standing to challenge the allegedly inhibitory ordinance. The distributor was suing on behalf of himself to protect his own claim to a First Amendment right to distribute magazines. That claim gave him standing to contest the validity of the ordinance, as it affected him, and to ask the court to restrain the City from threatening to enforce it against his retailers, regardless of whether it would have been ultimately determined that the ordinance was valid or that the magazines were obscene.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner's application for post-conviction relief attacked his sentence on constitutional and statutory grounds. Following a post-conviction relief hearing, the trial court corrected, nunc pro tunc, the sentence to an indeterminate sentence of not less than 10 or more than 20 years, and ruled against petitioner on all other issues. Petitioner sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the modified sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. In this respect, the court rejected petitioner's argument that the modified sentence was invalid because it was harsher than a determinate sentence for armed robbery, which was a greater offense than robbery. Next, the court held that the sentence imposed was not error. In this respect, the court noted that petitioner's contention that rendition of any sentence under an &quot;unconstitutional&quot; statute, that is, &sect; 35-13-4-6, constituted error had been recently rejected.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the &quot;good time&quot; statutes, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 11-7-6-1 and 11-7-7-1 (1971), as they applied to indeterminate sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal from the denial of his post-conviction petition, appellant raised a constitutional issue by pointing out the unfairness of the application of the &quot;good time&quot; statutes, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 11-7-6-1 and 11-7-7-1 (1971), to indeterminate sentences. He emphasized that a person who served a five-year determinate sentence with good time off would have been entitled to discharge after serving three years and nine months. While a person such as appellant, who had to serve a one to five-year indeterminate sentence was ineligible for discharge after three years and nine months, but could have only received parole consideration. The court held that appellant failed to preserve his constitutional argument for consideration. His motion to correct errors asserted only the alleged erroneous findings of the trial court and completely omitted any reference to the unconstitutionality of the operation of the good time statutes. The court concluded that even if appellant had preserved his constitutional question it would have been of no avail. The good time statutes were constitutional and the denial of appellant's effort to obtain a premature discharge under his indeterminate sentence was proper.</SPAN></P>

As a result, she was convicted of theft by deception. She appealed. The court affirmed the conviction. Appellant's claim that she should have been charged under the welfare fraud statutes rather than the general theft statutes was a challenge to the indictment. Thus, it was waived because she did not challenge the sufficiency of the indictment prior to trial. The state was not required to prosecute appellant under the more specific statute or under the statute that carried the lesser penalty. The state welfare regulation forming the basis of appellant's conviction was invalid only to the extent that it conflicted with the federal law governing aid to dependent children. However, the continued absence regulation remained viable. The appellant's husband did not satisfy the continued absence requirement in order to qualify appellant for welfare benefits. Appellant's failure to notify the department that her husband was living with her was a deceptive act, within the meaning of Ind. Code &sect; 35-17-5-13 (1971), and thus a criminal act under Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the landowners asserted that the Commission failed to follow its rules of procedure pertaining to rezoning when it recommended the adoption of the ordinance. The rules of procedure listed factors to be considered on rezoning applications, including the effect on adjacent property, topography, and increased demands on streets and utilities. Evidence was presented to the Commission in support of the rezoning relating to the projected location of a lumber yard that was to be built upon the property; to the need for rezoning, topography information; and to projected demands to be made on streets and utilities. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the evidence presented was sufficient, though every factor was not addressed. With regard to the landowners' assertion that the rezoning was illegal as it affected them, the court held that although the value of the landowners' property might have been slightly diminished by the rezoning, it was not illegal. The depreciation in value to private property as a result of the passage of a zoning ordinance, which was for the general welfare, health, or safety, was not a ground for unconstitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the term &quot;narcotics&quot; was a generic term applicable to various addiction-forming or addiction-sustaining drugs. Further, the Act limited contraband narcotics to the drugs specifically listed and other non-enumerated drugs chemically identifiable with them and other similar drugs which could appear on a list issued by the Indiana Board of Pharmacy. The court rules that methadone, as described in the testimony, obviously did not fit into either of those two categories. Thus, the court held that the State was obliged to go further with its proof in order to provide an evidentiary basis from which the trial court could find that defendant possessed a narcotic drug within the meaning of the Act. The court held that the State failed to provide such a basis. Lastly, the court held that it was apparent that the attempted incorporation by the State statute of certain sections of federal law failed because it did not meet the requisite standard of specificity as to which sections were sought to be incorporated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff grandfather brought a parental negligence suit against defendant parents. Sustaining a motion to dismiss, the trial court ruled that the parents were immune from suit and that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The grandfather challenged a judgment of the Fountain Circuit Court (Indiana), overruling his motion to correct errors seeking an abrogation of the doctrine of parental immunity in Indiana.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parents' son received head injuries while visiting a cemetery with his parents. On appeal, the grandfather raised three challenges to the doctrine of parental immunity in Indiana. The grandfather alleged that the case that acted as the progenitor of parental immunity was judicially unsound because it was not based on statute or on English common law. The grandfather pointed out that interspousal immunity had been abrogated. The court noted the reasons on which interspousal immunity had lost its validity but found that much reason existed for the continuance of parental control without civil redress during a child's minority. Failure to supervise was not a sufficient circumstance to overcome parental immunity. The grandfather then argued that the doctrine was an unconstitutional denial of equal protection and a denial of access to the courts. The court rejected that argument because there were legitimate reasons, such as unity of interest of parent and child and lack of a truly adversary situation, which supported parental immunity. Thus, parental immunity was not arbitrary or without a rational basis as a mater of law. Further, the doctrine was not judicially unsound.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the justice contended that there was no legal requirement that a justice of the peace reside in the township as such an official was a judicial officer and not a township officer. The justice also argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the finding that he removed his residence from the township. On the other hand, the trustee maintained that a justice of the peace was a township officer within the meaning of Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 6 and pursuant thereto was required to reside within the county. Finding dicta in four cases persuasive in stating that justices of the peace were township officers and finding the justice's arguments unpersuasive, the court held that there was nothing in &sect; 6 to suggest that it applied only to constitutionally-created offices and not to judicial officers. Moreover, defendant's retention of an office in the county, while he and his family moved their domicile to an adjoining township presented sufficient evidence to warrant an inference that he changed his residence, and whether his explanation of a temporary sojourn in the adjoining county carried sufficient weight to overcome the inference was solely for the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the inmate failed in his burden of proof to show that trial counsel did not properly represent him. The court held that the inmate's protestation of innocence subsequent to his plea of guilty was insufficient to set aside the plea when the evidence clearly supported the trial court's decision to accept the plea presented at trial. The trial court erred when it granted summary disposition on the guilty plea issue by not holding a hearing on the petition, as required by Ind. R. P.

Ann. &sect; 28-5314(1970) provided that schools were required to provide temporary aid to families who were unable to pay the book rental fees, and that the school corporation had provided an &quot;Inability to Pay&quot; form, but that neither the student nor other members of the class had applied for or been denied assistance. The court concluded that the student failed to meet her heavy burden of overcoming the presumption of the constitutionality of the long-standing legislative policy permitting the challenged fees.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, which upheld the state's statute permitting public schools to charge rental fees for textbooks.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, members of a metropolitan board of zoning appeals, challenged the judgment of the Marion County Superior Court (Indiana), which found in favor of appellee landowner by reversing the board's denial of the landowner's petition for a zoning variance. The board argued that the trial court's judgment was beyond the permissible scope of judicial review and that the judgment was contrary to the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The landowner filed a petition for a zoning variance in order to construct a neighborhood convenience shopping facility in a residential zone. The board denied the petition, and the landowner filed an action for judicial review contending that the board's denial restricted its beneficial use of its property such that it constituted a taking without just compensation in violation of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 21 and 23 and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The trial court reversed the board's denial, and the board appealed. The court affirmed, holding that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's findings. The trial court did not rely on a judicial review of the statutory determinates, but on the unconstitutional application of the zoning restrictions to the particular piece of property. The commercial proliferation of the area by the granting of variances had so changed its character that the zoning restrictions placed on it were no longer realistic or meaningful. Accordingly, the meaningless, useless, and distorted zoning profile denied any reasonable use to the landowner and constituted an unconstitutional deprivation of its property.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that the truth or falsity of the television segment in question could be of no consequence in making a decision as to whether a prior restraint was permissible. An injunction was not permitted simply because the publication would be false. The segment in question was a matter of public interest. A prior restraint was not permissible for either a publication or a republication of a statement of public interest. Where publications were made which violated the First Amendment freedoms the states afforded proper redress for injured parties in the form of defamation or libel actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The mortgagee challenged the constitutionality of a statute that required only an owner to be given notice of a tax sale. She alleged that she did not have notice that certain mortgaged property was being sold. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision quieting title to the property in the purchaser. The court found that the basis for the appeal regarded whether the mortgagee was in fact given notice. The court concluded that the record in the case was insufficient for such a determination because there was no complete record of the evidence given at trial. The mortgagee had not testified that she had not received notice. The court added that the mortgagee, as the appellant, had the burden of including all of the evidence in the record. Without the evidence, the court could not determine whether the purchaser proved that actual notice was given. If the mortgagee did receive actual notice, then she had no standing to contest the constitutionality of the statute. Because the mortgagee's evidentiary argument failed, the court was not required to decide the constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant sought review of an order of the Elkhart Circuit Court (Indiana), which dismissed his petition for a restricted driver's license under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 9-5-2-1 et seq. (1971) . Appellee county sheriff filed a motion to dismiss asserting that the petition was not verified and appellant was not a resident. Defendant commissioner of motor vehicles filed a similar motion asserting that appellant's driver's license had not been suspended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court noted that appellant's statement of facts and grounds in support of his motion asserted that the he was denied equal protection under the law of the State of Indiana without indicating what specific law or laws of Indiana he complained of, how such laws denied equal protection, or how he was injuriously affected. The court held that the assignment was inadequate to present an issue for review. Under the existing case authority, the jurisdictional requirements for a restricted driver's license was that the petitioner's current driving license had been suspended and that the petition was verified. The court observed that appellant's petition was not verified, nor was it alleged that his license had been suspended. The court reasoned that, even assuming that the restricted driver's license statute could be challenged on an equal protection theory, appellant had shown no injury enabling him to assert the issue. Because appellant conceded that his Ohio license had not been suspended, he was not a member of the class whose rights might allegedly be infringed upon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The return on service of summons showed that a copy of the complaint and summons was delivered to two defendants and a copy was left with one defendant for the third defendant. No appearance was entered for defendant and after proof of service a default decree was issued. In affirming, the court found that there was no justification for defendants in letting the appearance date pass without their attention. The neglect, whether on the part of defendants or their original attorney, was not shown to have been excusable neglect. Nor could the litigation have been termed as a surprise to defendants or their attorney because their original attorney had suggested in his correspondence to plaintiffs that a distinct possibility of legal action existed if settlement was not reached. The record did not support defendants' suggestion of a conflict of interest on the part of plaintiffs' counsel. Statutes dealing with a legal survey were not germane to the issues of the case. Defendants' abstract claims of unconstitutionality were not a basis for reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant, Decatur County Rural Electric Membership Corporation (REMC), challenged a judgment of the Decatur Circuit Court (Indiana), which, pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 8-1-13-19 (1971) (Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-4418a), condemned certain electric utility properties owned by the REMC in favor of appellee utility company so that the utility could service an annexed area and appointed appraisers to determine a fair value.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The REMC claimed that &sect; 55-4418a was unconstitutional, that the utility's power to condemn and serve the annexed area had lapsed for nonuser, that the Indiana Public Service Commission (PSC) had exclusive jurisdiction and its approval was required for condemnation actions, and that the property was not properly described in the complaint. On review, the court found that &sect; 55-4418a allowed condemnation proceedings against REMCs; that the REMC held a certificate of convenience and necessity that was granted over 25 years before and was subject to termination under &sect; 55-4418a; that &sect; 55-4418a did not violate the Equal Protection Clause or the Supremacy Clause because it applied to all utility companies including REMCs; and that the United States as mortgagee of the REMC was not an indispensable party because the REMC's operating authority emanated from the State. The court ruled that the condemnation authority did not lapse for nonuser because &sect; 55-4418a did not specifically provide for a time limit, that there was nothing for the PSC to determine prior to the start of the action, and that the description allowed skilled persons to locate the property that was condemned.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, organizers of a music festival, challenged a decision of the Warrick Circuit Court (Indiana), which granted a restraining order against the occurrence of the festival upon the application of appellees, the Indiana State Board of Health and others. The organizers claimed that there was no evidence to support the order, that no notice was given, that no irreparable harm was shown, and that their civil rights were violated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Board sought the restraining order to prevent the festival from happening because large open-air festivals were injurious to the health and safety of the citizens. The complaint for the order included supporting affidavits and a certificate of efforts to give notice to the organizers. Photographs from other festivals showing unsanitary and illicit activities were submitted at the hearing. On review, the court found that admission of evidence of similar acts was within the discretion of the circuit court, that an ex parte hearing was allowed pursuant to Ind. R. Trial P. 65(B), that oral notice was given, and that Ind. R. Trial P. 65(C) did not require governmental entities to give security before the issuance of a restraining order. The court ruled that the evidence most favorable to the Board showed that there could be irreparable injury caused by disease and traffic, that an order would not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion, that the order was a valid exercise of the State's police power, and that the First Amendment right of assembly and the Commerce Clause were not offended by the restraining order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the trial court erred when it gave conflicting instructions on voluntary intoxication. Defendant was charged with several crimes, and the jury was instructed that he could be found guilty of any of them. Defendant's requested instruction applied to those crimes that required specific intent, and stated that voluntary intoxication was a defense. The State's instruction applied to those charges that did not require specific intent, and stated that voluntary intoxication was no defense. The court held that the trial court erred when it failed to inform the jury as to the particular circumstances under which they were to apply the two separate instructions. The court rejected defendant's argument that evidence of his conspiracy or attempt to rob the same gas station two nights later, which was thwarted when the attendant recognized him, was irrelevant and highly prejudicial. Such evidence showed that defendant had the necessary intent to commit the crimes with which he was charged. The court also held that the statute under which defendant was convicted was not unconstitutionally vague because an ordinary person could perceive the conduct that was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

At the close of the State's evidence, the trial court granted a judgment in favor of defendant after finding he was not guilty of escape. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court found that the conduct of defendant in failing to report as the rules of the work release center specified was a violation of the rules of the release center and that such violations were covered under Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court issued an injunction that prohibited the concert promoters from holding a rock festival in the county. When the concert was held nearby, requiring access through the county, the trial court held the concert promoters in criminal and civil contempt. The court first rejected the concert promoters claim that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because they had filed a motion for a change of judge because the trial court retained jurisdiction for emergency matters. The court then considered the first contempt conviction and found that the trial court erred when it denied a requested continuance and tried the concert promoters in absentia. The only criminal contempt was found when defendant's refused to pay the fine assessed for the first hearing. The court found the first contempt proceeding violated the concert promoters' due process rights in that their attorney was given no opportunity to prepare a defense or adequately represent his clients. The court found no evidence to support the fine assessed and ruled the fine was improper and void and contrary to law. Since the fine was improper, the criminal contempt conviction for failure to pay it was also reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owner's filed a petition to the Board for review of a county's board's assessment. The Board fixed the assessment at the same value that the county board assessed. The owners' appealed to the trial court. The Board asserted that the owners' prayer for relief was in excess of the trial court's power because the trial court could only, upon a determination adverse to the Board, remand the case to the Board for further proceedings. The trial court fixed the assessed value at $ 10,335. On appeal, the Board alleged that the trial court admitted evidence at trial which was not admitted before the Board. The court held that the action of the Board was arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful. The court found that the Board failed to preserve for review the issue of whether the trial court admitted evidence that was not before the Board. The court reversed the trial court's judgment because the trial court, in reducing the assessed value, exceeded its authority under Ind. Code &sect; 6-1-31-4 (1971), Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 64-1004 (Repl. 1961), which specifically required that where an assessment was deemed null and void, the matter was to be remanded to the Board for a new assessment.</SPAN></P>

The prosecuting attorney further contended that whether or prosecutor followed his case into another county, or whether he preserved his right to prosecute a case by appealing an adverse ruling on a motion to quash pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-1-47-2 (1971), the prosecuting attorney was engaged in his common law and statutory duty of conducting a prosecution. The court agreed with the Attorney General's contention that the Attorney General had exclusive appellate responsibilities in criminal cases.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The officer arrested the citizen for taunting a police officer and being a disorderly person in violation of two city ordinances. The citizen was taken into custody and detained at a jail until she was released on bail. She filed an action for false imprisonment against the officer and city. The trial court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim. The court held that the trial court properly dismissed the complaint because, even if it assumes that the ordinances under which she was arrested were unconstitutional, the officer Holder acted at least under color of lawful authority. Therefore, he and the city were protected from liability for false imprisonment. The officer could make a valid arrest for violation of ordinances subsequently determined to be unconstitutional. The court could not determine the constitutionality of the ordinances because the record failed to disclose that the question was properly raised. The citizen's complaint did not specify the provisions of the Indiana or United States Constitutions allegedly violated by the ordinances. Resolution of her constitutional claim could have no effect upon her right to recover from the officer and city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The fire chief of the city of Gary submitted a letter to the Board of Public Works and Safety, alleging certain instances of misconduct on the part of the employee. The employee first contended that his dismissal was in violation of Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 48-6105, 48-6249h (1972) because the Board did not afford a full evidentiary hearing. The court found that the two statutes conflicted on whether an employee could be suspended prior to a hearing. The court held that the more generally applicable statute, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-6105, yielded to Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-624h. The court held that the procedural requirements of Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-624h were not violated. The court was not persuaded by the employee's argument that the proceedings before the Commission were void by reason of the delay in filing a transcript. The delay was not significant and the prejudice thereby was not indicated. The employee asserted that he was entitled to a full evidentiary hearing prior to the implementation of any disciplinary action. However, it was consistently recognized that the interest of a government employee in retaining his job could be summarily denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of a denial of post-conviction relief arising out of a robbery conviction by the Marion Criminal Court, Division One (Indiana). Defendant was sentenced to an indeterminate period of not less than 10 years nor more than 25. At the time he filed his petition for post conviction relief, and at the time it was heard, his direct appeal was pending in the Indiana Supreme Court. The Supreme Court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant contended that because the crime was committed, the trial had, and the sentence imposed all while the 1969 version of the armed robbery statute was in effect, his minimum sentence for the lesser included offense of robbery should be no longer than the minimum sentence for armed robbery (the greater offense in which it was included). The court stated that the 5 to 30 year feature of the 1969 armed felony sentence applied to a conviction of robbery while armed. The court was required to order the sentence corrected, even though the error in sentence was neither raised nor noted in the direct appeal to the Supreme Court. Defendant's Miranda rights were not violated when he was not given an opportunity to sign &quot;Miranda rights&quot; waiver forms halfway through an eight-hour interrogation. Although the contention could have been meritorious in a different situation, it was frivolous in defendant's case. Defendant's identification arguments regarding a show-up procedure presented questions of the weight of the evidence, which were for the trial court only. The court remanded for a correction of defendant's sentence and otherwise affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The case was remanded to the trial court for a correction of defendant's sentence to an indeterminate term of not less than 5 nor more than 25 years. When the judgment was corrected, it would be affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Later, the officer saw a man in the back of a taxi cab fitting the robber's description. The officer stopped the cab and frisked the man, finding the same amount of cash taken from the store on the man. He also found a pistol under the front seat in the cab. The owner identified defendant as the man who had robbed the store and the gun as the one used in the robbery. Defendant was convicted of robbery and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The identification of a single eye witness, the store's owner, was sufficient to support defendant's conviction. Further, the money and gun taken from defendant after the cab was stopped were properly admitted into evidence because the similarity of the appearance of defendant to the description of the robber, his nervous behavior, the circuitous route of the cab, and the time and spatial relation of the &quot;stop&quot; to the crime would have warranted a man of common caution in stopping the cab and making further investigation. Moreover, the knowledge of the officer that the robber was armed with a pistol justified a limited search of the passenger area of the cab for weapons.</SPAN></P>

The inmate pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced to an indeterminate term of two to 20 years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Originally, the inmate was sentenced to two to 21 years. This was determined to be unconstitutional and the sentence was amended to two to 20 years. The inmate argued that his corrected indeterminate sentence of two to 20 years violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 16 in that its maximum term could exceed a determinate sentence of 10 to 20 years for commission of a felony while armed. In addition, the inmate argued that the trial court had jurisdiction to sentence pursuant to statute only, and that if a sentence was found unconstitutional, no sentence at all could be imposed. The court determined that the inmate's argument was based on the possibility that a person serving an indeterminate two to 20 year sentence for rape could serve more time that a person serving a determinate 10 to 20 year sentence for rape while armed. This result was based on speculation as to the behavior of the inmate during confinement. The court held that speculative assumption of variances in good time release from imprisonment for determinate and indeterminate sentences did not violate &sect; 16. In addition, the trial court did not lack jurisdiction to modify the inmate's original sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the sentence was unconstitutional and that the guilty plea had not been freely and voluntarily made. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court found that the trial court had not erred in refusing to discharge defendant because the penalty imposed on defendant was properly established by the legislature. The court held that the trial court had the duty to insure that defendant's guilty plea had been freely and voluntarily entered, and the court determined that the trial court had satisfied this obligation.

Plaintiff adjoining landowner had brought an action against he the lessee, the lessor, and defendants, a mayor and the members of the city council, to have the lease declared void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city, pursuant to a special ordinance, entered into a lease agreement with the lessee, whereby the lessee could use river front property for a marina operation, and the city would close certain streets on certain specified days and also on other days. The adjoining landowner sought to have Mt. Vernon, Ind., Ordinance No. 1301 and the lease executed pursuant thereto to be declared illegal, unlawful, and void. The court affirmed the trial court's holding that the lease was void on statutory grounds. The city did not have the statutory power to enter into the lease created by the ordinance. The powers of the city were created and limited by statute, with the prevailing law being the Indiana Powers of Cities Act, Ind. Ann. Stat. &sect; 48-1451, et seq. (1963). The lease in question was prohibited by a statute, which fell within the pre-emption rule of Ind. Code &sect; 18-5-29-1 (Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-6938 (Supp. 1963)). Because the legislature intended to completely occupy the field of the subject matter and to preclude any action by the city relating to that subject matter, the unused property could not be leased under &sect; 48-6938 unless it was for the reason specified in the statute.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, defendant claimed that the trial court was deprived of subject matter jurisdiction. On review, the court rejected that contention, finding that to the extent Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 49-2503 prohibited the bringing of criminal charges by affidavit in a circuit court, it was repealed by implication with the subsequent enactment of Ind. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 9-908, 9-909, which clearly authorized the bringing of criminal charges, with the exception of murder and treason, by affidavit in a circuit court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The remonstrators contested the annexation of their property by the city. They contended that the annexation provisions of Ind. Code &sect; 18-5-10-25 (1971, Ind. Ann. Stat. &sect; 48-722 (1972)) violated Ind. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1 by giving the courts the power to order an annexation, which was a legislative and not judicial power. The court disagreed. Although the statute stated that the courts &quot;may&quot; order a proposed annexation to take place, the grant of power was not discretionary but, rather, was mandatory such that there was not a separation of powers violation. Even though &quot;may&quot; ordinarily meant discretion when used in a statute, it was to be construed to mean &quot;shall&quot; when the ordinary meaning would defeat the object of the provision. The court found that the statute did not attempt to vest legislative power in the judiciary. Its purpose was to authorize the trial court to determine and adjudge whether or not the common council of a city, which was attempting to annex additional territory, had met certain statutory requirements after a remonstrance has been filed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The neighbors sought a permanent injunction to enjoin the corporation from constructing low cost housing in their neighborhood. A temporary injunction was granted but was subsequently dissolved and the permanent injunction was denied. The neighbors appealed. The first issue before the court was whether the trial court erred in granting the corporation a motion in limine over expert testimony. The court reversed the trial court's denial of the permanent injunction on this issue because motions in limine were limited to jury trials and this case was tried by the trial court and not a jury. The second issue presented was whether or not the Housing Authority Acts were an unconstitutional delegation of power to an administrative agency. The court held that the standards found in Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 18-7-11-3 (g)-(q); 18-7-11-4; 18-7-11-8 et seq. (1971); Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-8103 (g)-(q) (1972 Supp.); Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-8104 (1963). Ind. Stat.

The court found that because the issue before it was not presented by way of a habeas corpus petition by a parolee, the court did not consider the possible effect of the determinate-indeterminate dichotomy if placed within a different sequential and procedural framework. The measure in determining whether the penalty for one crime was greater than another was the maximum duration of the penalty, not the possible duration of imprisonment. Thus, the court rejected petitioners' appeal with respect to determinate-indeterminate sentences because the criminal court reduced their sentences. After the sentence reductions, the maximum duration of the penalty for the crime for which they were convicted was less than the maximum sentence for armed robbery.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was again granted a continuance and the case was reset for a trial. The trial court denied defendant's subsequent request for a continuance. Defendant was convicted of robbery and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court had not erred in denying defense counsel's final request for continuance because it was within the trial court's discretion and it had already granted defendant three continuances.

Appellant was adjudged liable to appellees on claims concerning a settlement and compromise. After filing an appeal bond, appellant failed to timely file a transcript and assignment of errors, and his appeal was dismissed. Appellees then filed a complaint on the appeal bond. In affirming the entry of summary judgment in favor of appellees, the court reasoned that the validity and obligation of the appeal bond turned on whether the underlying judgment was void. Appellant could not collaterally attack a judgment that was at most voidable. There was no question that the circuit court that entered judgment against appellant had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties. Therefore, the judgment was at most voidable and not void on its face.

The school district succeeded in having the venue of the case changed. The property owners alleged numerous errors by the trial court, which were all rejected on appeal. Affirming the denial of the motion to correct errors, the court found no error in the issuance of the writ of assistance because the school district paid the compensation and was entitled to possession of the condemned land.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was discovered unconscious in a car that was sitting near a street intersection with its lights on and its engine running. Defendant was convicted of driving while under the influence of liquor under Ind. Code &sect; 9-4-1-54 (1971). The court reversed. The court refused to accept defendant's assertion that Ind. Code &sect; 9-2-1-5(f) (1971), which specifically provided that the suspension of his driver's license remained in effect while his appeal was pending, was unconstitutional. The court found, inter alia, that the statute did not deny defendant a property right but merely suspended a privilege that the state could either grant or withhold in the reasonable exercise of its police power. The court noted that Ind. Code &sect; 9-4-1-54 (1971) used the word &quot;driving&quot; rather than &quot;operating&quot; and concluded that &quot;driving&quot; meant that the vehicle had to be in motion. In this case, and reversing defendant's conviction, the court found that there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was &quot;driving&quot; his car at the time and place charged.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a decision of the Starke Circuit Court (Indiana), which affirmed a final determination on a reassessment made by defendant State Board of Tax Commissioners of Indiana. The taxpayer had brought suit against the Board, as well as defendant county auditor and defendant attorney general, claiming that the state tax on certain business personal property violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On the assessment date, the taxpayer had in inventory certain goods which were manufactured for out-of-state purchasers. The goods had not been shipped, had not been placed in the original package for the purpose of shipment to an out-of-state destination, and were not designated for out-of-state shipment. The goods were taxed as business personal property. The taxpayer unsuccessfully brought suit. The court affirmed on appeal, finding no error. The court held that the state tax did not violate the Commerce Clause because the goods were not involved in interstate commerce. They were in no way launched on their way to another state nor committed to a common carrier. They were not put into the stream of commerce. Thus, they were taxable in Indiana. On another point, the court found Ind. Code &sect; 6-1-29-7 (1971) to be constitutional. It properly conferred on the State Board of Tax Commissioners the right to review the assessment or reassessment of any property, and to reassess any such property.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the board did not rebut the presumption of jurisdiction and the consideration of evidence in the absence of or without notice to the taxpayers so that it could be rebutted was a denial of due process of law. The court held that a final equalization order which affected a petitioner's tax assessment could be appealed through Ind. Code &sect; 6-1-31-4 (1971). The board did not show that the taxpayers failed to comply with the required procedures under &sect; 6-1-31-4. The court held that Ind. Code &sect; 6-1-38-6 (1971) did not justify the board's consideration of ex parte evidence, and thus it was a denial of due process to consider such evidence without notice and an opportunity to rebut the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed summary judgment for the taxpayers in their action to review the board's real property tax reassessments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioner and his counsel's testimony at the felony trial was the only evidence presented at the hearing below concerning representation of counsel. He therefore, failed to establish his grounds for relief by a preponderance of the evidence. He also submitted that he was denied due process because the prosecutor used perjured testimony and that he suppressed evidence with respect to the criminal record of a witness. The court was again confronted with the absence of evidence of record. Therefore, the court was unable to say that he was convicted by perjured testimony. However, the court agreed with him that his sentence imposed was not unconstitutional per se, but had to be modified. Notwithstanding the fact that the offense for which he was convicted was not an offense included in second degree burglary, and could have been more serious and dangerous than second degree burglary, his sentence could not be greater than that for second degree burglary. A penalty of one to 10 years' imprisonment for &quot;entering&quot; was unconstitutional only in the sense that it unfairly exceeded the maximum penalty for the more serious and &quot;greater&quot; crime of second degree burglary.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the judgment and remanded the cause to the trial court with instructions to enter a corrected judgment and commitment order nunc pro tunc for imprisonment for not less than one nor more than five years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The inmate entered his plea of guilty to a reduced charge of House Breaking in the Daytime to Commit a Felony. An attorney who also represented the inmate's son, the inmate's co-defendant, represented the inmate. The inmate waived his right to a presentence investigation and requested the trial court to pass immediate sentence. The trial court ordered the inmate imprisoned. The inmate filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which the trial court denied. Affirming the denial in part, the court held that the inmate's appointed attorney was competent and adequate and represented the inmate capably. The court noted that the attorney got both clients reduced sentences through plea-bargaining and did exactly as directed by his clients. The court held that the attorney did not have conflicting interests. The court found that the inmate's decision to plead to a longer sentence so his son could get a shorter one was his choice to make, and he could not be heard to complain. However, the court held that the trial court was required by Ind. Code &sect; 35-8-1-2; Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-2252 (1972) to review and consider a pre-sentence investigation prior to defendant's sentencing and commitment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court affirmed the denial of the inmate's petition for post-conviction relief but reversed in part and ordered the commitment order of the inmate amended to include a pre-commitment investigation and any other necessary proceedings not inconsistent with the court's decision.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioners filed a motion to dismiss the appeal or affirm the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Residents of the area adjacent to the city filed a petition with the Commissioners to incorporate the area as a town. Appellants appeared at the hearing on the petition and filed a written remonstrance. The Commissioners passed an ordinance incorporating the area. Appellants sought judicial review in the trial court. The Commissioners filed a motion to dismiss the review, which was granted. On appeal, the court held that Ind. Code &sect; 18-3-1-11 only gave a right to appeal the Commissioners' decision to a &quot;party&quot; to the proceedings before the Commissioners, and appellants were not parties before the Commissioners. The court further held that the Commissioners had a statutory right to raise the issue of standing before the trial court. Further, appellants' action in the trial court was a suit for declaratory judgment seeking to avoid the Commissioners' ordinance. Thus, it embraced the Public Lawsuit statutes, and, pursuant to Ind. R. App. P., appellants were required to have filed their brief within 10 days after filing the record. Since the brief was not filed within said time and no motion for extension of time was filed, the court was required to dismiss the appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of possession of heroin, and on appeal, the conviction was affirmed. Defendant argued that the search and seizure was illegal, that the chain of custody for the heroin was insufficient, and that the evidence did not establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that there was no evidence that defendant owned or had the right to possess the convertible; therefore, he could not vicariously draw on the owner's constitutional privilege against unreasonable search and seizure. The evidence established a reasonable chain of custody for the package and assurances were given that the package arrived in court in an undisturbed condition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The citizen sought an injunction on the theory that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-2701 (1956) applied to the operation of a retail bookstore selling allegedly obscene printed materials. The citizen also alleged that the operation constituted a public nuisance that could be enjoined by a private citizen under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2-505 (1967). At trial, the citizen put in evidence several exhibits consisting of materials had and others had purchased at the bookstore. The owner contended that the materials were not constitutionally obscene because they had &quot;redeeming social value.&quot; The trial court made no finding as to whether the materials were obscene and denied the injunction. In affirming the decision, the court held that the exception that obscenity was not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press did not apply to the case because the citizen was seeking to enjoin the dissemination by the owner of any publication anywhere in the county. The requested injunction would be an impermissible prior restraint on the First Amendment rights of speech and publication, and the trial court's denial was proper.</SPAN></P>

The attorney filed suit to recover the reasonable value of his services, and the client counterclaimed to recover losses caused by the attorney's alleged negligence. The counterclaim was based on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur because the operative facts were allegedly unknown to the client and known to the attorney. On appeal from a judgment in favor of the attorney, the court held that the client failed to establish its claim that Ind. Code &sect; 33-6-1-1 et seq., Ind. Stat. Ann &sect; 4-5801 et seq. (1972), which created the trial court, was unconstitutional because the client failed to show that he was harmed by the statute. The court further held that the trial court properly disposed of the client's counterclaim because he failed to show that the facts regarding the alleged injury were within the special control of the attorney and that the client did not have free access to the information.</SPAN></P>

Before his escape, defendant was serving a one-year sentence at the Indiana State Farm for theft. While serving his term for escape at the Indiana State Prison, he filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus for the reason that his one year sentence for theft had been served before he took his leave from the Indiana State Farm and was charged with escape. The LaPorte Circuit Court granted his petition for writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the court reversed with instructions to transfer the case to the Putnam Circuit Court. Transfer of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the court where the inmate was convicted or sentenced was mandatory under Ind. R. Trial P. 1, &sect; 1(c). A trial court that had only jurisdiction of the inmate's person and had received for filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus had to transfer the case without delay. The court noted that the Putnam Circuit Court had to decide whether the inmate was justified in escaping from the Indiana State Farm.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that his sentence should be corrected to a term of not less than one nor more than five years. The court reversed and remanded with instructions to enter a corrected judgment of sentence. The penalty for entering to commit a felony was one to five years since it was a lesser includable offense of second degree burglary. Assessing a penalty of not less than one nor more than 10 years for the offense of entering to commit a felony was error. The 10-year maximum was greater than the maximum of five years for second degree burglary. The court held that assessing such a penalty violated the Eighth Amendment and Ind.
