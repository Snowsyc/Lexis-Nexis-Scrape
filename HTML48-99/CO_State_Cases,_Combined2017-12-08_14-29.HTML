<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate maintained that when he was sentenced he had a detainer from the State of Oregon lodged against him of which he had no knowledge.

Stat. &sect;&sect; 24-60-501 to -507 (1982), by failing to properly inform him of the pending charges after he had commenced his term of imprisonment on his Colorado detention. The trial court dismissed the inmate's petitions. On appeal, the court held that the use of a habeas corpus proceeding was an improper vehicle for the relief sought by the inmate. The court determined that in the absence of showing that the inmate had obtained disposition of the charges in Oregon, there was no basis for granting relief pursuant to a habeas corpus action.</SPAN></P>

The victim was partially deaf and slightly impaired mentally. The court affirmed defendant's conviction.

Stat. &sect; 18-3-401(4) (1978) was unconstitutionally vague in violation of due process of law, that the trial court erred in denying his challenge for cause to a prospective juror, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury verdict. The court held that the statutory definition of &quot;sexual contact&quot; in &sect; 18-3-401(4) was not unconstitutionally vague and that the statutory proscription was not applied in an unconstitutional manner against defendant. The court further held that nothing in the transcript of the voir dire established an abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying defendant's challenge for cause of a prospective juror. The court also held that there was substantial and sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict. The court could not say that the prosecution's evidence was either incredible as a matter of law on the issue of &quot;sexual contact&quot; or so lacking in quantity or quality as to preclude a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the trial court, therefore, did not err in denying defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree assault and appealed on the grounds that prior to his testimony at trial, the lower court did not advise him that he had the right to remain silent or of the consequences of waiving that right, and that the lower court made no effort to determine whether defendant had voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to remain silent. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the absence of an advisement to defendant by the lower court of the right not to testify did not automatically render his waiver invalid or require, in and of itself, that a new trial be granted. The court held that there was less need for intervention by the lower court and an on-the-record advisement concerning the matter before defendant testified. The court found that the lower court was already required to advise defendant at his first appearance, that it was likely that defendant received other advisement during the course of the criminal investigation, and that it was unlikely that defense counsel would have allowed defendant to take the stand without a full explanation of the right to remain silent and the possible consequences of waiver.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction for murder in the first degree on the basis that one of the several alternative types of first degree murder submitted to the jury under a general verdict was that form of extreme indifference murder previously found to be constitutionally infirm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case decided after defendant was convicted, it was held that the statutory crime of &quot;knowingly&quot; committing extreme indifference murder, as defined in Colo.

Defendant then filed the motion in which he claimed that the submission of the constitutionally infirm offense violated due process of law. The court of appeals concluded that the submission to the jury of the extreme indifference murder charge was a constitutional error but that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the case for either a new trial or resentencing. The court found that the submission of the constitutionally infirm crime of extreme indifference murder under a general verdict was constitutional error, that the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and that either a new trial or resentencing on the lesser offense of second degree murder was an appropriate remedy for redressing the error.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that &sect; 18-1-105(9)(a)(III) did not violate defendant's procedural due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution because defendant was given reasonable notice that he was subject to enhanced sentencing at the arraignment and again at the sentencing hearing. The court ruled that &sect; 18-1-105(9)(a)(III) did not deny defendant equal protection of the laws where it was not discriminatory and where the statute was rationally related to the legitimate state interest in dealing with the problem of recidivism. The court also ruled that the trial court's misstatement of defendant's possible sentence at the arraignment was harmless error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to defendant's conviction for second degree assault, he pled guilty to conspiracy to commit burglary. The trial court therein explained the elements of the conspiracy portion of the charge but did not explain the elements of the underlying burglary charge. Ten years later defendant was placed under arrest for driving under the influence, and in the process of being arrested defendant assaulted two police officers. The trial court convicted defendant of second degree assault and of being a habitual criminal, the appellate court affirmed, and the court affirmed the decision of the appellate court. The court held that even though defendant assaulted the police officers during a field arrest he could be convicted under &sect; 18-3-203(1)(f) because that section was not limited to assaults upon detention officers. The court ruled that even though defendant did not receive an explanation of the charge of burglary when he was previously convicted for conspiracy to commit burglary, his guilty plea was voluntary because he had been convicted of burglary before and the elements of burglary were known to him and were not complex.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of judgments from the District Court of Jefferson County (Colorado), which convicted him of several counts of unlawful possession of altered motorcycle parts, in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-5-102(2) (1981).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following jury trials in three cases, defendant was convicted of several counts of unlawful possession of altered motorcycle parts in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-5-102(2) (1981). Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held &sect; 42-5-102(2) did not violate defendant's equal protection rights by allegedly imposing a higher penalty for conduct that was proscribed under Colo. Rev. Stat. 18-5-305 (1978) where the two statutes punished different, albeit related, criminal conduct. The court noted that possession was not an element of &sect; 18-5-305 unlike &sect; 42-5-102(2) and that &sect; 42-5-102(2) only required proof of knowing requirement as &sect; 18-5-305 required proof of intent to hinder. The court determined defendant was not entitled to Miranda warnings prior to filing out a form to obtain a certificate of title where he was neither in custody nor the subject of interrogation. The court concluded evidence that was obtained as the result of a court ordered inventory arising from a civil nuisance complaint against defendant was properly admitted because the evidence was in plain view, the officers were acting within their authority, and they were legitimately on the premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that a statute that prohibited the alteration of vehicle identification numbers or the possession thereof was not unconstitutional on the ground that it provided a stricter penalty than another statute allegedly proscribing the same conduct where the statutes contained different elements and punished different criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Defendant motor vehicle division conducted a hearing and revoked the driver's license. The driver sought review and the District Court, Jefferson County (Colorado) affirmed the revocation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected the driver's claim that he was not driving within Colo. Rev.

The court also rejected the claim that the breathalyzer test results lacked an adequate foundation because the evidence showed that the machine was in proper working order at the time of the test and that the officer was qualified to conduct the test. The court also held that there was no constitutional or statutory requirement to inform a driver that he had the right to refuse such tests, that he had a choice between tests, or of the legal consequences of refusing to take any tests. Thus, the court rejected the driver's claims based on the failure to be advised of these matters. The court also rejected the driver's claim that his right to have a breath sample preserved for independent testing was abridged by the hearing officer's refusal to consider evidence from such testing. Because the driver did not seek a breath sample, the court found that the driver was unable to offer proof based on any such testing; therefore, there was no basis for these claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a chiropractor, sexually assaulted a patient when he conducted a vaginal examination. The patient claimed that defendant stimulated her clitoris under the guise of performing a cursory examination for a vaginal infection and inserted his fingers into her vagina. Defendant testified that the patient's legs were six inches apart at the knees during his visual examination. On rebuttal, the state introduced the testimony of a registered nurse who claimed that it was impossible to make the necessary observations to determine whether a vaginal infection was present when the patient's legs were only six inches apart. The district court convicted defendant of second-degree sexual assault in violation of &sect; 18-3-403(1)(h). Defendant argued that &sect; 18-3-403(1)(h) was unconstitutionally vague and that his request to present surrebuttal evidence was improperly denied. The court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. Although the court upheld the constitutionality of &sect; 18-3-403(1)(h), it held that defendant was entitled to present surrebuttal evidence because he was unable to present or oppose, during his case-in-chief, the new matter introduced by the registered nurse.</SPAN></P>

Following the people's case-in-chief, defendant made a motion for a judgment of acquittal, during which the trial court raised the issue of the validity of two of defendant's previous convictions, concluding that they were unconstitutional because the pleas were not made knowingly and voluntarily. The people moved for a continuance on the ground that no notice was given and time was needed to prepare to contest the issue. The trial court denied that motion and the people's subsequent motions for recusal, based on the trial court's partiality, and for a mistrial. On appeal, the court disapproved the trial court's rulings, finding that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied the people's motion for a continuance to gather evidence to show that the prior guilty pleas were constitutional. Although the court found that the pleas were taken in compliance with Colo. R. Crim.

The department issued a notice of violation for the Outdoor Advertising Act (Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43-1-412(2)(a) (1984) to the owner of the billboard site. Subsequently, the advertising agency applied for a sign permit which was denied. The advertising company also filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief against the department. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the advertising company, ruling that the Act constituted an ex post facto legislation in violation of the Colo. Const. art.

On appeal, the department argued that the billboard was illegal under the prior Act and regulations, and therefore, the reenactment of the Act was not retrospective because the advertising company could not have relied upon the provisions of the prior law.

Moreover, the nurse maintained that the failure of the nursing board to promulgate standards of nursing conduct and guidelines of discipline deprived her of due process.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, two individuals, were charged with violating the commercial bribery statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-5-401 (1978). The trial court granted appellees' motions to dismiss the charges on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional on its face and unconstitutionally overbroad. The trial court's principal basis for holding the statute unconstitutional on its face was that the language of &quot;duty of fidelity&quot; was not defined, and the statute therefore improperly provided that private persons, those to whom the duty was owed, defined the duty. The trial court's judgment was reversed on appeal and the trial court was ordered to reinstate the information. The court stated that the trial court should not have addressed the merits of appellees' unconstitutional claims because appellees did not have standing to raise the question, and that the law set sufficient parameters as to the meaning of the term, &quot;duty of fidelity,&quot; so as not to allow the person to whom the duty was owed an unfettered discretion in defining the term. Moreover, the statute did not establish an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to private persons.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff applicant appealed from an order of the District Court, Twentieth Judicial District (Colorado), which denied her request for a declaratory judgment against defendants, attorney general and county clerk, and ruled that the statute restricting the opportunity to serve as an election judge to persons affiliated with one of two major political parties was valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant, a member of the Socialist Party, requested an appointment as an election judge. The county clerk denied the applicant's request on the ground that the applicant was required to have been a member of a major political party. The applicant filed a declaratory judgment action. The trial court ruled that the statute restricting the opportunity to serve as an election judge to persons who have affiliated with one of two major political parties did not violate the applicant's freedom of speech and association or her right to equal protection of the laws. The applicant appealed, claiming that the restriction on eligibility to serve as an election judge to those affiliated with a major political party significantly impaired her fundamental right of association with the Socialist Party and therefore should have been subjected to strict scrutiny. The court concluded that the statutory restrictions on the appointment of election judges did not interfere with the applicant's ability to have expressed her political views. The court held that the rational basis test applied to the claim and that the restrictions on election judges were rationally related to a legitimate purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, county hospital board of trustees and a doctor, sought review of a judgment that was entered by the District Court of Moffat County (Colorado), which reversed the trustees' decision not to suspend the doctor's medical privileges at the hospital. That decision was reversed after appellee county hospital executive committee filed an action in the district court that challenged the denial of the suspension.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The executive committee suspended the doctor's medical privileges at the hospital. Upon review, the trustees reversed the suspension order. The executive committee contended that its right to review the trustees' reversal derived from the professional review statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 12-43.5-101 to -103 (1985). The trustees contended that the executive committee lacked standing to challenge its decision. The court vacated the district court's reversal of the trustees' decision. The court held that (1) the executive committee lacked standing to challenge the trustees' decision, and (2) the district court erred in considering the executive committee's claims that were raised in its complaint. The court found that (1) the executive committee was a subordinate arm of the board of trustees, and (2) it was not an aggrieved person. By analogy, the court applied the reasoning found in the rule that in the absence of an express statutory right, a subordinate state agency lacked standing or any other legal authority to obtain judicial review of an action of a superior state agency. The executive committee was subordinate to the trustees by virtue of the county hospital's bylaws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the executive committee's action to review the trustees' denial of the doctor's suspension, the district court's order, which reversed the trustees' decision and reinstated the suspension, was vacated. The case was remanded to the district court with directions to vacate its judgment and dismiss the executive committee's complaint.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also challenged the enhanced sentences imposed for the convictions on the basis that they violated equal protection, due process and double jeopardy. The court affirmed defendant's convictions finding that, when viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence was substantial and sufficient to support the conclusion by a reasonable mind that defendant was guilty of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The court further held that, although portions of the second degree kidnapping statute was unconstitutionally vague, it did not result in automatic invalidation of the entire statute. Finally, the court held that the verdicts did not require reversal for inconsistency because the crimes charged required different elements of proof.</SPAN></P>

The court referred the matter to a magistrate, and adopted the magistrate's findings of fact and conclusions of law. The magistrate found that the organizations provided legal services to the employers and that such action constituted the unauthorized practice of law. Secondly, he found that the Colorado Supreme Court, not the legislature, had the exclusive authority to regulate the practice of law. However, he also found that the statute conformed to the judiciary's authority to regulate the practice of law and that the statute was, therefore, gratuitous. Hence, it was not necessary to hold that it was unconstitutional. The magistrate found that permitting the organizations to continue in their practice before the division was in the public interest.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city leased defendant company a portion of a public park that encompassed the Royal Gorge, subject to it building a suspension bridge over the gorge. At the end of the term, the bridge could be purchased or the lease could be extended for 20 years, at which time defendant city would own the bridge without further payment. For the next few years, several amendments were entered into, none of which were submitted to the voters for approval. When extensive modernization of the bridge became necessary, defendants negotiated another amendment regarding cost. Plaintiff residents asked for referral of the issue to voters, but when defendant city council determined that the amendment was administrative rather than legislative and was not subject to the referendum power, plaintiffs filed a suit. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendants, and plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed, holding that elected city officials were required to make administrative decisions on a day-to-day basis, and to subject each decision to referendum would result in chaos.

The long-distance provider argued that it was not a public utility subject to state taxation, that it owned no property in Colorado, and that the state tax violated the Commerce Clause of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3. The court disagreed, holding that: (1) the long-distance provider was a telephone company and, thus, was a public utility for state taxation purposes, as it allowed unrelated persons to communicate; (2) the lease of telephone circuits was properly considered in determining the value of that operating property and plant by the unitary assessment method applicable to public utilities; (3) that the assessment was proper under 16B Colo.

He was again convicted of driving while his ability was impaired in 1982. Pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-122(1)(g), as amended in 1981, the department revoked his license. The licensee argued that the statute applied only to offenses committed on or after July 1, 1981, the effective date of the statute. The court ruled that the revocation was proper because the legislature, in amending the statute, intended to permit a revocation to be predicated on offenses committed prior to July 1, 1981, so long as the new or &quot;triggering offense&quot; was committed on or after the statute's effective date. The licensee claimed that such construction resulted in the statute being unconstitutionally retroactive. The court disagreed because it was only the triggering offense to which the consequence attached and, so long as that offense occurred after the effective date of the statute, the legislation was not retroactive. Likewise, such construction did not violate due process because the statute gave adequate notice of the proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>

Appellee cardiologist was later added as a defendant. The trial court granted summary judgment to the cardiologist based on limitations under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-105 (1985 Supp.).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient suffered brain damage after a cardiac irregularity was noted but not diagnosed during unrelated surgery. He learned of the cardiologist's possible involvement in the incident during the deposition of one of the doctors. The patient and next friends contended on appeal that he was a &quot;person under disability&quot; so as to toll the running of limitations and repose. The court noted that if the malpractice statute were to be construed to impose an absolute and unconditional three-year period of repose on a claim brought by or on behalf of a mental incompetent, the legislative decision to include a &quot;mental incompetent&quot; within the statutory definition of a &quot;person under disability&quot; in &sect; 13-80-105(3) would be a legislative anomaly without any effect. The court thus held that the tolling provisions of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-81-103(1)(a) (1973) applied to both the limitation and repose periods applicable to medical malpractice claims.

The Colorado Motor Vehicle Dealer Licensing Board (Board) suspended the dealership's license for 10 days for violation of Colo. Rev.

The trial court affirmed the board's decision. The court affirmed, holding that Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff professor sought review of the judgment of the Boulder County District Court (Colorado), which dismissed his claims against defendant university on the grounds that the professor did not comply with the notice provisions of the Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 24-10-102 - 24-10-118, the Eleventh Amendment proscribed his claims, and the complaint did not state a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the university was a &quot;public entity&quot; under the Governmental Immunity Act (the Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 24-10-102 - 24-10-118. However, the court determined that the professor failed to comply with the Act's notice requirements because his first complaint, which addressed the statutory requirements for a tort claim against a public entity, was never served upon the university. Therefore, the dismissal of his tort claims was proper. The court held that the Eleventh Amendment did not proscribe the professor's 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims because the Eleventh Amendment was jurisdictional and it prohibited citizens from bringing suit against states in federal courts. It did not apply to the professor's action, which was initiated in state court. The court also held that the university was a &quot;person&quot; under &sect; 1983 and that the professor's alleged constitutional deprivations were sufficient to state a claim for relief under &sect; 1983 to the extent they were founded on intentional, grossly negligent, or reckless conduct. Conduct of the university's employees pursuant to official university policy that caused a constitutional tort was actionable under &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>

His motion for a new trial was denied, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. His appeal was predicated on a claim that the trial court erred in its instruction which defined &quot;after deliberation&quot; as an element of the offense of first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's friend testified that defendant admitted to him that he shot the victim five times, struck his head with a rock, and drove the victim's own car over the victim's head, all in an effort to kill him. He then stole the car. He was charged with first-degree murder when the victim died of head trauma. Defendant's objections to jury instructions on premeditation were denied, and he was convicted, he appealed. An appeals court affirmed, and defendant again appealed. The court affirmed. It found that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that the only time requirement for deliberation within the meaning of the statute was &quot;an interval sufficient for one thought to follow another&quot; because that language had been rejected by the court. Further, a premeditated act, for the purpose of the charged offense, was not one that was committed in a hasty or impulsive manner, but required that an appreciable length of time had elapsed between the decision and the act. Moreover, even though the error was of &quot;constitutional dimensions,&quot; the court held that the evidence of deliberation was so overwhelming that it required a finding that no reversible error was committed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that 1) Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-401 (1978) did not deprive defendant of his rights to equal protection and due process of law because it was a sound legislative decision to allow a penal statute to punish offenses that contained alternative culpable mental state elements similarly, and because the legislature could limit affirmative defenses to particular crimes; 2) the proper mens rea was applied to the theft counts because proof of knowing conduct satisfied the culpable mental state requirements; 3) the trial court did not reject evidence that defendant could not appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct, but rather accepted expert witness testimony and carefully analyzed it; and 4) the verdict was supported by substantial and sufficient evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and stipulated to a sentence of 15 to 25 years in prison. More than two and one-half years after sentence was imposed, defendant filed pro se motions under Rule 35 for a reduction of his sentence. He asserted the delay in filing the motion should be excused because he was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to file a Rule 35 motion before the 120-day deadline. After a hearing, the trial court denied his motion, but made no factual findings regarding his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The appellate court affirmed, and defendant appealed. In reversing and remanding, the court held that (1) Colo. R. Crim. P. 45 allowed the trial court to extend filing deadlines for good cause; (2) if defendant was unconstitutionally deprived of the opportunity to file his Colo. R. Crim. P. 35 motion because of ineffective assistance of counsel, then the trial court would have jurisdiction to extend the time limit for filing the motion; (3) it was not possible from the record to determine the merits of defendant's claim of ineffective counsel and remand of the case was required.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals held that this refusal was harmless error because the military conviction was admissible as a prior felony conviction. The court reversed and remanded, holding that because it was unknown if the military conviction was obtained in accordance with constitutional standards, the trial court's failure to rule on its admissibility until defendant actually testified at trial impermissibly burdened defendant's constitutional right to testify in his own defense. The court also held that because there was no rational basis in the evidence for the jury to acquit defendant of the completed crime of second degree kidnapping and still convict him of the lesser included offense of attempted second degree kidnapping, the trial court properly refused to instruct on the lesser included offense of attempted second degree kidnapping.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the District Court, Rio Blanco County (Colorado), which convicted him of two counts of sexual assault on a child, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-3-405(1) (1978), and two counts of indecent exposure, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-7-302(1), (2) (1978).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was convicted based on evidence that he had exposed himself to and initiated sexual contact with an 11-year-old boy. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 18-7-302 violated the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions and that the trial court erred in denying defense objections to the introduction of evidence. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the language of &sect; 18-7-302(1) set forth a readily identifiable objective standard for measuring the proscribed conduct and that therefore it did not violate either U.S. Const. amend. XIV or Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. The court held that the information was properly amended to add the two indecent exposure charges and that evidence supporting those charges was properly admitted. The court affirmed the trial court's conclusion that defendant's use of magazines immediately prior to touching the child was probative to the issue of the purpose of the touching and was not unduly prejudicial under Colo. R. Evid. 403. Finally, the court held that the evidence that defendant grabbed the child's hand and told him to masturbate the defendant was sufficient to support the convictions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual challenged the order of the District Court of Mineral County (Colorado) that entered judgment in favor of appellee ski company in appellant's personal injury action which alleged that appellee was negligent in failing to warn of the dangerous condition of one of its ski slopes and in failing to eliminate the condition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant individual filed an action against appellee ski company after he suffered severe injuries while skiing down a slope at appellee's ski resort. Appellant testified that while skiing, he unexpectedly became airborne due to a variation in terrain, and that appellee was negligent in failing to warn of the slope's dangerous condition and negligent in failing to eliminate the condition. The jury returned a verdict for appellee, and judgment was entered accordingly. Appellant alleged that the Ski Safety Act of 1979, 14 Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-44-109(2) (1984), which stated that skiers were responsible for their collision with any person, natural object, or man-made structure, was unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that although &sect; 33-44-109(2) was not unconstitutional, it was improper for the district court to include in a negligence per se instruction the rebuttable presumption of negligence. The court noted that the instruction improperly suggested that the presumption of negligence present in &sect; 33-44-109(2) was conclusive, rather than rebuttable, and that the repetitive nature of some of the instructions made them confusing.</SPAN></P>

The District Court in and for the County of Douglas (Colorado) granted: 1) a new trial on damages, and; 2) judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the basis that the prosecutors were absolutely immune in certain transactions. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner claimed that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the prosecutors' participation in drafting affidavits in support of a Crim. P. 41.1 order for nontestimonial identification evidence, a search warrant, and an arrest warrant. Petitioner also claimed that his Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights were violated by one prosecutor's approval of a suggestive photo lineup consisting of only two color pictures of petitioner. The court held that the prosecutors were not absolutely immune for their involvement in the above transactions. In so ruling, the court noted that: 1) the affidavits were drafted, and photo lineup performed, prior to the filing of criminal charges; 2) unlike trial proceedings, there were no procedural safeguards, such as defense counsel or an impartial judicial officer, to restrain or mitigate prosecutorial abuse, and; 3) the transactions were within the realm of traditional police activity. The court also held that the jury's award was not so excessive as to warrant the grant of a new trial. Petitioner was deprived of basic constitutional rights, suffered emotional problems, income loss, and criminal defense fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 11-51-123 (1)-124 (Supp. 1985) for fraudulent and other prohibited practices in connection with the sale of securities. The defendant challenged his conviction on the grounds that Colorado Securities Act, Colo. Rev.

The court rejected the constitutional challenges to Colorado Securities Act, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 11-51-123 (1) (Supp. 1985). The court held that the trial court's instruction to the jury that good faith was not a defense to securities fraud resulted in nullifying the mens rea element of the crimes charged against defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court had ruled that a witness' testimony compelled by the grant of immunity from prosecution was not a sufficient act of free will on the part of the witness to dissipate the taint of illegality for purposes of the attenuation doctrine. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, and remanded the matter to the lower court with directions to return the case to the district court for further findings. The court concluded that the trial court had to resolve the attenuation issue by the application of appropriate standards to the evidence. The court rejected the per se rule adopted by the lower court and formulated appropriate standards to be used by the trial court in determining whether the disputed evidence had been purged of the taint of illegality by significant intervening events. The court found that certain statements obtained from a witness who had tape recorded defendant in exchange for a promise of immunity were fruit of the poisonous tree for purposes of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 18. The lower court had also concluded that the inevitable discovery issue had not been properly preserved for appellate review. The court affirmed that ruling.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in an attack on a prison guard at Colorado prison. He hit the guard in the head twice with a ball peen hammer as he and another inmate were trying to lock the guard in a cell. As the guard tried to escape, defendant again struck his head with the hammer and threatened to kill him. The guard managed to escape and received stitches in two areas on his head. Defendant was charged with attempted first-degree murder. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, but the trial judge granted defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal after concluding that, based on the lack of serious bodily injury to the guard, there was no evidence in support of the proposition that there was a real and proximate risk of death. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the trial court erred in looking to the extent of the victim's injuries, rather than by also considering the nature of the defendant's conduct. The court held that the fact that the guard escaped without life-threatening or serious injuries in no way altered the fact that repeated hammer blows to the head posed a real and proximate risk of death to the recipient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff widow sought review of a judgment of the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado), which affirmed the decision of defendants, board of trustees of the firemen's pension fund (board), city, and county, that denied her benefits as the surviving spouse of a disabled fireman. The denial was pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-30-509 (1977), as the widow was not married to the fireman when he applied for retirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fireman retired with a disability retirement pension and married the widow four years after his retirement; they remained married until the fireman's death. The widow applied for benefits from the firemen's pension fund. The application was denied because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-30-509 (1977), which governed the payment of benefits to widows of retired firemen in cities with populations greater than 100,000, only granted benefits to widows who married the firemen before the firemen applied for retirement. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court, which affirmed the decision of the board, city, and county to deny the widow benefits. The court remanded the cause to the trial court. The court found no rational basis for a benefit scheme that refused benefits only to widows of retired firemen in cities of over 100,000 who married firemen after they applied for retirement. The statutory scheme arbitrarily deprived those widows of equal protection of the laws, and, therefore, violated the guarantees of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. The statute was unconstitutional and, thus, could not have been applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant state governor appealed from the District Court, City and County of Denver (Colorado) judgment for plaintiff state legislature in its suit for declaratory judgment to determine the constitutional validity of the governor's vetoes of provisions in a general appropriation bill and a supplemental bill, and the constitutionality of the portions of the bills purportedly vetoed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor approved an appropriations long bill with some exceptions. He purported to veto certain portions of the bill designating the sources from which cash funding was to be obtained for certain projects, by lining through the sentence that identified the source of funds. The legislature sued for a declaration that such line-item vetoes were invalid because they did not encompass complete &quot;items&quot;; therefore they were not within the governor's power to disapprove. The governor's motion to dismiss was denied. The legislature's motion for partial summary judgment was granted. The court affirmed, finding that the challenged vetoes did not relate to entire items and so were not within the governor's constitutional veto power, specifically that funding sources for an appropriation were only parts of items and could not be vetoed independently. The governor's vetoes were void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment sustaining the legislative enactments and invalidating the vetoes was affirmed. The legislature had standing to challenge the validity of the governor's vetoes and the issue was justiciable. Exercise of legislative power to designate sources of appropriations did not intrude on the governor's powers. Funding source restrictions were not separate items and could not be line-item vetoed. The governor's attempt to do so was void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the purchasers contended that the FED did not permit an accelerated trial setting. The purchasers further argued that if the FED permitted an accelerated trial setting, the statute deprived them of due process of law by failing to allow sufficient time for trial preparation. Finally, the purchasers maintained that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant a continuance. The court rejected the purchasers' arguments and affirmed the rulings of the district court. Specifically, the court found that the structure of the FED evinced a legislative intent to accelerate trial settings in order to provide an expeditious remedy. Further, the court found that due process was satisfied because the FED statute permitted continuances in cases requiring extensive trial preparation. Finally, the court found that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the purchasers' motion for a continuance because the motion was interposed solely for delay.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-122(1)(g) (1984) then in effect. The driver claimed that &sect; 42-2-122(1)(g) could not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department held a hearing to determine whether the driver's license should be revoked. The hearing officer found that the driver had been convicted twice of the offense of driving while his ability was impaired by alcohol within the past five years and revoked his license. The driver claimed that because one of the offenses occurred before the passage of &sect; 42-2-122(1)(g) it could not be used to revoke his driving privileges. The court affirmed. Application of a statute was not rendered retroactive and unlawful merely because the facts upon which it operated occurred before adoption of the statute. The legislative intent was that only the triggering offense had to occur after the effective date of &sect; 42-2-122(1)(g). Because one of the offenses occurred after the effective date of &sect; 42-2-122(1)(g), it could be applied to the driver. The predicate offense merely operated as a condition, which triggered the consequence imposed by &sect; 42-1-122(1)(g).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district serviced an area including land owned by the owner's predecessor, a developer. Although all district property was taxed for years at a uniform rate, in 1982 the district taxed unplatted parcels owned by the developer at a rate of 530 mills, but taxed the rest of the property in the district at a rate of 15 mills. The district court upheld the district's authority to tax property at varying rates but ordered the levy set aside until the district sought the approval of the commissioners to modify its 1974 service plan for the parcels, as required by Colo.

On appeal, the court affirmed the decision upholding the district's authority to impose the tax but reversed the order setting aside the levy pending the commissioners' approval. The court held that the district was authorized under Colo. Rev.

While awaiting trial on the charges, defendant was released to the custody of the State of Michigan pursuant to a detainer request.

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the superintendent failed to promptly inform defendant of his rights under the Act. The trial court granted defendant's motion finding that defendant was not promptly informed of his rights under the Act. The People appealed. Defendant claimed that the superintendent's duty to promptly inform defendant of his rights under the Act was initiated when the superintendent became aware of pending charges against defendant. The court held that the superintendent's duty to inform defendant's of his rights pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-14-102(2) did not arise under a detainer had been filed. The trial court erred in granting defendant's motion because mere awareness of other charges pending against an inmate in another jurisdiction did not trigger the superintendent's duty to inform defendant of his rights under the Act.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court concluded that the elemental instruction on child abuse was not erroneous under the evidentiary record and that the evidence was sufficient to withstand the defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal. However, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial, concluding that the trial court committed reversible error in striking on its own motion the statutory affirmative defense of treatment through spiritual means.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with two counts of aggravated robbery and two counts of violent crime. At trial he presented an alibi defense through a witness who was a co-worker with defendant who verified defendant's presence at the place of employment on the night of the robberies. The People presented rebuttal evidence that impeached the credibility of the alibi witness by proving he had been fired the day after the robberies occurred and not a week and a half later as he testified. The district court refused to allow defendant surrebuttal evidence to rehabilitate the witness concerning his date of firing and the jury convicted defendant of the offenses charged. Defendant appealed and the court reversed and remanded the cause for a new trial, finding that the district court's denial of the surrebuttal evidence was not harmless error because the rebuttal evidence presented by the People cast doubt on whether defendant's premier alibi witness actually remembered the night in question. The district court abused its discretion in denying the surrebuttal testimony offered by defendant because that evidence was intended to meet a new matter presented by the People on rebuttal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Governor authorized the transfer of appropriated funds to other departments, and he did not submit for appropriation funds that were obtained through a settlement. The general assembly filed suit. The trial court held that the settlement funds were not subject to appropriation because they were, in essence, a gift, and the transfer of funds was authorized by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 24-30-201(1)(b), 24-37-405(1)(k) (1982), but that those statutes violated constitutional provisions vesting the general assembly with sole authority over appropriations. The court reversed in part and held that the statutes were not unconstitutional and did not delegate the power of the general assembly. The transfers between departments impermissibly infringed on the general assembly's plenary power of appropriation and did not fall within the governor's inherent authority. The court affirmed in part and held that the general assembly unlawfully invaded governor's executive authority and unconstitutionally restricted the governor from carrying out his powers. The settlement funds were not subject to appropriations because the money was required to be used for a purpose approved by non-Colorado authorities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed insofar as it concluded that the departmental transfers of funds were not authorized, that the governor properly exercised executive authority over the settlement fund, and that the governor failed to satisfy his burden of proof respecting the two counterclaims.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged a ruling of the District Court, Fremont County (Colorado), which disqualified the county district attorney and his staff because a deputy district attorney was endorsed as a witness, and refused to sentence defendant for violating the conditions of her bond in excess of the statutorily prescribed presumptive range. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-212 (1984 Supp.).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a conviction and while still on bond, defendant failed to appear. Defendant was charged with violating the conditions of her bond under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-212(1) (1984 Supp.). The trial court disqualified the county district attorney's office because a deputy district attorney was endorsed as a witness. The trial court also refused to sentence defendant in excess of the statutorily prescribed presumptive range. Both parties appealed. The court affirmed and reversed in part. The court found no abuse of discretion in the disqualification of the county district attorney's office because the witness' testimony was necessary to prove an essential element of the offense and the prosecuting staff was small. However, the failure to sentence defendant to a term greater than the presumptive range was held to be erroneous because the increase was required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-105(9)(a). The court held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-212 did not violate double jeopardy because it charged a separate and distinct offense from the initial charge. The imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence for violations of &sect; 18-8-212 was not irrational and did not violate due process.</SPAN></P>

The statute imposing a mandatory minimum sentence for bail violations was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

On petition for certiorari review, the court reversed the appellate court's order affirming the reduction in benefits, holding that although the commission expressly recognized that the auditor's constitutionally protected activities under U.S. Const. amend.

In case one, the district court denied appellant coin dealer's request for an injunction preventing the enforcement of the Act, and in case two, the state appealed the trial court's judgment dismissing criminal charges filed against defendant for violations of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The coin dealer and defendant argued, inter alia, that the Purchasers of Valuable Articles Act (the Act) was unconstitutional because it infringed upon the federal government's exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of currency and gold and silver bullion and because the United States Congress had preempted regulation of the subject matter. On appeal, the court disagreed and found that the Act survived each of the constitutional arguments against it. Particularly, the court held that the Act did not violate the principles relating to the coining or regulation of money because the provisions of the Act regulating the trade of valuable coins regulated the coins as articles and not currency. Further, the court found that the federal government had not preempted the field covered by the Act and that the Act did not impose any impermissible burden upon interstate commerce. Lastly, the court held that the records keeping and reporting provisions of the Act did not violate any constitutional search or incrimination protections under the applicable case law dealing with administrative searches and required records doctrines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nursing home claimed that the state was precluded from relying upon improperly published regulations to terminate the nursing home's Medicaid provider agreement. The court agreed that the regulations relied upon by the state were not published in accordance with the statutory requirements then in effect, but reversed the appellate court's order that the nursing home be given 90 days to comply with Medicaid standards. In so holding, the court found that 1) because the regulations were rendered statutorily incompetent based on the state's failure to properly publish them, the state was precluded from relying on them to terminate the nursing home's Medicaid provider agreement; 2) because the state provided the nursing home with a detailed list of the regulations it had violated, the nursing home's due process rights were not violated by the regulations and procedures that provided the basis for the revocation of its operating license; and 3) the appellate court acted in excess of its powers in ordering the state to recertify or relicense the nursing home at the expiration of the 90-day period, as the decision to recertify was statutorily committed to the state.</SPAN></P>

X, &sect;&sect; 3,7 and 8, and the Equal Protection Clause. The board contended that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 26-1-125 (1982) did not limit the county's funding duties, that it was owed reimbursement of foster care expenses, and that pass-through programs were not part of the county's 20 percent funding duties. The department claimed the state had no duty to fully fund the county contingency fund. The court affirmed the lower court's judgment. The funding system was constitutional. Counties retained enough control over funds and the tax system was uniform within each county. Moreover, the funding system properly served both county and state purposes, and was rationally related to a legitimate state interest. Counties had to appropriate funds from ad valorem taxes to pay their share of public assistance programs' costs, the mill levies of which were not limited to 20 percent. Foster care and pass-through program percentages were properly determined. Also, former legislators' testimony was inadmissible evidence of intent. Finally, the state had to fully fund county contingency funds as necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charges were based on a series of conversations about a plan to commit murder. Appellant allegedly engaged in the conversations at issue with a fellow inmate while appellant was incarcerated for a drug conviction. Appellant also allegedly attempted to induce another person to testify falsely at a hearing on appellant's drug conviction. Appellant raised numerous issues on appeal, including that the criminal solicitation statute, 8 Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18-2-301 (1978) was unconstitutional, that the trial court should have severed charges and suppressed evidence, that erroneous evidentiary rulings were made during the trial, that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of renunciation and certain lesser included offenses, and that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. The court found that no error was committed and there was substantial and sufficient evidence to support the jury's guilty verdict. One of the court's conclusions was that the absence of an express requirement of temporal proximity in &sect; 18-2-301 did not render the definition of criminal solicitation void for vagueness, nor was the statute overbroad.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge claiming that the perjury statute,&nbsp;Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-8-502 (1978) was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court denied the motion. After two trials, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. The trial court reconsidered defendant's motion and dismissed the charge. The trial court reasoned that there must have been some constitutional defect in the perjury statute because the jury had failed to agree upon a verdict in a clear-cut perjury case. The court reversed. The court found that the applicable standard for determining whether the statute was unconstitutionally vague was whether it failed to reasonably forewarn persons of ordinary intelligence of what was prohibited. Further, said law must have lent itself to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement because it failed to provide explicit standards for those applying it. The court held that the standard applied by the trial court was wholly improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that serving the prosecuting attorney during the trial itself with a written specification of his alibi defense and the names and addresses of alibi witnesses was a disclosure made within a reasonable time within the intendment of Colo.

The court held that the record did not permit it to determine whether the trial court properly exercised or improperly abused its discretion in imposing the exclusion sanction of Colo. R. Crim. P. 12.1. The court found that the trial court failed to give any reasons for its exclusion of the alibi evidence. Therefore the court was unable to determine whether the court properly exercised its discretion in so ruling. The court found that the appropriate procedure under these circumstances was to vacate the judgment of conviction and to remand the case to the trial court for a proper consideration of the factors enumerated above in determining whether there was good cause to admit the alibi evidence notwithstanding defendant's failure to timely disclose his alibi defense and alibi witnesses to the prosecuting attorney.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 18-7-104 was unconstitutionally vague because it was undefined and that the definition of &quot;patently offensive&quot; in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-7-101(4) was unconstitutionally overbroad because those words were defined in terms of community standards of decency rather than in terms of tolerance. The court also concluded that the presumption of knowledge contained in Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Commercial bookstores and publishers' associations sought a declaration that the Sexually Explicit Materials Harmful to Children Act (Act), Colo.

The trial court concluded that &sect; 18-7-502(5), the display provision, and &sect; 18-7-503, the exemption provisions, were unconstitutional but severed the invalid provisions rather than declaring the entire Act unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, holding that the display part of the statute could not be upheld because it infringed upon the booksellers' right to sell adult materials and an adult's ability to purchase them, thus violating both U.S. Const. amend.

However, the court reversed in part, and held the entire Act to be unconstitutional, concluding that if the unconstitutional provisions were severed as provided in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-7-504, the Act would then violate the commercial bookstores' rights to equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The metropolitan park and recreation district was created in 1955 by a court order.

In 1968 the taxpayer purchased some residential property in the district. Although it had been subject to assessment for tax purposes at the time of purchase, the taxpayer used it in its public utility operations and considered it excluded under the 1955 order. The assessor disagreed and assessed the property for taxation. The taxpayer unsuccessfully protested. The court affirmed the administrative and trial court decisions and held that the taxpayer's new property, acquired 13 years after the initial order excluding its property from taxation, was not exempted from taxation by the order and was subject to taxation for the benefit of the district.

The bond submission questions were approved at the election. A complaint was filed by a nonprofit vendor that was required to collect and return the tax to the city. It alleged that the admissions tax was unlawful and unconstitutional. Two other individuals who had attended events and had paid the tax were also plaintiffs. Upon motion, the district court certified two classes, vendors and attendees, under Colo. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3) but upheld the ordinance as lawful. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the vendor lacked standing to challenge the tax; (2) the members of the ticket purchaser class were not bound by the judgment because of inadequate notice; and (3) the use of the admissions tax proceeds to retire the stadium bonds neither worked an illegal change in the bond ordinance approved by the voters nor was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 18-3-402, -302, 18-2-101, 8 (1978).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's arrest, a police detective secured separate warrants to search defendant's car and home. The affidavit prepared by the detective set forth in detail the results of the investigation and identified defendant's home address as the place to be searched. The detective, however, inadvertently failed to allege facts in the affidavit that linked defendant to the residence that was to be searched. After search warrants were issued, police seized evidence used at trial. Defendant sought to suppress the evidence, claiming that the supporting affidavit failed to establish probable cause as required by Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7. The lower court refused to suppress the evidence and concluded that the detective's failure to link defendant to the location specified in the affidavit constituted a good faith mistake under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-3-308. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction and stated that reversible error did not occur.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lured a 12-year-old boy into his house. He then offered the boy money if the boy would masturbate with defendant. The boy refused. Defendant was convicted of attempted inducement of child prostitution. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant argued that the statute he was convicted of violating was vague. The court found that the statute evinced a clear legislative intent to prohibit the sexual exploitation of children by monetary or other economic inducement. Defendant's conduct of offering the victim money to masturbate in his presence constituted one type of conduct that the general assembly intended to punish. Defendant's vagueness claim was therefore without merit. The evidence supported the trial court's finding that defendant, by his words and actions, made an overt attempt to persuade the victim to masturbate for money in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-7-405.5.</SPAN></P>

The mining company appealed. The mining company contended that it made a discovery within the terms of &sect; 36-1-140 so as to have required the board to issue an exploration permit. The court found that it was undisputed that the mining company took no steps upon the state land leading to the alleged discovery of coal. The mining company did not seek the permission of the board to have entered upon the land and the only exploration hole was dug adjacent to the land.

The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the statutory scheme of &sect; 11-51-104(1) supported the requirement of obtaining a license even if the securities or transactions were exempt. The court found that the licensing provision was not contingent upon dealers or salesmen engaging in the sale of registered securities. The court also found that the statute failed to provide an exemption from licensing for persons dealing in exempt securities or transactions in any of the definitional provisions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mining corporations brought suit against the town, seeking to have the town's watershed ordinance declared invalid and to permanently enjoin its enforcement. The District Court of Gunnison County (Colorado) held that the ordinance unconstitutionally conflicted with several state and federal statutes, granting the mining corporations' motion for summary judgment and enjoining the town from enforcing the ordinance. The town appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town argued that summary judgment was not appropriate because the ordinance was a proper exercise of its statutory authority to protect its water works from injury and was not preempted by federal or state statutes. The court refused to reach the merits of the town's argument because the factual record in the case was not sufficiently developed for final resolution by summary judgment. The mining corporations failed to prove the extent that the ordinance would detrimentally affect their operations. Therefore, there were several unresolved factual questions relating to the existence, nature, and extent of any injury that the mining corporations might have sustained under the ordinance. The award of summary judgment was based on assumed facts, which were mere hypothetical possibilities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The summary judgment and the grant of permanent injunctive relief were reversed, and the cause was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

In a consolidated appeal the court, affirming the judgments of the trial courts, held that the act was constitutional. The court found that (1) the act prohibited only the advertising of items to be used with illegal substances and intended as drug paraphernalia; and (2) because the act only affected commercial speech related to illegal activities, it did not reach constitutionally protected conduct, and thus an overbreadth challenge failed. The court found the phrase &quot;intended,&quot; in the section defining drug paraphernalia as any machine, instrument, tool, equipment, or device primarily designed and &quot;intended&quot; for certain uses, was unconstitutionally vague because it did not expressly state whose intent was relevant and thus severed the phrase from that section. The court further found that, although the act allowed a trial judge to make an initial determination as to whether certain items were drug paraphernalia before presenting a jury with evidence to determine the issue, the act did not deny the accused his right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted defendants' motion and suppressed all pen register and toll record evidence obtained without a search warrant, along with all surveillance evidence derived from the toll records and pen register. The court also suppressed all wiretap evidence because without the pen register and toll record evidence, the affidavit failed to establish probable cause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the District Court of Kit Carson County (Colorado), which convicted him for attempted sale of a counterfeit controlled substance in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-5-306 (Supp. 1982). Defendant claimed that &sect; 18-5-306, Colorado's counterfeit controlled substance statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, extended beyond the State's police power, and impermissibly created a strict liability offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two transactions, defendant sold various tablets and capsules to an undercover agent and falsely represented that the &quot;drugs&quot; contained an amphetamine, a controlled substance. The pills were actually composed solely of caffeine. After unsuccessfully moving to dismiss the two charges of dispensing a counterfeit controlled substance on the grounds that the counterfeit controlled substance statute was unconstitutional, defendant pled guilty to the attempted sale of a counterfeit substance while reserving his right to appeal the constitutionality of the statute. On appeal by a disapproved procedure, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for the attempted sale of a counterfeit substance by upholding the constitutionality of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-5-306, which was not subject to attack on either vagueness or overbreadth grounds. As the mental state of &quot;knowingly&quot; was implied as to the underlying nature of the substance and was statutorily required for a conviction, &sect; 18-5-306 did not create a strict liability offense. As the statute regulated a legitimate subject directly related to the public's health and welfare, it was not an impermissible exercise of the State's police power.</SPAN></P>

The information charged that defendant had knowingly recommended, prescribed, and administered medical treatment without a valid license to practice medicine. Defendant filed a motion for a bill of particulars requesting that the state set forth the specific dates and times each alleged offense was committed. The state was unable to provide a more specific date and time beyond what was alleged in the information. A jury found defendant guilty of seven counts of unlawfully practicing medicine and eight counts of felony theft. On appeal, the court affirmed. The state's failure to provide a more detailed bill of particulars did not constitute grounds for reversal. The information by itself provided defendant with adequate notice of the charges against him. Each count of the information specified the victim's name, the alleged crime committed, and the approximate date that the alleged acts occurred. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-36-106, under which defendant was charged, was not unconstitutionally vague and defendant lacked standing to raise the issue of the alleged overbreadth of the statute.</SPAN></P>

(1973). The District Court, Saguache County (Colorado) entered judgement for the board, and the owners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the evidence was sufficient to prove that the public had adversely used the road for 20 consecutive years. In so ruling, the court held that a gate at the foot of the road was not conclusive proof that the owners objected to the public's use. Rather, the gate was erected primarily for the benefit of ranchers, in order to protect their livestock from entering onto an adjacent highway. Further, the gate was not locked, and the owners were aware of the public's entry onto their property through the gate. The owners were not deprived of equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25, because the statute at issue applied with equal force to all private property owners. It was irrelevant that private property owners were prohibited from exercising the same right of forfeiture against property held in the public domain. The court also held that there was no governmental taking in contravention of Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 15, because the state was entitled to condition ownership on the owners' action to prohibit public use or to make manifest his objection to it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged the evidence failed to support his second degree forgery conviction under &sect; 18-5-103. The court disagreed finding defendant's conviction was based on his use of grocery receipts to inflate the income of an organization in which he was the organizer and primary fiscal controller of. The court held the People failed to establish the instrument itself was false or fictitious or that defendant knew the instrument was false or fictitious under 8 Colo. Rev, Stat. 18-5-101 (1978). The court held defendant's charitable fraud conviction under &sect; 18-5-115(1)(a) had to be set aside as the statute was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant argued two of his three theft convictions were improper as the information did not adequately inform him of the offenses under 8 Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-5-202 (1978). The court held the information satisfied the requirements of &sect; 16-5-202 and the crime of theft may have been perpetuated over a continuing period under 8 Colo. Rev. Stat. 18-4-404(4) (1978). The court held defendant's child abuse conviction under &sect; 18-6-404(1)(a) was proper, and he was not denied his right to trial by a jury representative of a fair cross section of the community.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded. The court held that the board did not adequately disclose the basis of its decision to terminate the teacher. In essence, there was an insufficient record for review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1978, Colorado adopted Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-27-102, which provided for a 5 cent reduction in gasoline tax for gasohol containing at least 10 percent alcohol manufactured in Colorado and derived from agricultural and forest products. At that time, there were no Colorado producers of fuel-grade alcohol. In 1979, the seller began selling fuel-grade alcohol to Colorado gasohol producers. In 1981, the first Colorado-produced fuel-grade alcohol became available for blending with gasoline. Gasohol blended with Colorado alcohol was eligible for the nickel tax break under &sect; 39-27-102 while gasoline blended with alcohol produced by the seller was not. Since the time Colorado-produced alcohol became available, the seller sold substantially less fuel-grade alcohol in Colorado. The court affirmed the judgment and held that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39-27-102(1)(a)(III) did not violate the Commerce Clause because it was rationally related to the legitimate governmental purpose of providing a limited incentive for the production of fuel-grade alcohol and did not impermissibly burden interstate commerce.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state filed an interlocutory appeal challenging a ruling of the Arapahoe County District Court (Colorado), which suppressed various items of evidence at defendant's trial for attempted first degree murder, second degree kidnapping, child abuse, sexual assault on a child, and a crime of violence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allowed federal agents and local police to look around his home while he was interviewed concerning a child abduction. After a witness identified defendant's car, it was towed and searched. Defendant took a polygraph examination, was advised of his Miranda rights, and signed a waiver consenting to the prior searches. He later told an agent where the child could be found. The district court granted defendant's motion to suppress the items seized from his home and car and his statements. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part the suppression order. The court held that (1) the seizure of the items from the home exceeded the scope of defendant's consent; (2) the seizure of the car was valid under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement because the mobility of the car created a sufficient exigency to warrant immediate seizure; and (3) defendant's statements after the polygraph examination were voluntary because defendant was not under arrest. The court remanded the case to determine the constitutionality of admitting the statements made at defendant's home because the district court's standard for custodial interrogation was unduly restrictive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the suppression of items seized from defendant's home. The court reversed the district court's order suppressing the items seized from defendant's car. The court remanded with directions for the district court to determine the constitutionality of admitting defendant's statements to federal agents while his home was searched.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that his convictions for first degree felony murder and second degree murder could not stand because only one conviction of murder was permitted for the killing of one victim. In addition, he argued that there were errors in the jury instructions, that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, and that there was prosecutorial misconduct. The court reversed defendant's second degree murder conviction because there was only one victim. The court affirmed the convictions for first degree felony murder and conspiracy to commit robbery because defendant was in immediate flight from a robbery when he shot and killed the security guard. The shooting was intended to facilitate his flight from the scene and to enhance his chance of escape. These acts were within the felony of attempted robbery. In addition, defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because there was no evidence that defendant was prejudiced by defense counsel's lack of knowledge of grants of immunity. Furthermore, the prosecutor's statement regarding the death penalty, though improper, did not require a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of manslaughter and criminal abortion and on appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the remaining portions of Colorado's criminal abortion statute retained sufficient substance to permit enforcement of the legislative intent, which was to protect the health of the woman. The court found that the phrase &quot;accepted medical procedures&quot; as used in the criminal abortion statute was not inherently vague and uncertain and that it was sufficiently definitive to appraise defendant of the proscribed conduct. The trial court did not err in permitting testimony concerning the woman's hearsay statements under Colo. R. Evid. 803(2) because the statement qualified as an excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. The court determined that the trial court also did not abuse its discretion in admitting a graphic photograph when the challenged photograph was necessary to contradict statements made by defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of vehicular homicide and vehicular assault and appealed the convictions, asserting that police officers violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend.

The court affirmed the convictions, holding that the constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures required only that there had been probable cause to place defendant under arrest before the blood sample was taken. The court determined that the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant and to obtain a blood specimen without consent because (1) the officer knew that an accident had occurred, which resulted in several deaths and injuries; (2) defendant's car was on the wrong side of the road at the time of the collision; (3) each of the two occupants of defendant's car claimed the other was driving; and (4) the officer noted a presence of alcohol on their breaths.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the administrators' motions to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings, and directed entry of judgment in favor of the administrators. Upon review, the court affirmed, holding that the Policemen's and Firemen's Pension Reform Law was constitutional. The court held that although certain portions of the 1978 Act were struck down, the Policemen's and Firemen's Pension Reform Law was not retroactive legislation as applied to plaintiffs. The court held that the remedy to the ailing pension system addressed by the legislature was afforded only if the non-vesting provision of the 1978 Act was construed as severable. The court held the legislature clearly and unequivocally expressed its desire in both the 1979 Act and the 1981 Act that fire fighters and police officers hired after April 7, 1978, be covered by the new pension system.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case was referred to the court from the appellate court because the constitutionality of the Act was in question. The worker alleged that he was employed as an independent contractor, that he sustained injuries in a roof collapse, and that the general contractor was liable for damages under tort law. The worker's wife sought damages for loss of consortium. On appeal, the court affirmed. The worker was a subcontractor of the general contractor's subcontractor, and the exclusive remedy for his injuries and his wife's derivative claims was under the Act. The general contractor had tort immunity against plaintiffs' negligence claims under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-48-101(2) (Supp. 1983), granted in exchange for the worker's compensation liability imposed by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-48-101(1) (Supp. 1983). The worker, while he was a subcontractor, was both an employer and an employee covered by the Act. The worker, in his role as a subcontractor, had obtained workers' compensation coverage, and the general contractor enjoyed tort immunity as a result. The purpose of the Act was achieved in that the general contractor and its downstream subcontractors carried workers' compensation insurance.</SPAN></P>

The District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) granted summary judgment in favor of the doctor on the basis that the claims were barred by the three-year statute of repose found in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-105(1973). The patient and his wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the patient and his wife contended that the statute of repose of &sect; 13-80-105&nbsp;unconstitutionally discriminated against negligently misdiagnosed plaintiffs by depriving them of the discovery rule contained in two statutory exceptions to the repose provision. The court agreed and reversed the summary judgment for the doctor. The patient must be included within the class excepted from the statute of repose. The court applied a rational basis standard and held &sect; 13-80-105, insofar as it applied to negligent misdiagnosis claimants, violated the equal protection clause of the Colorado Constitution. The statutory exceptions, which permitted &quot;foreign object&quot; and &quot;knowing concealment&quot; claimants, but not &quot;negligently misdiagnosed&quot; plaintiffs to avoid the statute of repose and to invoke the discovery rule, had no reasonable basis in fact and created an arbitrary classification. The classification that resulted in the denial of the discovery rule to patients whose conditions were negligently misdiagnosed did not further the governmental interest of preserving medical malpractice claims where the claimant sustained an injury but lacked any reasonable opportunity to discover the cause.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the airport authority was not a necessary party to a review of the constitutionality of agency action under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-106 (1982). Although Colo. Const. art. X, &sect; 6 prohibited exemption from taxation of any property not specified as exempt in art. X, the court held that the exemption for public property in Colo. Const. art.

The court held that the trial court properly refused defendant's jury instruction for criminally negligent homicide as a lesser included offense because the establishment of the essential elements of vehicular homicide did not necessarily establish all the elements required for criminally negligent homicide.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff homeowners appealed from the Jefferson County District Court (Colorado), which declared that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-127(1)(a) (1973 &amp; 1983 Cum. Supp.) did not violate constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the law and dismissed the homeowners' claims against defendant builder for damages to their residence on the basis of the statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The homeowners bought a home from the builder and purchased a warranty from the homeowners warranty corporation (HOW). The homeowners filed an action against the builder alleging that the home had structural damage that was discovered during an inspection by HOW. The builder filed a motion for summary judgment and argued that the claims were barred by the two-year statute of limitations under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-127(1)(a) (1973 &amp; 1983 Cum. Supp.). The trial court granted the motion, and the homeowners appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that &sect; 13-80-127(1)(a), which provided that actions against builders be brought within two years after the claim for relief arose, did not violate federal or state constitutional equal protection guarantees because the builder classification in the statute was reasonably related to a legitimate state interest. The court ruled that the legislature, in &sect; 13-80-127(1)(b), had distinguished discovery of the defect which caused the injury from the injury itself, and that the time of the homeowners' discovery set forth a genuine issue of material fact that could not be resolved by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed with respect to its conclusion that the statute did not violate equal protection guarantees of the constitutions of the United States and Colorado.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on his investigation of the motel television theft, the arresting officer identified defendant as the primary suspect and learned that he also had two outstanding arrest warrants. One of the warrants was for a stolen vehicle, which matched the description of the vehicle that defendant had been driving when he was at the motel. Outside of his jurisdiction, the officer later spotted the stolen vehicle, with defendant driving. The officer radioed the local police department that he intended to stop defendant and requested local police assistance. The officer stopped and detained defendant and his companions for four to six minutes until local police arrived. After they confirmed the existence of the outstanding warrants against defendant, they surrendered his custody to the arresting officer. While in custody, defendant confessed to the television theft. The court held that defendant's arrest was properly authorized because the officer properly enlisted the aid of local police and had probable cause. The court held that Colo. R. Crim.

The arrest was based on an erroneously issued arrest warrant for an unpaid traffic fine and found to be in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by a police officer for exceeding the speed limit. The officer called in and was told by the dispatcher that there was an outstanding arrest warrant for defendant for failure to pay a previous traffic fine. The officer arrested defendant and took him to the police station where he was searched. A small amount of illegal drugs were found in his pocket and he was charged with possession of a controlled substance. It was later determined that the warrant had been issued in error, since defendant had actually paid the traffic fine prior to the issuance of the warrant. The trial court ruled that defendant's arrest was based on a warrant that was void from its issuance and accordingly suppressed any evidence seized from defendant as the product of an unconstitutional arrest. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court held that defendant's arrest on the basis of an erroneously issued arrest warrant violated his constitutional rights and that neither the good faith mistake nor technical violation exceptions to the exclusionary rule under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-3-308 (1973) were applicable.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 18-6-401(1)(a) (1973) (1978 Rep. Vol. 8 and 1983 Supp.) was dismissed. On appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that defendant's mental state and the prohibited conduct's result determined the offense grade. Because Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-401(7)(a) applied when death or injury resulted and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-401(7)(b) applied otherwise, the court found that the statute was constitutional because it did not prescribe different penalties for the same act. The court held that re-trying the case would not equal prosecutorial misconduct, finding judicial interference with the district attorney's executive discretion unjustified. The court also held that evidence of the parents' violence, a child abuse complaint against the father, and a neighbor's testimony, was relevant because it supported the inference that the child could have been injured by a parent. Because the trial court justifiably declared a mistrial and did not abuse its discretion by refusing to give a modified Allen charge, the court held that a re-trial would not violate defendant's double jeopardy protections.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court had reviewed the Act under an unduly rigid concept of the constitutional requirements, and found that the challenged provisions were consistent with the state constitution.

Although the patient had already been released, the trial court held that his challenge was not moot, but that the statutory provisions satisfied due process, and the court affirmed. The court held that the patient had standing, because he had alleged an injury in fact to a legally protected interest. Balancing the patient's interest in his liberty, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of that interest through the procedures in place, the probable value of additional safeguards, and the fiscal and administrative burdens additional procedures would place upon government, the court held that the existing protections satisfied due process.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State applied for a writ of certiorari to review a decision of the District Court, Boulder County (Colorado), which affirmed a county court ruling suppressing visual observations and other evidence obtained by a police officer after stopping defendant motorist on suspicion of a traffic violation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant motorist was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Defendant filed a motion to suppress all evidence obtained from him on the ground that such evidence was the fruit of an unconstitutional search and seizure in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7. The county court ordered the suppression of the evidence and the district court affirmed. The court held that the officer's order to get out of the vehicle and walk to the rear, issued after defendant was lawfully stopped, was not an unlawful search or seizure under U.S. Const. amend. IV or Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 7. The court held that the constitutional requirements for a limited intrusion had been met: the officer's initial stop was based on a reasonable suspicion of a traffic violation; ordering defendant to walk to the rear of the vehicle served a reasonable purpose; and the scope and character of the intrusion were reasonably related to its purpose. The court reversed the decision of the district court and remanded for further proceedings on the issue of whether defendant consented to the search.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the State challenged a judgment of the District Court, Fourth Judicial District (Colorado), which, on a Colo. R. Crim. P. 35 motion, granted defendant credit for 4 months and 15 days against a sentence for conspiracy to commit second degree burglary of a dwelling. The trial court also ordered the Department of Corrections to award defendant statutory good time credit for this period of presentence confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's other Rule 35 claims were denied by the trial court. Both defendant and the State appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held as follows: (1) the failure of the sentencing judge to consider defendant's presentence confinement at the sentencing hearing, violated the statutory mandate of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-306 (1973) and rendered the sentence subject to later correction under Colo. R. Crim. P. 35(c)(2)(IV); (2) the trial court, therefore, had jurisdiction to consider defendant's claim to presentence confinement credit and also had discretion to award such credit against the sentence; (3) the trial court erred in its award of good time credit to defendant because there was no constitutional right to good time credit for presentence confinement; and (4) nor was there any statutory right to such credit in 1975, when the sentence in question was imposed because by virtue of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 17-22.5-101 (Supp. 1983), good-time credit existed only in the case of crimes committed on or after July 1, 1979.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed those parts of the judgment that granted defendant credit for 4 months and 15 days presentence confinement, that denied him credit for the period of parole spent in federal custody, and that denied him credit for county jail confinement on a parole violation while he was awaiting prosecution on a new fraud by check charge. The court reversed that part of the judgment crediting defendant with statutory good time credit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with violating Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-5-306(2). They filed motions to dismiss because the statute was facially unconstitutional. The motions were granted because the &quot;reasonable person&quot; standard was either vague or overbroad. The state appealed, and, on review, the court held that the &quot;reasonable person&quot; standard in &sect; 18-5-306(1)(b) was subject to constitutional construction: it referred to the significance attributed to the physical characteristics of the substance obvious to a prospective purchaser. The prosecution had to prove that the counterfeit controlled substance looked reasonably like a controlled substance. Because a crime ordinarily required both an act and a culpable mental state, legislative silence as to intent did not indicate that no culpable mental state was required. Conversely, the requisite mental state was implied from the statute. The court concluded that &quot;knowingly&quot; was implied by the counterfeit controlled substances statute and was required for a conviction. In reversing, the court found that the &quot;reasonable person&quot; standard was neither unconstitutionally vague nor did it contain an unconstitutional mental state requirement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment, finding that the intent element was implicit in the statute and that it was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an original proceeding, the People of the State of Colorado requested that the court issue a rule to show cause why respondent district court should not be ordered to reinstate habitual criminal counts against a defendant after the district court held Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-103 (1973, 1983 Supp.), a part of the Colorado habitual-criminal statute, unconstitutional. The court issued the rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with various crimes, including four counts of being a habitual criminal. The question was whether, due to the same-jury requirement in &sect; 16-13-103, defendant could have an impartial jury during the habitual-criminal sentencing hearing. The district court declared a part of the statute unconstitutional and dismissed the habitual criminal counts. The People obtained a rule to show cause. The court made the rule absolute and held that &sect; 16-13-103 was constitutional. The court rejected the argument that &sect; 16-13-103 violated the constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury by requiring that the separate sentencing hearing be held before the same jury that sat for the trial on the substantive offenses. The bifurcated system had built-in constitutional safeguards and other jurisdictions that adopted such systems, as well as court decisions evaluating those procedures, supported the court's conclusion that &sect; 16-13-103 was constitutional. Given the nature of what had to be proven in order to convict a defendant of habitual criminality, the court was satisfied that the use of the same jury would not result in a guilty verdict based primarily on bias or prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court made the rule to show cause regarding Colorado's habitual criminal statute absolute, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff religious society appealed an order of the District Court of Pueblo County (Colorado), which denied its request for attorney's fees under the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Award Act of 1976 (CRAFA), 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988, relative to the religious society's civil rights action against defendants, state fair commission, its members, and state officials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The religious society sought to enjoin the enforcement of a resolution, which restricted the exercise of religion in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendment, and the Colorado Constitution. The determination that the resolution unconstitutionally limited the religious society's free exercise rights was affirmed. Nevertheless, the lower court denied the religious society's request for attorney's fees based on precedent that it found contradicted the result reached. On appeal, the religious society contended that it was entitled to attorney's fees as a prevailing party in a civil rights action. The court reversed the lower court's judgment and remanded the matter for an award of attorney's fees. The religious society was a prevailing party under CRAFA because it succeeded on a significant issue and benefitted from that success. Namely, declaratory and permanent injunctive relief was obtained that prohibited the unlawful resolution's enforcement. In the interests of judicial economy, the court also decided that the religious society's complaint stated a claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 because the deprivation of a constitutional right under color of state law was alleged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, it was undisputed that defendant's victim was a prostitute and he was her manager. The trial court denied defendant's challenge for cause to one potential juror who expressed a negative attitude towards the occupations of defendant and the victim. The defense used a peremptory challenge to excuse the potential juror and all of defendant's peremptory challenges were used. Upon expressing surprise at the recommendations in defendant's presentence report, the defense unsuccessfully sought a continuance to allow for sufficient time to produce character evidence to present at the sentencing hearing. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, vacated his sentence, and remanded the case for resentencing. The court found no abuse of discretion in the denial of the challenge for cause raised to dismiss the potential juror, because the trial court found that she would base her decision on the evidence and the jury instructions. Under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-11-102 (Cum.

The court then affirmed, noting that while a home-rule city had a considerable interest in the construction of railroad-highway crossings within its municipal limits under Colo. Const. art.

The inn brought an action for a refund, but the district court found for the division. On appeal, the court reversed and held that &sect; 8-79-103(1) imposed no personal liability upon the inn to pay the individual's delinquent unemployment contributions. The court stated that when an employer's property was encumbered by a lien; any successor took that property subject to the burden of the lien.

The individual brought an action to have Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 25-1-310 (1973) declared unconstitutional and in violation of the Due Process Clause and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25. The district court agreed, finding that the statute provided inadequate standards for determining the qualifications of the facility administrator and that the &quot;clearly dangerous&quot; standard was inadequate in guiding the administrator's decision to commit or release an intoxicated person. Appellants sought review and the court reversed and vacated the judgment, finding that the constitutionality of the statute was not properly before the court because legal issues sufficient to raise the constitutional issue were not presented.

It held that legislative caucus meetings were meetings of policy-making bodies within the meaning of the Law and therefore subject to the Law's requirement that meetings be public meetings open to the public at all times. The court concluded that the Senate and House Representatives had determined that the business of legislative caucuses was not such that it had to be kept secret, so the Law did not conflict with the state constitution. The restraints on the senator's freedom of speech were reasonable and justified in view of the important governmental interest furthered by the law: the public's right of access to public information.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court affirmed, but for different reasons. The court limited the ordinance to knowing conduct, and as limited, upheld it as constitutional. The court found, however, that there was no evidence that defendant knowingly interfered with police officers. The court also found that defendant lacked standing to raise the issues of facial overbreadth or alleged vagueness, except as that vagueness applied to his own conduct. The court determined that the evidence before the municipal court was not sufficient to support defendant's conviction of resisting an officer because the requisite mens rea was not proven. The court held that the ordinance was a codification of the common law crime of obstructing an officer and, as such, the crime necessarily contained an element of mens rea which could be read into the ordinance.

The service organization received 20 percent of the gross proceeds, and the company received the remainder. Thereafter, during the grand jury investigation, a witness testified that defendant said he would sue her if she appeared before the grand jury.

Section 18-5-115(1)(a) created a danger of arbitrary enforcement and violated defendant's due process rights.

The appellate court ruled that the consecutive sentences violated the separation of power doctrine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convicted felon received consecutive life sentences for second-degree murder, aggravated robbery, and possession of dangerous drugs with the intent to dispense, and was found to be an habitual criminal.

The appellate court ruled that the sentences violated the separation of powers doctrine. The state appealed, and the court reversed the appellate court decision, agreeing that the sentences did not have to run concurrently because they were not supported by identical evidence. Although they delayed the time for parole eligibility, they were within the trial court's discretion and did not violate Colo. Const. art. III. The legislature determined periods of confinement, but the judiciary imposed sentences. As long as they were within legislative limits, the trial court had the discretion to order the sentences to run consecutively. Evidence was needed to justify very long sentences but the trial court here did not abuse its discretion in ordering consecutive sentences for the seven-time felon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court reversed. The trial court's restrictions prevented effective cross-examination of defendant's stepson and violated defendant's right of confrontation. The defense counsel attempted to show that the stepson had criminal charges pending against him, had lied when he testified that he was living with his stepfather and not in juvenile detention, and resented his parents for placing restrictions on him due to his trouble with the law. Had these facts been brought to the jury, it could have evaluated whether the stepson's testimony was influenced by a desire to obtain leniency from the state in his own cases. The evidence supported the ruling of the trial court that, under the totality of the circumstances, at the time of the fire, defendant voluntarily relinquished his burned pants to the fire investigator.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court declared both statutes unconstitutional because they denied the accused the opportunity to rebut the presumption raised by his or her blood alcohol content. The court held that the decision to require proof of proximate cause in criminal proceedings relating to the operation of a motor vehicle represented a rational choice among many public policy alternatives. The court concluded that the phrase &quot;proximate cause&quot; was sufficiently intelligible to satisfy both federal and Colorado constitutional standards of due process of law. The court held that the legislature had not ignored the fact that operating or driving a motor vehicle required conscious mental activity in establishing the offenses of causing injury or death by driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of a drug or an intoxicant. The court reasoned that the prosecution had to prove voluntary conduct, as defined by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-501(9), in the operation or driving of a motor vehicle to secure a conviction under either of these statutes. The court reversed the judgment, holding that the trial court erred in concluding that the statutes did not require proof of the defendant's mental state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in 1975 for extreme indifference murder under the statutory proscription for that offense as it was originally enacted at Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40-3-102(1)(d) (1963). In 1981, defendant filed a motion pursuant to Colo. R. Crim. P. 35 to vacate the conviction on the ground that the conviction violated the Colorado constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws because the statutory elements of extreme indifference murder were indistinguishable from second degree murder. The district court rejected the argument and denied the motion. On review, the court also found the argument to be without merit and affirmed the district court. The court held that the culpability element of &quot;intentionally&quot; in extreme indifference murder did not require a specific intent. General intent, when coupled with the additional statutory element of acting under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life, rendered the statutory crime of extreme indifference murder sufficiently distinguishable from second degree murder, which required a specific intent to cause the death of a particular person.</SPAN></P>

The student requested an administrative hearing to protest the extension, claiming that he never received notice of either suspension in violation of his constitutional due process rights. On judicial review, the trial court affirmed the suspensions. On appeal, the court affirmed, rejecting the student's argument that the methods used by the DMV to notify purported non-resident traffic offenders were so unconstitutionally deficient as to violate his due process rights. Rather, the court concluded that the DMV was not required to ascertain an out-of-state traffic offender's permanent address, noting that when the student signed each traffic ticket, he was put on notice that he was required to appear.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue in this case were three questions: 1.) Whether certain of the corporation's sales constituted Colorado sales; (2) Whether dividends paid by a subsidiary were to be apportioned or were to be allocated to Texas; and 3.) Whether interest paid by the subsidiary was to be apportioned or allocated to Texas. The court held that: 1.) Under the Multistate Tax Compact (Compact), to which Colorado was a party, the corporation could elect to apportion its income according to the provisions of the Compact or under the regular Colorado corporate income tax apportionment provisions, codified at Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-60-1301 et seq. (1973); 2.) When goods were delivered to an intermediary for wrapping and then shipped by common carrier to an out-of-state purchaser there was no Colorado sale for income tax purposes; 3.) Because the interest derived from short-term notes was an integral part of the corporation's business, the interest income was business income apportionable to Colorado; and 4.) Because the corporation did not satisfy its burden of showing that there was other than a &quot;fair apportionment&quot; of its taxes, there was no violation of the Commerce Clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the felony charge of possession of hashish. He was not charged with the lesser offense of possession of crude marihuana. The People presented evidence showing that hashish, though derived from the marihuana plant, was extracted directly from the plant's resin, which was more concentrated in THC than crude marihuana. At the close of the evidence, the trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charges on the grounds that the definition of marihuana was broad enough to include hashish, therefore, there was no reasonable basis to support the felony classification and the harsher penalty for possession of hashish. On appeal, the court determined that hashish posed a more serious danger to the public than a similar amount of crude marihuana due to the fact that the higher concentration of THC in hashish was likely to produce a greater alteration in a user's conscious state, with concomitant distortions of perception. Thus, the court concluded, there was a reasonable basis for the legislature's decision to classify hashish as a marihuana concentrate and to punish that possession offense more severely than possession of crude marihuana.</SPAN></P>

Vol. 1B 1980) and holding that the nonprofit group's fund-raising, combined with its signature-gathering procedure for referendum petitions, violated &sect; 1-40-110.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The nonprofit group sought to hire people to gather signatures for an initiative petition and to solicit donations. Those people were to be paid a percentage of the donations they collected. The nonprofit group then filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment that its proposed method of petition circulation did not violate Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1-40-110 (Repl. Vol. 1B 1980). The trial court entered a judgment declaring that the nonprofit group's petition circulation method was prohibited by &sect; 1-40-110, which was ruled to be constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court ruled that the issues raised by the nonprofit group were not moot, although the targeted elections had been held, because the issues were capable of repetition yet evaded review. The court ruled that &sect; 1-40-110 improperly limited the right to initiate legislation in violation of Colo. Const. art. V, &sect; 1 because it prohibited anyone with a direct or indirect financial incentive from circulating petitions. Thus, it was overbroad. When &sect; 1-40-110 was given an appropriately narrow construction, the court ruled that the non-profit group's proposed circulation method was permissible.</SPAN></P>

That instruction did not constitute plain error and did not prejudice defendant. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient to affirm defendant's conviction for attempted robbery. The court reversed defendant's conviction for attempted second degree sexual assault because the touching of the victim by defendant and his request that she go to his apartment, without more, was insufficient evidence to establish any &quot;intent&quot; to commit the crime of second-degree sexual assault and that the touching did not constitute a substantial step toward the commission of the underlying offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Director of Excise and Licenses for the City and County of Denver (director) suspended licensee's cabaret license after finding that the licensee had violated a municipal ordinance prohibiting it from admitting persons under the age of 18. The licensee filed a review proceeding under the State Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-101 et seq. (1982 Repl.), and under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106, seeking review of the director's decision. The district court set aside the director's order, holding that the applicable municipal ordinance was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the question of the constitutionality of the ordinance was not properly before the district court because the city's licensing department was not a state &quot;agency&quot; within the ambit of review procedures under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-106 of the APA. Because review of decisions under Colo. R. Civ. P. 106 was limited whether to the director exceeded his jurisdiction or abused its discretion and the record supported the director's finding that the licensee violated the ordinance, the court ordered that the director's decision be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

Defendant received a commission from such sales. He was convicted of sexual exploitation of children and the judgment was affirmed on appeal. The court first held that defendant did not sustain his burden of proving that &sect; 18-6-403 was unconstitutionally vague. The court then held that the provision was not overbroad. It did not reach constitutionally-protected conduct, because child pornography was not material protected by the First Amendment or Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 10. The court also found that defendant's conduct fell within the prohibitory language of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-6-403 (Supp. 1980). Defendant did not assert that the photographs and magazines he sold had any serious artistic, literary, political, scientific, or medical value. Finally, the court rejected defendant's claim that an element of &sect; 18-6-403 was social, developmental, or emotional injury to the children depicted in the pornographic materials.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-51-806 (1982 Repl. Vol. 10) regarding the payment of an annuity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor's father was a contributing member of PERA, and was divorced from his mother, who had custody of the minor. The father had remarried and established a separate household with children. The father died and PERA concluded that under &sect; 24-51-806 the widow and children's annuity payable to the father's second wife operated to preclude the payment of an annuity to the minor. On appeal, the court affirmed PERA's ruling because there was no statutory authorization for the payment of an annuity to the minor as long as the conditions of eligibility for the widow and children continued to exist. The statutory language limiting the children's annuity to situations where no annuities had been payable under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-51-804 or &sect; 24-51-805 was not designed to prevent double recovery, but instead was intended to create a statutory ranking of potential classes of claimants. The PERA annuity statutes did not violate equal protection of the laws because they were reasonably related to a legitimate government interest in providing the dependents of public employees with some maintenance in the event of the employee's death .</SPAN></P>

The jury found defendant guilty on the basis of his statement to a prospective purchaser that he owned a parcel of land when in reality he had merely contracted to purchase the land and had not yet acquired title. Defendant contended that &sect; 18-5-302(2) was unconstitutionally vague, that there was insufficient evidence to submit the charge to the jury, and that the jury instructions were inadequate. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that the term &quot;ownership interest in land,&quot; in the context of a false representation made to another, was not so vague or uncertain that persons of ordinary intelligence had to guess its meaning. The court concluded that &sect; 18-5-302(2) required actual reliance by the victim, without regard to how a reasonable person might have understood the misrepresentation, and that this requirement of actual reliance satisfied due process.

The city refused arbitration. The union filed a complaint based on the city's breach of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. The district court granted the union's motion for summary judgment and the appellate court affirmed. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that binding grievance arbitration of disputes arising under the terms of a public employment collective bargaining agreement was not per se unconstitutional as a delegation of legislative authority because the arbitrator's function was judicial, making factual findings relating to the particular grievance and to interpret and apply specific contract provisions. The court held that parties to a collective bargaining agreement would not be tempted to resolve other disputes under the guise of grievance arbitration because it would be in the parties' interest to have the essential terms and conditions of employment established, rather than leave them undecided until a future date. The union's claim was arbitrable because it required interpretation and application of standards of employer conduct agreed to by the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The primary issue involved was whether aggravated robbery was a lesser included offense of felony murder because it considered &quot;robbery,&quot; which was an underlying felony for felony murder, a generic category which included all types of robbery. The court reasoned that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-408(1)(a) prohibited multiple convictions for more than one offense if one offense was included in the other, as defined in Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-408(5). The court affirmed the judgment, holding that because defendant's conviction for felony murder was based upon the causation of the robbery victim's death during the course of the robbery, a charge of aggravated robbery of the same victim was a lesser included offense of the felony murder charge within the meaning of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-408(5)(c). The appellate court had ordered a remand to determine whether defendant's statements to the police were the product of a Colo. R. Crim. P. 5(a)(1) violation. The court affirmed this portion of the judgment, holding that because unnecessary and prejudicial delay may have occurred before defendant was advised of his rights by a county or district judge, a remand was necessary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The doctor, a public health officer, claimed that the board discriminatorily and constructively discharged him because he engaged in free speech; that is, warning the public of the dangers to public health of a nearby nuclear production facility.

The court held that although the doctor was an at-will employee, he could be wrongfully discharged in retaliation for free speech if three factors were found. One, was the activity in fact free speech entitled to constitutional protection? As a government employee, the government had more authority to restrict his speech, if, for example, the activity interfered with the board's responsibilities.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1965, the Board contracted to sell water to the city and in 1972, adopted a rule assessing a SDC against all persons and entities coming into the system after January 1, 1973. Before the rule went into effect, the city filed for a declaratory judgment exempting it from the rule. Pending resolution of the suit, the parties agreed that the city would collect the SDC and place the funds in an escrow account. The court held that the city could not be assessed the fee because it came into the system before 1973 and that the residents were also exempt because their rights to the water were derived through and were the same as the city's rights. The court held that the city was properly acting within its discretion in enacting an ordinance in 1975 that assessed a development fee on all persons connecting into its water system after April 1, 1975. The court ruled that the transferors were entitled to a refund of the fees they paid prior to April 1, 1975, and were not deprived of such refund just because they had since sold their property to the landowners. Affirming, the court held that the fees collected after April 1, 1975, belonged to the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The electors filed petitions to recall the directors of a fire protection district. The trial court sustained the petitions. The election was held and the directors were removed from office. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court was guided by two fundamental principles in its review: to successfully challenge the statute, the directors had to prove it was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt; and because the power of recall was a fundamental constitutional right, it had to be liberally construed. The statute was constitutional because it was expressly authorized by Colo. Const. art. XXI, &sect; 4 and the recall of special district directors was a lawful subject for legislation that was not prohibited by art. XXI. The court held that to the extent that decisions in Guyer v. Stutt, 191 P. 120 (1920) and Hall v. Cummings, 213 P. 328 (1923), held that elective officers of subordinate units of state government could not be recalled under Colo. Const. art. XXI, &sect; 4, those cases were overruled. Colo. Const. art.

The court rejected each of defendant's arguments and affirmed the conviction.

The record indicated that those jurors who had heard of the case testified under oath that they could base their verdict solely on the evidence presented at trial. The court also rejected defendant's contentions that the trial court erred in its evidentiary rulings. The trial court did not commit error in admitting a photograph of the victim and her young son; did not improperly limit inquiry into the bias and motive of two prosecution witnesses; and did not improperly permit the late endorsement of a witness.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after he damaged a painting in a university grill. Subsequent to his conviction for criminal mischief pursuant to Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-501 (1978 Repl.), defendant challenged, in part, the constitutionality of the statute and the trial court's failure to grant a new trial due to a juror's inadvertent nondisclosure of his familiarity with a witness. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the crimes of criminal mischief and theft were separate and distinct, so that the different sanctions did not violate equal protection laws. The gravamen of criminal mischief was the knowing causation of damage to another's property, while theft encompassed the taking of property without the element of damage. Because of those differences, the legislature had discretion to place a greater sanction on a criminal mischief offense than a theft offense where the amount of damage was the same. The court also found that the juror's inadvertent failure to disclose that he knew a peripheral prosecution witness was not presumptively prejudicial and did not warrant a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 17-20-107 (1973) (Repl. Vol. 1978) provided good-time credit for state penitentiary prisoners, the denial of good-time credit for presentence confinement violated their constitutional right to equal protection. The trial court denied defendants' motions on jurisdictional grounds. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court had jurisdiction to consider whether defendants' constitutional rights were denied whether or not the Department of Corrections was a party. Further, a rational basis test applied to defendants' equal protection claim because there was no federal or state constitutional right for credit for presentence confinement.

The hearing officer recommended dismissal of the teacher. The Board correctly voted to dismiss the teacher. The court rejected as meritless the teacher's contention that &sect; 22-63-116 was unconstitutionally applied. The Board properly applied &sect; 22-63-116 because the findings of fact demonstrated her &quot;incompetency&quot; and &quot;neglect of duty&quot; as a teacher.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that there was a comprehensive statutory scheme that provided for a right of care and treatment for the developmentally disabled. According to the court, the general assembly provided for the establishment of state-licensed group homes for the developmentally disabled within residential districts. The court determined that the state did not attempt to legislate on a matter of public purely local concern and did not abrogate powers exclusively vested in the city. The court also found that while the homeowners had an interest in protecting their property from zoning changes affecting neighboring uses, this interest did not amount to a vested right in the maintenance of a particular zoning classification. Furthermore, the court held that the homeowners' due process rights were not violated. Finally, the court held that the lease/purchase agreement between the state and a bank did not violate the constitutional prohibition against the state contracting any debt by loan in any form because the bank had no legally enforceable right to require the general assembly to appropriate sufficient funds for lease renewal or to require the state to exercise its option to purchase.</SPAN></P>

Early that day, the woman saw defendant checking out several houses in the neighborhood. The police officers arrived at the scene and questioned defendant and ultimately arrested him. At the time of the arrest, the police officers were unaware of defendant's activities, which were witnessed by the woman. It was not until five hours after the arrest that the police learned that the items taken from defendant were obtained in a burglary. The court held that while defendant's actions were suspicious there was no evidence to establish that defendant committed a crime. Moreover, the court held that the lack of probable cause to arrest could not be remedied by resort to the good faith exception or inevitable discovery rule.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the decision from the District Court of Pueblo County (Colorado), which affirmed the county court's determination that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-202 (1978), which covered cruelty to animals, the crime with which defendant was charged, was unconstitutionally vague. The district court reversed the county court's determination that the statute was overly broad, and defendant cross-appealed that ruling.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the neglect of horses and filed a motion to dismiss on the constitutionality issue. The district court reversed on the overbreadth argument due to a lack of standing. The appellate court affirmed in part. A statute was void for vagueness if it forbade conduct so that persons of common intelligence would have to guess at its meaning and application. A statute only had to provide fair warning, and mathematical exactitude was not required. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-9-201, which defined neglect for purposes of animal cruelty, gave sufficient warning of the proscribed conduct. The appellate court compared the statutory language to child abuse statutes and found that persons of common intelligence would understand that neglect included the failure to provide proper food, water, and shelter. Case law from other states upheld cruelty statutes with similar language. The district court correctly found that defendant did not have standing to challenge the statute for overbreadth. A hypothetical possibility did not create standing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in Oklahoma with burglary. A detective asked him to be videotaped regarding his burglary activities, for use as instruction for police cadets. Defendant appeared, alone, for the interview and signed a release that stated his refusal to give his permission for the videotape to be used in any criminal proceedings against him. He described numerous residential burglaries that he claimed to have committed in the Oklahoma City area. Later he was arrested in Colorado for a series of alleged residential burglaries. Knowing that the prosecution intended to offer the videotape into evidence at trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence. On appeal, the court held that because the officer's promise implicated other constitutional rights of defendant, because he took detrimental action in reasonable reliance upon the promise, and because no other remedy short of enforcement of the promise would secure fundamental fairness to defendant, the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Colorado Constitutions, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 25, required the suppression of the videotape in a pending Colorado prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of criminal attempt to commit extreme indifference after a shooting. The lower court appointed an attorney in private practice to represent defendant due to his financial inability to retain his own attorney. The attorney, during the same period in which this case was being prosecuted, also represented the district attorney in connection with a recall petition and an indictment for overspending his budget. The court reversed the conviction because defendant was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel at trial in violation of U.S. Const. amends. VI and XIV and Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 16. The court held that a lawyer representing such conflicting interests could not avoid being adversely affected at various stages of the criminal prosecution of an accused. She owed her undivided loyalty to both clients. There was a real and substantial conflict that placed the defense attorney in a situation inherently conducive to and productive of divided loyalties. Defendant did not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently relinquish his constitutional right to conflict-free representation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted raping a 13-year-old girl. After an examination and an evidentiary hearing under the Act, he was found to be a sex offender who threatened harm to the public under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-13-207 (1973, 1978 Repl. Vol 8). He claimed that the Act denied him due process and equal protection and was void for vagueness and that his indeterminate sentence was cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed. The court held that the Act was rationally related to the legitimate purpose of protecting the public from sex offenders. The Act's procedural provisions and the yearly review by the parole board that it mandated ensured that defendant's due process rights were protected. The Act did not violate equal protection, as mentally ill people who had not committed crimes were properly afforded greater procedural protections when they were civilly committed. The Act was not void for vagueness; what was prohibited was clear, and procedural safeguards allowed for adequate judicial review. Treatment of criminal defendants was not constitutionally required, and a life sentence was not a per se violation of the Eighth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

Following a hearing, the district court found the evidence to be clear and convincing that the criteria for termination of parental rights were met and also ruled that the parental rights termination statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The district court ordered termination. The court affirmed and held that the evidence, even though circumstantial, was fully sufficient to support termination. The court held the statute was sufficiently definite to provide notice of the conduct or conditions upon which termination of the relationship could be predicated, adequately minimized the potential for arbitrary and discriminatory application, and gave the courts sufficient guidelines to enable them to apply the law consistently and in accord with legislative intent.

During the habitual criminal phase, defendant sought to suppress his prior convictions. The trial court denied his motion to suppress and he was adjudicated an habitual criminal. The court of appeals affirmed the adjudication. The court reversed, finding that a prior conviction for conspiracy to commit escape was constitutionally defective. It held that the elements of a conspiracy were not readily understandable and the record on defendant's conspiracy conviction contained no showing that the elements of conspiracy were explained to him prior to his plea. As such, defendant sustained his initial burden of showing the guilty plea was not understandingly made and the state was required to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the guilty plea was understandingly made; however, the state offered no evidence to support the constitutional validity of the guilty plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's charge arose from an auto accident causing serious injury to another person. When officers arrived, defendant was absent, but later arrived smelling of alcohol. Defendant volunteered to being the driver of one of the cars. The officers placed defendant in a police car and gave the Miranda warning. While in the car defendant gave a written statement about the collision and his activities preceding the accident. The court held that the oral statement volunteered by defendant, though possibly not actually ruled on below, should not be suppressed because defendant volunteered such statement before being addressed by the officers and before being placed in custody. The court held that defendant's detention in the police car and transport to the station for a blood alcohol test was an arrest. There was no evidence in the record that the collision occurred as a result of defendant's misconduct, and defendant's odor of alcohol was not inconsistent with the ability to operate a car in compliance with state law. Hence, the officers did not have probable cause for the arrest, and the order suppressing the written statement given after the arrest was proper.</SPAN></P>

The surviving spouse challenged the judgment of the District Court in and for the City and County of Denver (Colorado), which entered summary judgment in favor of the architects after they raised Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-80-127 (1973) as a defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The architects had designed the hotel. Section 13-80-127 barred suit against an architect for damages for injury to person or property caused by the design or planning of any improvement to real property brought more than 10 years after the substantial completion of the improvement to the real property. The surviving spouse challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 13-80-127. The court held that &sect; 13-80-127 was constitutional. The surviving spouse had the burden of proving unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt and failed to carry that burden of proof. It was not unreasonable for the general assembly to limit to 10 years the period in which suits could be commenced against architects for design defects, in view of the legislative intent to avoid stale claims and the likelihood that most types of defects would reasonably be discovered within 10 years of substantial completion. Section 13-80-127 did not violate due process, as it was rationally related to a permissible state objective. Because more than 10 years had elapsed after substantial completion of the building before the lawsuit was filed, the architects were immune from suit according to &sect; 13-80-127.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the architects.</SPAN></P>

The citizens contended that the display, as part of the Christmas decorations, violated Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 4. The trial court granted the city's motion to dismiss, finding that the citizens failed to establish a prima facie case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Certain citizens filed suit against the city seeking a declaratory judgment that the city's nativity display violated Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 4, seeking injunctive relief prohibiting inclusion of the creche among the holiday decorations on the steps of the city building, and seeking an order that the nativity scene be sold at public auction. The court reversed the dismissal and remanded the action. The court found that the prudential considerations of standing were met because the injury allegedly suffered was to a legally protected interest, because art. II, &sect; 4 specifically forbade that any individual be required to support a particular religion and prohibited the governmental preference of any religion. The court held that, after giving appropriate scope to the citizens' evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor, as Colo. R. Civ. P. 50(a) required, the evidence was adequate to establish that the creche represented Christianity and that it had an inherent religious significance that was not lost by inclusion among other display elements representing the secular side of the Christmas holiday.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the challenged factual findings were not clearly erroneous and were supported by substantial evidence. The court concluded that the board's determination that the dentist's actions constituted negligent malpractice had a reasonable basis in law, but that the board's ultimate finding of gross incompetence lacked a reasonable basis in law.

The court concluded that the ordinance was validly passed as an emergency measure, noting that substantial evidence as to an emergency's existence was presented at the hearing at which the ordinance was passed, and emergency measures were constitutionally excepted from the power of referendum. The court further opined that the ordinance was not subject to Colo. Const. art. II, &sect; 30 because the ordinance was adopted before the amendment's effective date. The court also found that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 31-12-118 (1977) did not bar the city council from commencing the annexation proceedings after the landowners filed petitions for an annexation election because the petitions defectively divided the city's land without its permission.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father's 12 children were adjudicated neglected and removed from his custody. The father did not appeal.

The parents fled to New Mexico and the Colorado authorities tried unsuccessfully to extradite them. A resubmitted extradition warrant that was legally sufficient was issued, but the parents had moved back to California. The father was arrested in California and returned to Colorado to face the charges. The lower court denied his motion to dismiss on the basis of collateral estoppel and the alleged unconstitutionality of the juvenile court order awarding custody to the Denver Department of Social Services. The court affirmed. The father's prior discharge on a writ of habeas corpus in the New Mexico proceeding did not bar subsequent prosecution in Colorado because it dealt with the issues of the technical sufficiency of the extradition papers, not the merits of the crime charged, therefore it did not collaterally estop Colorado from prosecuting the father on the merits of the violation of custody charges.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant challenged his conviction for aggravated robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction of aggravated robbery, claiming that the statute therefor, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-4-302 (1978 Repl. Vol. 8), violated equal protection because it imposed the same penalty regardless of whether the offense was committed with specific intent or knowingly. He also claimed that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-803 (1978 Repl. Vol. 8) violated equal protection in restricting the use of the defense of impaired mental condition to specific intent crimes, and that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offenses of attempted aggravated robbery, and simple robbery. The court affirmed the judgment, declaring that, because both forms of aggravated robbery had identical penalties, they did not violate equal protection. In so ruling, the court noted the legislature's prerogative to determine the offense's elements and its punishment. Because defendant had presented no evidence on impaired mental condition, the court found his attack on &sect; 18-1-803 to be meritless; it also found no error in the refusal to instruct on the jury on the lesser-included offenses because there was insufficient evidence to support either instruction.</SPAN></P>

The driver sought judicial review and obtained a stay of the revocation. More than three years after the initial pleadings were filed, the district court dismissed the case on the district attorney's motion. The driver filed a motion in the district court seeking vacation, which motion was granted. The district court affirmed the revocation. On appeal, the court affirmed. There was no effort on the driver's part to bring the case to resolution on the merits until after it was dismissed for want of prosecution, and there was thus no inequity in delayed implementation of the revocation. It was not error to refuse to admit the officer's notes into evidence when the driver's counsel was given full opportunity to review the officer's notes. The driver presented no evidence on the probative value of the test, and the implied consent law placed no time limit on the administration of the test.

Defendant contended that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 18-1-105(6) (1973) (1981 Supp.), which permitted sentencing outside the presumptive range, was unconstitutionally vague because no standards were established.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with first-degree sexual assault. At about the same time, he was charged with a similar offense in another county. Defendant entered a plea to the first-degree sexual assault charge in return for the similar charge being dismissed. After considering a presentence report, which showed a prior rape conviction, the trial court imposed a sentence that exceeded the presumptive range. Defendant argued that &sect; 18-1-105(6) was unconstitutionally vague and thus deprived him of due process and equal protection because no standards were set out in the statute to guide the trial court. Section 105(6) permitted the court to impose a sentence outside the presumptive range if it concluded that extraordinary mitigating or aggravating circumstances were present. The court held that &sect; 18-1-105(6) was not unconstitutionally vague because the legislature was not required to define the readily comprehensible and everyday terms it used in the statute. The court concluded that the words &quot;extraordinary mitigating or aggravating circumstances&quot; were words that were capable of being applied by a judge in a fair and reasoned manner in exercising his discretion in imposing a sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the beginning of the jury trial, the trial court reconsidered its earlier probable cause ruling and dismissed a charge against defendant of first-degree assault on the ground that there was insufficient evidence adduced at the preliminary hearing to support the charge. After a mistrial, the people filed a petition seeking reinstatement of the charges of attempted murder in the second degree and first-degree assault. The people invoked the original jurisdiction of the court on the ground that if they were forced to proceed to trial on the remaining two counts jeopardy would attach, and they would be foreclosed from proceeding on the charges which were dismissed by the trial court. The court held that the wording of Colo. R. Crim. P. 5(a)(4)(III) precluded any review of the county court's finding of probable cause. Because probable cause was established as to both factors, the district court erred in dismissing the attempted second-degree murder charge. The cause was remanded to the district court for reinstatement of the attempted second-degree murder and the first-degree assault charges, as well as a hearing on the testimonial competence of a hypnotized witness.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was first convicted of theft by receiving while engaging in the business of buying, selling, or otherwise disposing of stolen goods for profit. Defendant's motion to dismiss trial on the two remaining charges was denied, and he was convicted. Defendant appealed on the grounds that the second trial violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the U.S. Const. amend. V. The court agreed and reversed the conviction. The court found that the statutory offense with which defendant was charged was a hybrid crime that involved a primary act of theft by receiving and a &quot;fencing&quot; element. The court found that the second prosecution was predicated upon the same acts of theft by receiving upon which the State relied to obtain a conviction under the &quot;fencing&quot; element of the first conviction and held that the successive prosecution could not reconciled with the &quot;same offense&quot; prohibition of either the Double Jeopardy Clause or Colo.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The miners argued that the board's denial of a special use permit stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of Congress in enacting the Mining Law of 1872 and thus was impermissible. The board asserted, inter alia, that the miners were merely explorers on federally contested claims and that its action did not frustrate any rights of the miners under the federal mining laws. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for entry of judgment in accordance with the views expressed in the court's opinion. The court observed that the underlying purpose of the federal mining laws was to encourage exploration for and development of mineral resources on public lands. The court reasoned that the board sought not merely to supplement the federal scheme, but to prohibit the very activities contemplated and authorized by federal law, and that such a veto power was not consistent with the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. The court concluded that if the miners' activities could be characterized as &quot;exploration,&quot; those activities fell within the express scope of the federal statutes, particularly 30 U.S.C.S. &sect; 22.</SPAN></P>

The court did not see how the failure of the ordinance to require an intent to injure raised a problem of unconstitutional vagueness. It went without saying that the decision to include or exclude a particular element in defining unlawful conduct was, in the first instance, a matter of legislative prerogative. While separate definitions of the culpability terms of an ordinance might be the preferable legislative option, the omission of such definitions under the circumstances of this case was not a deficiency of constitutional dimension.

Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-2-123(1)(a) (1981) based on his accumulation of 12 points within a one-year period. The driver argued &sect; 42-2-123(1)(a) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Within a one-year period, the driver accumulated 12 points after he committed several four-point traffic violations, which included speeding, careless driving, and failure to observe a stop sign. After hearing, the Department suspended the driver's license. The driver argued that &sect; 42-2-123(1)(a) violated Equal Protection because it permitted persons holding a chauffeur's licenses to accumulate four more points than regular operators within the same one-year period prior to suspension. On appeal, the court rejected the driver's claim that the different treatment of chauffeurs under &sect; 42-2-123(1)(a) lacked sufficient rationality to further the State's goals. The court ruled that the classification of chauffeurs was reasonably related to the State's legitimate interest in highway safety. The court noted that under &sect; 42-2-123(1)(a), chauffeurs were not granted unlimited immunity from license suspension and that their ability to accumulate four more points prior to license suspension applied only when all points were accumulated in the course of employment. The court concluded that the driver did not sustain his burden of proving that &sect; 42-2-123(1)(a) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court, Tenth Judicial District (Colorado) found defendant not guilty of first-degree murder by reason of insanity and automatically committed defendant to the Department of Institutions as required by Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16-8-105(4) (1978). Defendant sought review of the trial court's judgment of commitment and also sought review of the trial court's order denying his motion to dismiss the murder charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his automatic commitment, claiming that &sect; 16-8-105(4) was invalid because it deprived him of his right to due process and equal protection of the laws. The court ruled that the automatic commitment statute did not violate the due process rights of one found not guilty by reason of insanity and that equal protection was not violated by the fact that a defendant was denied the same precommitment hearing or release standards as provided to those civilly committed. The court further ruled &sect; 16-8-105(4) was not infirm on the ground that those who successfully raised the affirmative defense of insanity were automatically committed while those who successfully raised other affirmative defenses were discharged. The court noted that there was no equal protection violation because the different treatment was reasonably related to legitimate state interests. The court further ruled that defendant waived his right to a speedy trial because the trial date was set at the request of defendant's attorney to accommodate his schedule and that the trial court therefore did not err in denying defendant's motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that: (1) the group had no continuing membership or congregation; (2) because it ministered to the religious needs of a single age group, the group did not foster the kind of continuity and continuing loyalty that other church organizations maintained; (3) the incidental burden on the group, a contribution to the unemployment insurance fund, was minimal; (4) the primary purpose of the group's activities was to direct and encourage young people toward involvement in traditional church congregations, which existed independently of the group; and (5) the group was not a separate &quot;religious denomination&quot; within the meaning of Colo.

The court affirmed the judgment finding that the in-court identification of defendant by the deceased witness was not tainted by the photographic identification and the admission of the testimony was proper. Although it was error to admit the photographic identification into evidence because the method of conducting the identification tended to interject unnecessary risks of misidentification due to the suggestive circumstances, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Defendant was not denied his constitutional right to confrontation under the U.S. Const. amend. VI and Colo. Const. art.

On appeal, the Supreme Court of Colorado, having jurisdiction over the appeal under Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 13-4-102(1)(b) because of the constitutional issues presented, concluded that the trial court was correct in ruling that the regulation prohibiting activities &quot;unduly designed to increase the consumption of alcoholic beverages&quot; was unconstitutionally vague. However, the trial court erred in striking down the rule prescribing standards for minimum employee attire and prohibiting certain sexually-oriented entertainment and conduct on liquor-licensed premises. Therefore, the appellate court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed it in part, specifically holding that regulations were not void simply because they were not accompanied by a fiscal impact statement satisfying the requirements of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24-4-103(8)(d) (1978 Repl. and 1981 Supp.).</SPAN></P>

The Secretary issued a memorandum which directed that, as required by Colo. Rev.

The trial court held that the failure of the Colorado Workmen's Compensation Act (Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8-40-101 et seq.

(statute), which imposed holding period and recording requirements on businesses dealing in valuable articles. The lower court determined that the merchants did not establish the statute's unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. The court affirmed the lower court's order because the order did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Specifically, the merchants were required to make a clear showing that injunctive relief was necessary to protect their property or fundamental constitutional rights. Moreover, a strong presumption of constitutionality applied to the statute. The merchants did not demonstrate a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits as to that issue, which was a condition to injunctive relief. The lower court utilized the proper legal standard and burden of proof, despite the merchants' contrary assertions. Based on the foregoing, the merchants were not entitled to injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

The district court granted summary judgment against the association on its claims. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Colorado affirmed that part of the judgment holding the statute was constitutional on its face.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-22-319(5) (1978) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-22-126(1)(e) (1978) operated unconstitutionally by classifying &quot;substantially similar&quot; drugs in different categories. Thus, Quaalude (Methaqualone) was classified as a dangerous drug subjecting defendant to a misdemeanor conviction. While percodan (oxycodone) was a narcotic subjecting defendant to a felony conviction. Defendant claimed both drugs were included in Schedule II of the federal Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 811-812. He also argued that legislating different penalties for &quot;substantially similar&quot; drugs violated equal protection. The district attorney appealed the trial court's ruling. Reversing and remanding, the court held that &sect; 12-22-319(5) and Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 12-22-126(1)(e) (1978) proscribed different conduct.  Colo. Rev.

An electric utility opposed the proposed development.

The city filed a motion to dismiss the complaint stating that the city council was an indispensable party. The lower court granted the motion as to some of the claims and held in favor of the city on the other claims. In affirming the decision, the court held that (1) the council was a necessary party, the city was not its alter ego, and the complaint could not be amended to allow joinder and thus claims cognizable under Colo.

Stat. &sect; 16-10-201 (1978), which related to impeachment of a witness, was unconstitutional as ex post facto legislation. The trial court dismissed the claim for post-conviction relief. Affirming, the court agreed with the trial court that post-conviction relief was not warranted because the issues raised were available for review when the case was reviewed on the appeal. The court's review would have been nothing more that a second appeal addressing the same issues on some recently contrived constitutional theory. The court also agreed with the trial court's conclusion that there was no ex post facto infirmity in the statute because it did not enlarge the punishment to which defendant was liable when his crime was committed, make any act involved in his offense criminal that was not criminal at the time he committed the murder of which he was found guilty, or change the quality or degree of his offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on complicity because there was no such evidence. According to defendant's tape-recorded statement, the companion began beating her 2 year-old the daughter about two weeks earlier. Later the child fell while being punished by the companion. The child apparently hit her head, eventually collapsed, and her heart stopped. The child was revived but was not taken to the hospital until the next day. The child suffered severe brain and central nervous system injuries and later died. The court disagreed that a complicity instruction was inconsistent with the crime of child abuse. Child abuse could be committed either by causing or permitting a child to be placed in a dangerous situation or to be cruelly punished. In addition, at the time of the crime, child abuse could be sustained on the basis of an intentional or knowing mens rea as well as on a negligent mens rea. The evidence supported the inference that defendant knew her companion was beating her child and did nothing to stop him. The jury could have found that she had the specific intent required for complicity in permitting him to abuse the child.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee school children (children) sought a ruling that Public School Finance Act of 1973 (PFSA), Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 22-50-101, et seq., the school finance system, was unconstitutional. The District Court of the City and County of Denver (Colorado) ruled in favor of the children. Appellant State Board of Education (board) sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the PFSA, high-wealth school districts were able to generate greater revenue for their districts than low-wealth districts. The children claimed, inter alia, that the PFSA violated the equal protection clause by interfering with their fundamental right to education and by creating a &quot;suspect classification&quot; based on wealth. They claimed that the PFSA was subject to strict judicial scrutiny. The court first held that the right to a free public education was not a fundamental right under either the United States or the Colorado Constitutions. The Colorado constitution also did not mandate absolute equality in educational services or expenditures. The court held that the children did not establish that, as low-income people, they were a distinct and insular suspect class. The equal protection clause, by its terms, applied to individuals and not a political body. Although linked by their respective income levels, the children had no common attribute relative to the school financing system. The court further found that wealth alone was not a suspect classification and that, as there was no fundamental right involved, the PFSA was not subject to strict scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed his conviction. The district attorney only omitted references to the victim's pregnancy, which was not a result of the assault. Her later pregnancy had no bearing on the acts charged or on defendant's defense, in which he denied committing the offenses, and under the rape shield statute,&nbsp;Col. Rev. Stat. &sect;18-3-407 (1978 Repl. Vol. 8), could not have been used for impeachment. The investigating officer's testimony that his impression was that the victim's report was truthful was intended to rehabilitate her credibility after the defense sought to impeach it, and it was not impermissible bolstering. The habitual offender statute was constitutional. The opportunity to consider mitigating factors was only constitutionally mandated where the death penalty was involved. It did not violate the separation of powers because prosecutors have uniquely broad discretion in charging offenders and the statute did not exceed the permissible delegated legislative power.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the fraud conviction, finding that the trial court's failure to define the term &quot;knowing&quot; for the jury was not plain error because it had clearly defined specific intent to defraud. The court reversed defendant's adjudication and sentence as a habitual criminal because the state bore the burden of proving defendant's prior convictions, and the trial court had no legal basis to adjudicate defendant a habitual criminal based on his trial testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review from a judgment of the District Court of Adams County (Colorado), which convicted him of extreme indifference murder, felony murder, second-degree sexual assault, and child abuse, based upon the violent death of a 23-month old infant. The jury had rejected defendant's insanity defense. Defendant contended that there were numerous errors in his sanity trial as well as in the trial on the issue of guilt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of extreme indifference murder, felony murder, second-degree sexual assault, and child abuse, all arising out of the death of a 23-month-old victim. The jury had determined that defendant was sane at the time of the incident. Defendant appealed, contending that there were numerous errors in the guilt and sanity phases of his trial. The court affirmed the finding of sanity, holding that a res gestae statement was proper as nonhearsay and police statements were properly admitted as cumulative evidence, that photographs caused no prejudicial error, and that instructions were proper. The denial of a new sanity hearing was also proper where the prior hearing had been extensive. The court reversed the conviction on extreme indifference murder because the statute was unconstitutional. The court reversed all other convictions as well, holding that statements made by defendant to a psychiatrist in the course of a sanity examination could not be received at the guilt trial. The court held that review of both police searches was required on the issue of consent. Further, that defendant's Miranda rights were violated when he indicated that he wanted to stop talking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the finding of defendant's sanity but reversed all of the convictions. The court held that the extreme indifference murder statute was unconstitutional and required reversal. Further, that it was prejudicial error to permit admission of psychiatric testimony about certain incriminating statements made by defendant during the guilt phase, where they were meant only for the sanity issue.</SPAN></P>

The only evidence connecting the defendant to the crime was a footprint under the victim's window. On the defendant's appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the defendant was not denied equal protection by the marital exception to the sexual assault statute contained in Colo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted in separate district courts of various crimes, including burglary, assault, and aggravated robbery, and were sentenced as habitual criminals. The court of appeals concluded that the legislative purpose of Colo. Rev.

On further appeal, the court affirmed because the clear language of the statute supported the court of appeals' resolution of defendants' cases. The court concluded that the court of appeals correctly rejected defendants' arguments that they were improperly convicted under &sect; 16-13-101. The trial court's finding that the second defendant's confessions were not induced by a promise was supported by the record and foreclosed reversal by the court. The admissibility of an in-court identification by a waitress was not plain error, entitling the third defendant to raise it for the first time on review.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was charged with violating the home rule city's speeding ordinance.

Const. art. XX, &sect; 6. The district court reversed the judgment of dismissal but held that the ordinance and civil system of adjudication was unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that &sect; 11.1.01(B) violated the counterpart provision of Colo. Const. art. XX, &sect; 6 because there was a statutory counterpart to the city's speeding ordinance, Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 42-4-1001(7)(b) and (i) (1981), which proscribed speeding as a criminal offense. The violation of an ordinance that was the counterpart of a criminal statute was triable and punishable under the protections applicable to criminal cases even though prosecuted in municipal court. Because arrest and detention were authorized under the statutory scheme for misdemeanor traffic offenses, there was no legislative intent to decriminalize minor traffic violations by denominating them &quot;misdemeanor traffic offenses&quot; and proscribing a fine-only scheme.</SPAN></P>

An undercover officer posed as a customer responding to a newspaper ad.

Further, the evidence was sufficient to support a conclusion by a reasonable person that defendant was guilty of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. Finally, it was not error to instruct the jury on complicity because, under Colo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At trial, the probate court found that at the time an antenuptial agreement was executed, the wife was not represented by independent counsel; the decedent's attorney, who drafted the agreement, did not advise the wife of her marital rights as a spouse under Colorado law; and there was no evidence that either party had made disclosure to the other of assets prior to the signing of the agreement or had actual knowledge of the nature and extent of the assets of the other. The probate court concluded that the evidence failed by any standard to establish fraud, concealment, material misrepresentation, or undue influence at the time the antenuptial contract was entered into. Further, the court found that the appellant, having the burden of proof to establish lack of knowledgeable waiver after fair disclosure failed to meet that burden and denied her request to set aside the agreement. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Colorado acknowledged the seeming unfairness of placing the burden on the wife of proving lack of disclosure while barring her testimony because of the dead man's statute,&nbsp;Colo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The buyer purchased a number of first mortgage home loans. The sales agreement contained a warranty that the mortgages comply with applicable state and federal law in all respects.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 5-3-202, 5-3 209. The buyer acknowledged that Senate Bill 20 exempted those mortgages from coverage under UCCC, however it maintained that the bill was void because it was outside of the scope of the governor's call to the general assembly. The sole issue raised on appeal was whether Senate Bill 20 was unconstitutional because it was not encompassed by the governor's call to the legislature as was required by Colo. Const. Art. V, &sect; 7. The court held that Senate Bill 20 was properly enacted under Item 5 and Item 40 of the governor's call to the general assembly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed an order of the Eagle County District Court (Colorado) dismissing the county court convictions of two defendants for kayaking on closed waters in violation of Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-31-114 (1973), on the grounds that the statute could not serve as a constitutional basis for criminal prosecution of the defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">For safety reasons, after two deaths, the sheriff closed a river to anyone using tubes, rafts, or kayaks. The sheriff's order was based on Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-31-114 (1973). Two kayakers were later observed on the closed waters. They were issued a summons and complaint for violating Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-6-127(2) (1973). The next day, the deputy re-issued the summonses for kayaking on closed waters. Both were convicted of violating &sect; 33-31-114 and fined. On appeal, the district court reversed and dismissed. The court affirmed. Colo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 33-31-114 gave enforcement officials the authority to close a river to boating when the condition of the water constituted a hazard to human life and safety but it could not be applied constitutionally to convict defendants because it had no express provision making it unlawful to disobey an order closing a body of water. As the General Assembly did not choose to apply criminal sanctions to one who failed to obey a sheriff's order prohibiting boating, defendants were not subject to criminal charges for their kayaking.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reversal of defendants' county court conviction for kayaking on closed waters and dismissal of the state's charges against them was affirmed, as the legislature had not chosen to criminalize violations of a sheriff's order prohibiting boating or closing waters for safety reasons. The statute authorizing sheriffs to issue such orders could not alone be used to impose criminal sanctions.</SPAN></P>
