</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of an order from the Public Service Commission (Florida), which ordered petitioner and respondent to adopt a territorial agreement concerning the settlement area in question and ordered petitioner to refrain from offering electric service to the settlement area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent provided electricity to a settlement. Petitioner agreed to provide water and sewer service to the settlement. Petitioner had a policy of requiring its water customers to also utilize its electric service. The commission ordered respondent and petitioner to develop a territorial agreement relative to the settlement area and ordered petitioner to refrain from offering electric service or constructing duplicate facilities in the settlement area. The court affirmed the commission's order. Respondent's letter of complaint with the commission was sufficient to invoke the commission's jurisdiction to determine the matter in dispute. Fla. Stat. ch. 366.04(2)(d), (e) were not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. Those sections were limited in scope in providing for jurisdiction of the commission over rural electric cooperatives for the approval of territorial agreements and resolution of territorial disputes. The commission's findings that either utility could properly serve the area, but that a territorial agreement was the best solution in order to avoid costly competition and wasteful duplication, were supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner's application for a writ of certiorari of the commission's decision prohibiting duplication of respondent's electric services to a settlement community, finding the commission's findings that a territorial agreement was the best solution for the parties in order to prevent costly competition and wasteful duplication were supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed motion for clarification and motion to appear as amicus curiae, both motions concerning the court's decision to affirm a ruling of the Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit for Leon County (Florida), which held that Fla. Stat. ch. 658.10(1) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had the authority to examine the stock books of banks. Plaintiffs had a duty to prepare and furnish to defendant accurate lists of all their stockholders and the number of shares owned by each. Defendant contended Fla. Stat. ch. 658.10(1) authorized him to release such information to the public for inspection or to the news media. The court affirmed the decision that the statute was unconstitutional. The statute gave defendant the right to release the stock holdings information to the public once defendant had demanded and received the information from plaintiffs. The information was usually confidential but allowed defendant to exempt certain records from confidentiality on a whim. Defendant was given the power day to day to say what the law was as to the confidential nature of bank records. The constitution did not permit such a delegation of power. The statute was couched in vague terms and was so broad in scope that it had to be held unconstitutional as attempting to grant defendant the power to say what the law was.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a trial court's judgment which directly held invalid Fla. Stat. ch. 921.231. This statutory provision mandated a presentence investigation report for all felony defendants. Appellant had argued that the statute required the trial court to order a presentence report in his felony case but the trial court refused. The trial court held that the statute was not binding upon him and that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.710, which made the report discretionary, was controlling. The court agreed. First, the means to assure the informed exercise of judicial discretion in sentencing was a procedural matter properly determined by court rules. Second, to the extent that the statute attempted to make the presentence investigation report mandatory in all felony cases, the statute unconstitutionally invaded the rule making province of the court. Finally, the trial judge's refusal to order a presentence investigation report did not prejudice appellant because he had sufficient knowledge of appellant's personal history including a record of eight prior criminal felony convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's auto theft conviction under Fla. Stat. ch. 814.03(1) (1973) was affirmed because a jury instruction regarding a statutory presumption of intent did not violate due process. Defendant rented an automobile. Defendant was charged with auto theft. At trial, defendant brought a motion for judgment of acquittal. The trial court denied the motion. Defendant appealed. Defendant claimed a jury instruction based on a statutory presumption of intent under Fla. Stat. ch. 814.06(5) (1973) violated due process. Defendant claimed the statutory presumption failed to pass the reasonable doubt test required in criminal cases. The reviewing court affirmed, holding where defendant kept the car for more than five months, sufficient evidence existed upon which the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to keep the car. The statutory presumption did not preclude evidence in rebuttal, nor did it raise an independent legal presumption as to the ultimate fact in issue. Therefore, the presumption complied with the requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal and affirmed his auto theft conviction and sentence. Because a statutory presumption providing intent did not raise an independent legal presumption as to the ultimate fact in issue, and because there was sufficient evidence to find defendant intended to keep the car, the presumption comported with due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree, robbery, assault with intent to commit murder, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony. Defendant and his accomplice forced two grocery store employees to lie down on their stomachs in the bottle storage room and then fired at them. A total of $ 35 was taken. The three elements of the corpus delicti in homicide cases are: (1) the fact of death; (2) the criminal agency of another person; and (3) the identity of the deceased. The supreme court held that plaintiff clearly satisfied the criteria and proved the existence of the corpus delicti beyond all reasonable doubt. Finally, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances that surrounded defendant's commission of what the court said was a truly senseless crime convinced the court that the death penalty was justified.</SPAN></P>

Appellee refused, sought declaratory relief, and the circuit court held the statute unconstitutional. Appellant, the executive director of the department, sought review. The court reversed on the issue of constitutionality, but affirmed the decision in all other respects. The court held that the standards attempted to be applied to appellee were &quot;rules&quot; under the act and as such were not enforceable against him in the absence of publication in the manner prescribed by law. The area supervisor had attempted to apply the statute to appellee in an arbitrary and totally discretionary manner. For that reason the attempted application of the statute was invalid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was accused of a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 847.05 (1975), which provided that any person who publicly used or uttered any indecent or obscene language would be guilty of a misdemeanor. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss challenging the constitutionality of &sect; 847.05. The trial court denied appellant's motion and adjudicated appellant guilty. Appellant sought review. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court concluded that &sect; 847.05 was unconstitutional on its face, because it was overbroad. The court held that a statute must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part would render them liable. The court held that special rules of decision applied in cases where a statute made speech punishable as a crime. The court held that when a statute punished only spoken words, it could withstand attack upon its facial constitutionality only if it was not susceptible of application to speech, although vulgar or offensive, that was protected by U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV. The court held that &sect; 847.05 was susceptible of application to protected speech and was, therefore, overbroad and facially invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a complaint on an account stated against defendant. Attached to the complaint was a copy of a statement supported by invoices which showed a debt owed to plaintiff by defendant. A writ of attachment was issued ordering the seizure of so much of the property of defendant as would satisfy a judgment. A directed verdict was entered by the trial court in favor of the plaintiff. A decision upholding Fla. Stat. ch. 76 as constitutional was reversed and remanded and plaintiff's attachment was dissolved. Due process required an early hearing, which should have been an immediate post-seizure hearing, at which defendant had an opportunity to be heard and at which plaintiff would have been required to prove at least probable cause. The statute did not require that a judge issue the writ. A supporting affidavit was not required and a writ could have been issued on a conclusory allegation by plaintiff that he believed in the existence of one of the grounds for attachment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Florida legislature enacted Item 853, 1976 Fla.

Shortly after the passage of Item 853, the legislature informed the governor that Item 853 had been included in the act by mistake. The governor vetoed Item 853, but was uncertain of the constitutionality of his veto. Petitioners, the state Division of Bond Finance, the governor, and other state departments and officials, brought an original proceeding in mandamus, seeking the court to command the secretary of state to expunge Item 853 or, in the alternative, to determine that the governor's veto was effective.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee electors brought a petition for writ of mandamus against appellant county board of commissioners, seeking an order requiring appellant to reapportion in an even-numbered year so that the county commissioners' districts would be as nearly equal in proportion to population as possible.

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment, discharged the peremptory writ, and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to enter judgment for appellant. Appellees' argument that the existing apportionment plan violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV was without merit because the county commissioners ran at large in the county and, thus, represented the entire county. Appellees failed to show that the existing apportionment plan violated Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(e) because the plan did not operate to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population. Appellees did not show invidious discrimination. It was not unreasonable for the state to require redistricting only every two years.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land development corporation sued appellees, tax assessor and director of tax assessments, in an action for relief from tax assessments. The trial court dismissed appellant's complaint for failure to state a cause of action in an amended complaint seeking ad valorem real property tax relief and from earlier orders relating to discovery. Appellant claimed appellees failed to apply the Rose law, Fla. Stat. ch. 195.062 (1973). The trial court found the Rose law, ch. 195.062, unconstitutional. The supreme court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the count of appellant's complaint referring to the Rose law because the case law that found the statute unconstitutional was held to be applied prospectively. Past transactions in justified reliance on the law would not be disturbed if the result would be an unreasonable hardship on a party acting in good faith. No such justified reliance existed in the instant case. The court reversed the trial court's denial of depositions, and ordered the trial court to re-examine each of appellant's interrogatories, disallowing deposition only where good cause was shown.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 959.115, a statute that allowed juveniles tried as adults to be sentenced as minors assigned to juvenile facilities for rehabilitation, or as adults and assigned to adult prisons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged with two counts of robbery and tried as an adult while a 16 year old minor. Appellant pleaded nolo contendere to one count of robbery. The trial court sentenced appellant initially to a juvenile facility where rehabilitation efforts could be undertaken in a less restrictive environment until appellant was 21 years of age. Appellant was not rehabilitated. He had escaped from the juvenile facility twice and was arrested for auto theft before being returned to the juvenile facility. After the juvenile division certified that appellant was not amenable to rehabilitation, it revoked his status as a delinquent and the trial judge sentenced appellant to the state prison minus time served in the juvenile facility. Fla. Stat. ch. 959.115 allowed a juvenile offender, who was properly certified to be tried as an adult without a prior juvenile adjudicatory hearing, to be sentenced either as an adult or as a juvenile. The court affirmed the trial court order sending appellant to adult prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court order imposing an increased sentence to be executed in the adult prison by appellant because Florida law allowed the trial court to sentence a minor tried as an adult, such as the appellant, to a less restrictive rehabilitative program akin to probation, revoke a rehabilitative sentence, and sentence the offender to an adult prison if there was no rehabilitation and no prior adjudicatory juvenile hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Florida Real Estate Commission, sought an injunction against appellee company and its mortgage representatives, alleging that they violated the Florida Real Estate License Law, Fla.

The trial court found that appellee company was unable to hire licensed brokers to sell its property because of the peculiar job requirements involved, and concluded that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to appellees because it imposed a burdensome and discriminatory classification with no countervailing public benefit and without any reasonable relationship to the public welfare. On appeal, the court affirmed. After examining the statutory exceptions, the court determined that the exception in the case of corporations did not constitute a reasonable classification when applied to appellees. Therefore, the court concluded that the application of the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 475 to the activities of the particular appellees, violated the provisions of Fla. Const. Art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the judgment from the Circuit Court in and for Escambia County (Florida) that held that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 877.04, as amended by 1969 Fla. Laws ch. 69-118, was unconstitutional as applied to appellee, a tattoo artist, because the statute forbade anyone except a doctor, a dentist, or someone under their direction, from tattooing another person, thus depriving appellee of her right to practice her profession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a licensed tattoo artist, operated a tattoo business for over 25 years when Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 877.04 was amended by 1969 Fla. Laws ch. 69-118, which made it unlawful for anyone other than a doctor, a dentist, or anyone under their direction to tattoo someone, thus depriving appellee of her right to practice her profession. Appellee filed an action for an order allowing her to continue tattooing, and the trial court found that &sect; 877.04 as amended was unconstitutional as applied to appellee. On appeal, the court held that the state had an inherent police power to regulate any profession to promote the public health, safety, and welfare, and that appellee's right to contract or practice her profession was subject to the state's police power. Because tattooing was done by making numerous needle punctures into the skin and putting ink into the puncture holes, it was a reasonable exercise of the state's police power to require that tattooing be done by a doctor or dentist, and the statute was not vague. Therefore, the court found &sect; 877.04 as amended to be constitutional, reversed the judgment, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an interlocutory order entered by the Circuit Court in and for Duval County (Florida) that declared the minimum damage award provision of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court rejected appellee's free speech attack of Fla. Stat. ch. 559.72(4), but declared the minimum damage award provision of Fla. Stat. ch. 559.77(1) to be unconstitutional on due process grounds. Appellant sought review of the trial court's decision regarding the constitutionality of &sect; 559.77(1). Appellee filed a cross-appeal on its unsuccessful free speech challenge to &sect; 559.72(4). The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the trial court properly applied the commercial speech doctrine to the facts of the case and properly rejected appellee's constitutional challenge to &sect; 559.72(4). The court held that the minimum damage provision of &sect; 559.77(1) was not unconstitutional as a denial of due process of law. The court held that the minimum award afforded by the statute exhibited both liquidated and punitive damages. The court held that it was the intent of the legislature to provide a remedy for a class of injury where damages were difficult to prove and at the same time provide a penalty against parties such as appellee. The court held that neither objective was without the purview of proper legislative action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the minimum damage award provision was not unconstitutional because it provided liquidated damages in an area of the law in which ascertainment of the dollar amount of actual damages would be difficult. The court held that the trial court properly applied the commercial speech doctrine and found no constitutional limitation on free speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife sought certiorari review of the decision of the First District Court of Appeal (Florida) which declared part of Fla. Stat. ch. 689.11(1), (2) to be unconstitutional and found that the deed executed by appellee husband, purporting to convey the family home to appellant, was ineffective.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife and appellee husband were involved in a marital dispute, and appellee husband executed a deed which conveyed their home to appellant wife. The deed was witnessed by one individual, but appellant wife never joined in the conveyance. Appellant wife contended that the deed effectively transferred the family home to her. Appellee husband claimed that he had given appellant the deed to appease her during their dispute, but that he assumed it had been destroyed since they had reconciled after the deed was executed. The trial court held that the deed was ineffective. Appellant sought review, contending that Fla. Stat. ch. 689.11(1), (2) made the deed effective. The appeals court concluded that the statute was unconstitutional and affirmed the finding that the deed was not effective. Appellant again sought review. The supreme court vacated the appellate court's finding that the law was unconstitutional, but affirmed the finding that the deed was not effective because the deed was signed by only one witness, while Fla. Stat. ch. 689.01 required a deed to have more than one witness, and because appellee did not intent to actually convey the property to appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit of Volusia County (Florida) certified the question of whether the legislature intended for Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 561.20(2)(a)(3) to apply prospectively or to all special restaurant licenses even if issued prior to the effective date of the statute. The case arose when petitioner restaurant licensees challenged the application of &sect; 561.20(2)(a)(3) to their existing licenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The licensees held restaurant licenses prior to the enactment of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 561.20(2)(a)(3), which provided a prohibition on the issuance of special licenses to any restaurant deriving at least 51 percent of their gross revenues from the sale of food and nonalcoholic beverages. The circuit court certified the question of whether the legislature intended for the statute to apply prospectively or to all special restaurant licenses even if issued prior to the effective date of the statute. Application of the statute to all licenses would have affected the licensees' status, but prospective application would not have involved their licenses. The court found that the legislature intended the statute to apply prospectively and that it did not apply to petitioners' licenses because the statute used the term &quot;henceforth&quot; and accordingly referred to the issuance of future licenses.</SPAN></P>

The court found that because there was no right to a trial by jury for appellee's traffic violation at the time of the adoption of the first Constitution of Florida, the statutory denial of a jury trial was not prohibited by Fla.

Stat. ch. 733.302, because he was not a citizen of the United States. Petitioner contended the statute was an unconstitutional violated of his right to equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was a resident of Dade County, but he was not a citizen of the United States. Petitioner's wife died intestate, and he requested letters of administration from the county circuit court. His request was denied because he was not a citizen of the United States, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 733.302, and the court held that the citizenship requirement of the statute was constitutional. Petitioner appealed. The supreme court held that ch. 733.302 was unconstitutional because its requirement that an applicant for letters of administration had to be a citizen of the United States constituted a violation of the equal protection clauses of the U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 and the Fla. Const. This was because the requirement that an administrator be a United States citizen had no bearing on the person's ability to perform the duties of an administrator, and there was no substantial or real difference between resident aliens and resident citizens that related to any valid legislative purpose underlying the statute. Moreover, the federal constitution did not permit discrimination against aliens by federal agencies acting without explicit authorization of the Congress and the President.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state and board of trustees challenged the decision of the Circuit Court, Highlands County (Florida), ruling that the boundary line between appellee riparian owner's upland property and the sovereignty bottom lands was the present ordinary highwater mark of the lake and adjudging Fla. Stat. ch. 253.151 to be unconstitutional both on its face and as applied by appellants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was a riparian owner of lands bordering a navigable lake. The ordinary high-water mark of the lake was meandered at different points and different times by surveyors. Appellee acquired title from appellant board of trustees and state government for the purpose of developing the land for resale as a residential lakeshore community. A dispute arose between appellants and appellee as to the location of the boundary line between appellants' bottom lands of the lake and appellee's upland property. Appellants maintained that pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 253.151, the boundary line should be located at a contour above mean sea level, laying claim to approximately half of appellee's purchased property. The lower court ruled that the boundary line between appellee's upland property and appellant's bottom lands was the present ordinary highwater mark of the lake and adjudged the statute to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding the boundary to have been correctly applied. Fla. Stat. ch. 253.151 was unconstitutional because it would have allowed a taking of appellee's riparian water rights without just compensation, in violation of due process of law.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 893.05(1), which allowed a medical practitioner to prescribe controlled substances, was unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, and uncertain, as a result of not clearly and definitely defining the term &quot;in good faith&quot; so that a person could determine in advance whether a contemplated act was within or without the law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a licensed physician, was charged by information with 17 counts of violating Fla. Stat.

Each count alleged a different occasion on which defendant unlawfully delivered a controlled substance not issued in good faith and in the course of his professional practice as a licensed doctor of medicine. Defendant moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that it was unconstitutionally vague because it did not sufficiently define the term &quot;good faith.&quot; The trial court certified the question for supreme court review. The supreme court held that the term &quot;good faith&quot; was sufficiently defined to mean that the practitioner had to act in an honest endeavor to carry on his profession of healing patients; and therefore the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because the language employed conveyed a sufficiently definite meaning that a person who might be liable for the penalties of the Florida Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act would know that he was within its provisions or not.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that while the average juror knew full well the consequences of the verdicts of guilty and not guilty, he or she did not realize the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. The court concluded that because Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.390(a) required the trial court to instruct the jury on the penalty fixed by law for appellant's offense, the jury should also have been instructed on the ramifications of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, so as to eliminate any doubt the jury might have concerning the consequences of returning that verdict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery and first degree murder, and a death sentence was imposed. Defendant sought review of the conviction and the death sentence. The court held that the trial court properly inquired into whether defendant voluntarily made statements to the police and that the trial court did not err in finding that defendant's statements were voluntary. In addition, the court held that the trial court properly denied the requests to postpone the trial and to exclude a witness or to recess the trial because the trial court acted within its discretion to remedy any prejudice that possibly resulted from the state's breach of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.220(f). Furthermore, the court held that the trial court properly instructed the jury to consider whether the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, under Fla. Stat. ch. 921.141(5)(h). Moreover, the aggravating circumstances were properly considered. The court held that there were three aggravating circumstances and no mitigating factors, so the death penalty was proper. Therefore, the conviction and death sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because he used profane language while speaking to police officers in the presence of other persons, appellant was convicted of disorderly conduct in violation of Fla.

On appeal, the state supreme court reversed appellant's conviction and remanded the case. The court held that caselaw precedent required that in order to convict a person of disorderly conduct, the government had to show more than the use of words that were offensive to a part of the general population. The court held that the lower court's conviction of appellant did not meet constitutional standards. Appellant's use of profanity was protected speech because it did not invade the right of others to pursue their lawful activities, inflict injury, or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant sought review of his convictions for manslaughter and robbery. The court affirmed the convictions, finding that the evidence was sufficient to support a verdict of robbery because it established that appellant exerted physical force to extract the victim's purse from her grasp. The victim died as a result of injuries sustained when she fell. The court determined that the use of force by appellant elevated his action from larceny to robbery under Fla. Stat. ch. 812.13 (1975). The court determined that because appellant could be convicted of both felony-murder and the robbery that precipitated the murder, and because dual sentences could be imposed for those convictions, he could also be separately found guilty of the lesser-included offense of manslaughter and robbery. The court found that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by questioning a prosecution witness outside the presence of the jury in order to press the recollection of the witness on matter he had previously testified to under oath.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 828.04(1) by beating and battering the two-year old child of a woman with whom defendant was living. Defendant contended that that ch. 828.04(1) was unconstitutionally vague, that defendant's confession was improperly admitted, and that the prosecutor commented improperly during closing argument. The court concluded that ch. 828.04(1) was sufficiently clear that a person of ordinary intelligence could ascertain what conduct was proscribed when measured by common understanding and practice. Defendant's nod of his head to acknowledge waiver of his Miranda rights was sufficient, particularly because the trial court found that defendant's rights were explained to him and that he understood and appreciated them. Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.111(d)(4), which required a waiver to be written and witnessed, was inapplicable because it pertained to the representation of indigents. The prosecutor's comment, that defendant lacked the courage to admit and repent his conduct, was fair comment on defendant's testimony repudiating his confession. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, and that the lower court erred in refusing to give appellant's requested jury instruction relating to execution of a left turn as prescribed by Fla.

The court found that although the evidence was insufficient to support a charge that appellant was intoxicated for purposes of a conviction under Fla.

Stat. ch. 322.261(1) did not violate federal and state equal protection clauses and did not violate the U.S. Const. amend. IV.

Appellee refused to honor the claim due to late notice. Appellant filed suit. The trial court entered summary judgment for appellee, on late notice grounds. On appeal, the federal court certified two questions: (1) whether Florida or New York law governed the late notice issue, and (2) whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment for appellee.

Stat. ch. 404.02 (1971), though at the time of the delivery the drug in question was not specifically listed as illegal. After denial of his motion to dismiss, defendant pled no contest. Despite failure to reserve the right to appeal, defendant appealed. The lower court held that the definition of barbiturate was not unconstitutionally vague, and defendant appealed. The court held that except where a criminal defendant reserved the right to appeal a question of law, a no contest plea barred appeal of any issue other than the facial sufficiency of the charging instrument. Further, the court held that the no contest plea relieved the prosecution of its burden to prove that the drug in question was a barbiturate. Thus, the court held that the lower court's discussion of the constitutional validity of the statute was null and dismissed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

After initial answering of the question of whether appellants decedent's parents could recover net accumulations under Fla.

The lower court held the statute constitutional, and appellants sought review.

Defendant then appealed, arguing the statute was defective. The court held that even were there merit in the contention that the exemption in the statute for persons convicted of a felony whose civil rights had been restored was constitutionally defective for vagueness, defendant's conviction for violation of another subsection of the statute would still stand. Further, the court held that the exemption in question was clear and unambiguous and therefore constitutional. Thus, the court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued the report contained hearsay and opinion statements which were otherwise inadmissible, thereby infringing upon her constitutional rights of due process and confrontation of witnesses. In confirming the constitutionality of the statute authorizing the report, Fla. Stat. ch. 61.20, the court held the trial court had wide discretion where the future of young children were at stake. The statute provided the court with potentially valuable information, compiled by professional social workers. Appellant could have subpoenaed the case workers who prepared the report or any of the persons whom they had interviewed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to a public health crisis of rising liability insurance costs, the Florida legislature enacted Fla. Stat. ch. 768.133 requiring all medical malpractice claims to be submitted to mediation proceedings before claimants could pursue legal remedies in the courts. The court held that the pre-litigation burden cast upon a claimant by the statute was a reasonable exercise of the state's police power in the area of public heath and welfare. The court construed Fla. Stat. ch. 768.134(2) to mean that a physician's failure to participate in the administrative hearing was admissible in any subsequent civil medical malpractice trial and adopted Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.450(e) as a rule of procedure for all medical malpractice trials, barring references to insurance coverage or to joinder of insurers in the suit during the course of trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent power company sought an immediate temporary and permanent annual increase in its electric utility rates. The state public service commission published a notice that it would hold public hearings on the proposed rate increase, and public counsel intervened on behalf of petitioner citizens. At the hearings, public counsel did not present any witnesses or cross-examine respondent's witnesses because the commission stated that could be done at a later date. Later, the commission, without notice to either party, entered an order awarding respondent an interim rate increase. Thereafter, the commission awarded respondent a permanent rate increase. Petitioners challenged the order confirming the interim rate increase. On appeal, the court held the commission's procedural defect of not allowing public counsel to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses as promised did not alone establish a failure by respondent to justify the interim award. Due to inadequate findings in the commission's orders, the court was unable to tell if the interim rate increase was supported by competent and substantial evidence in the record. Thus the case was remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The director of the division of mental health refused to admit appellant and filed a motion to dismiss the circuit court's order to show cause. He claimed that appellant had to first be civilly committed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 394-467(3)(b). On review, the court agreed with the reasoning of the circuit court and found that the circuit court acted properly, pursuant to Fla. R. Crim.

Petitioner contended that even though he was imprisoned in another jurisdiction, Florida was required to provide an immediate parole revocation hearing within a reasonable time to avoid possible unconstitutional grievous loss of liberty. The court denied petitioner's request for relief, holding that petitioner's conduct caused him to be incarcerated by a jurisdiction distinct from the jurisdiction which placed him on parole. Petitioner was advised by his parole officer to request a hearing, but no proper request was made. Further, the court determined that if petitioner had been convicted of a Florida criminal offense, a revocation hearing in a reasonable time would be required.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee mental patients sought declaratory relief that would permanently enjoin appellant state officials from housing convicted felons in their mental hospital or establishing a medium security prison on the hospital's property. The trial court granted the requested relief, determining that the portion of Fla. Stat. ch. 945.025(3) that related to the conversion of the hospital was unconstitutional. The trial court held that if the plan were allowed, it would violate appellees' rights under the Baker Act, Fla. Stat. chs. 394.457(8), 394.459. The supreme court reversed the decision and remanded the case. The supreme court found no inconsistencies between the disputed statute and the prior enactments. Thus, the statute was constitutional and, as the last expression of the legislature's will, prevailed over previously enacted legislation. The court also ruled that absent a violation of due process or a specific constitutional guarantee, a court could not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature. Therefore, the trial court could not impose its own social view in place of a duly enacted statute passed by the legislature to obtain a result that it felt was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of judgments from the Dade County (Florida) trial court, which convicted appellants of conspiracy to commit an unnatural and lascivious act and committing an unnatural and lascivious act, Fla. Stat. ch. 800.02. Appellants contended that ch. 800.02 was unconstitutional, that the indictment failed to charge a crime, and that the prosecutor engaged in inflammatory closing argument that warranted a mistrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that a prosecutor was accorded wide latitude in closing argument, the court affirmed the convictions. The court summarily dismissed appellants' contention that Fla. Stat. ch. 800.02 was unconstitutional, and that the indictment therefore failed to charge a crime. Next, the court approvingly quoted from a prior opinion to the effect that there was probably very little that the prosecutor could have advanced in closing which would have been any more damning of appellants' conduct than the gruesome evidence which was presented from the witness stand. The court stated that the discussion of the evidence, so long as it remained within the limits of the record, was not to be condemned merely because the prosecutor appealed to the jury to perform their public duty by bringing in a guilty verdict. The court stated that it would not presume that jurors were influenced by impassioned eloquence, and that most errors in argument could be cured by an instruction. The court held that in accordance with Fla. Stat. ch. 924.33, a mistrial was reserved only for fundamental or prejudicial error which has been committed in the trial of such a nature as would vitiate the result.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellants' convictions for conspiracy to commit an unnatural and lascivious act and committing an unnatural and lascivious act. The court held that the statute criminalizing the act was constitutional, and that the prosecutor did not stray so far out of bounds in closing in arguing the gruesome nature of appellants' conduct as to warrant a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant department of natural resources sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court of Leon County, Second Judicial Circuit (Florida), which found for appellee fish and game commission and held that Fla. Stat. ch. 372.26, 372.925, 372.932 (1973), violated Fla. Const. art. IV, &sect; 9, in a lawsuit stemming from appellant's effort to control aquatic weeds by introducing a non-native fish species into a lake.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue was whether the Fla. Const. art. IV, &sect; 9, grant of all non-judicial powers of the state with respect to wild animal life and fresh water aquatic life to appellee department of fish and game barred any legislative intrusion into that apparently exclusive domain. Fla. Stat. ch. 372.26, 372.925, and 372.932 (1973) purported to grant certain powers to appellant department of natural resources to control noxious weeds in freshwater environments. The court reconciled the apparent conflict by citing to Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 7, which mandated that adequate provision was to be made by law for the abatement of water pollution. The court held that art. II, &sect; 7, saved the legislature's power to act in the manner described in the statutes at issue. The court stated that to hold the challenged statutes unconstitutional would strip the legislature of its power in many instances to carry out the policy of abatement of water pollution, as embodied in art. II, &sect; 7. The court stated that in construing the constitution it considered every section to give effect to the constitution as a harmonious whole, and it rejected a construction which denied effect to any part of the constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the judgment for appellee fish and game commission. The court held that the legislature had constitutional power to make laws aimed at abating water pollution, and could exercise this power to control noxious weeds in freshwater lakes by the introduction of a non-native fish species, not withstanding appellee's constitutional authority to exercise the state's nonjudicial power with respect to fresh water aquatic life.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was originally charged with driving while under the influence of alcoholic beverages, in violation of Fla.

Ann. &sect; 316.028(3)(Supp. 1974). Appellant challenged as unconstitutional the statute, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 322.281(1)(Supp. 1974), and rule, Florida Traffic Court Rule 6.290(a) because these statutes allegedly denied appellant equal protection of the laws by making conviction mandatory in drunken driving cases thus defendants on these specific charges were not equal before the law as required by Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 (1973). The court stated that progressive punishments prescribed in &sect; 316.028(4) were based upon subsequent offenses and time, but that the legislature had discretion to prescribe any punishment so long as it was not cruel or unusual, and that judicial interpretation could be aligned with affecting legislative intent of the statute and rule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted by a jury of rape, robbery, and assault with the intent to commit murder in the first degree. Prior to his trial, he challenged the Florida jury selection statute on constitutional grounds, arguing that it violated his constitutional right to jury trial and his right to equal protection of the law. The state supreme court, without elaboration, summarily rejected those arguments, holding that the statute was constitutional on its face and as applied. At trial, the trial court admitted a substantial amount of fact evidence which indicated appellant committed other similar crimes, but crimes for which he was not charged. Appellant argued that the admission of that evidence was reversible error. Holding that such evidence was admissible so long as it was not admitted to establish bad character or propensity to commit crimes, which the evidence in question in this case was not because said evidence was relevant to establish appellant's identity and pattern of behavior, the supreme court rejected appellant's argument and affirmed his convictions.</SPAN></P>

On account of appellee's interest in an out of state rectifying plant, appellant took the position that Fla. Stat. ch. 561.24 (1973) precluded renewal, and denied appellee's application. The circuit court ruled that appellee's license should be granted because appellee was entitled to the benefit of the grandfather clause, &sect; 561.24(5). However, the circuit court also considered and explicitly rejected appellee's argument that &sect; 561.24 was bad as a state constitutional matter. Appellant sought review. Appellee filed a cross-appeal and assigned as error the ruling that &sect; 561.24 prohibited renewal of its license, but for the grandfather clause. The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court and held that it was unnecessary to reach the constitutional question in order to decide the case. The court held that the grandfather clause applied to appellee as a liquor distributor that held a license as of June 3, 1947, without regard to whether appellee was affiliated with an out of state rectifier, distiller, or manufacture at that time.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a careful reading of the record demonstrated that the jury did not stretch the limits of its discretion in resolving the conflicts in the evidence in favor of the state. Also, the court disagreed with appellant's contentions that the statute he was charged under was unconstitutional. The court reasoned that there was a public interest in preventing the disruption of the orderly administration of police business. The court held that appellant's words may have been constitutionally protected, but the degree of loudness and the circumstances in which there were uttered took them out of the constitutionally protected area. However, the convictions were reversed and remanded so that the case could be considered by a properly charged jury that has been told to disregard appellant's words and to only consider the manner and circumstances of his behavior.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant's brief revealed no convincing argument on his behalf that his freedom of speech rights were violated. Further, the court held that the statute did not apply arbitrarily or discriminatorily to appellant. Thus, the court declared that appellant's activities fell within the language of Fla. Stat. ch. 821.01, the statute had not been unconstitutionally applied to appellant, and that he had not been deprived of his right to equal protection under the law. However, the court remanded the cause for the purpose of entering a proper judgement, because the judgment of the lower court failed to expressly adjudicate that appellant was guilty of the crime charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convict received a ten-year sentence of imprisonment for a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 806.05 (1969). Subsequently, appellant sought a reduction of his sentence based upon a new sentencing law with a lower maximum sentence, Fla. Stat. ch. 775.12 (1973) (repealed 1974). The lower court denied appellant's sentencing reduction. Appellant contended the lower court erred in this regard, and he also sought a new trial. On appeal to the state supreme court, the decision from the lower court was affirmed, and appellant's motion for a new trial was denied. The court held that the lower court properly determined that appellant was not entitled to a reduction in his sentence. The new sentencing law was not retroactive. Appellant was not entitled to a new trial based upon his claim that a police officer's violated his right to counsel and his claims that the lower court committed evidentiary errors, because the lower court properly disposed of these issues.</SPAN></P>

Appellant perfected service of process under Fla. Stat. ch. 49.11 and 49.12 by posting a notice in three prominent places in the county of residence and by mailing a notice to appellant's wife at the last known address. After appellant's wife failed to respond or appear at the proceedings, appellant filed a motion for a default judgment. The trial court denied the motion on the ground that Fla. Stat. ch. 49.10(b)(1) was unconstitutional. Appellant sought review of the decision. The court held that under the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, appellant, as an indigent, was afforded the right to access to the court for the purpose of dissolving his marriage. Furthermore, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 49.10(b)(1) was constitutional because it provided for a procedure that was reasonably calculated to provide actual notice in cases brought by indigents.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A public hearing examiner determined that appellee paper company caused a certain sum of damages based on a table of values for fish species found in Fla. Stat. ch. 403.141(3) (1973). Appellant state agency filed an action in the trial court pursuant to ch. 121(2)(a) (1969) to enforce the damages order against appellee. The court affirmed the trial court's action dismissing appellant's action with leave to amend. Chapter 121(2)(a), which eliminated a defendant's right to require a judicial determination of liability and damages prior to enforcement of an administrative order, was not enacted when the fish kill occurred. The statute was a substantive change in the law and, therefore, was not to be retroactively applied. Fla. Stat. ch. 403.141(3) was constitutional. There was nothing wrong with the statute establishing a method for determining the value of fish killed. However, the statute did not conclusively prescribe a specific amount of damages for a species of fish killed. The fish table values were relevant as to damages and admissible as evidence, but that evidence was subject to rebuttal, and it was up to the trier of fact to make the final determination on damages.</SPAN></P>

They did not allege that their rights would be adversely affected, much less the nature or type of injury which they might sustain. Such allegations did not constitute ultimate facts required to sustain their standing to attack the statute's constitutionality. Appellees probationers alleged that the type and quality of rehabilitation and supervision over them would be impacted by the statute. There was no reasonable probability that the asserted negative impacts would come to fruition. The pleadings of none of the appellees alleged facts showing that a question existed which required declaratory relief. Therefore, appellees lacked standing to maintain their suit.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 39.03(5)(a) and Fla. Stat. ch. 39.03(5)(b) were constitutional. The factors pertaining to the place of detention were directory and must be read together with the applicable juvenile rules. The supreme court held that the trial court judge had the discretion to determine the place of detention. The supreme court also held that Fla. Stat. ch. 39.03(7)(a) and Fla.

The court reasoned that that statute was not vague as to warrant it unconstitutional. The court declared that a statute should be construed in such a manner as to effectuate legislative intent and in favor of upholding its constitutionality. Moreover the court held that the statute was not an unlawful delegation of legislative authority because adequate standards had been announced in the act to guide the administrative agencies in the exercise of the delegated powers consistent with constitutional dictates.</SPAN></P>

The police observed another bag of marijuana on defendant's car seat and seized it. The police then entered the motel room without permission and seized a suitcase. The court affirmed the decision to uphold the search and seizures. The initial entry into the motel room was illegal. However, the police had every right to stop defendant based on his suspicious conduct and the their knowledge from non-officers that defendant possessed marijuana. The officers had legally sufficient information to constitute probable cause for an arrest and there was no basis to exclude the drugs thrown from the car. The drugs in defendant's car were in plain view and therefore legally seized. The evidence in the motel room was admissible because a warrant was issued based on legally obtained information that drugs would be found there.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 509.151. Appellant had unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the charge on the grounds that Fla. Stat. ch. 509.151 was unconstitutional. Appellant claimed the statute created an impermissible presumption of intent to defraud when certain elements were proven in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and U.S. Const. amend. V. The court disagreed, holding that constitutional guarantees were not violated as long as there was a rational connection between the fact proven and the ultimate fact presumed and reasonable opportunity was afforded to rebut the presumption. Further, the prima facie evidence of intent to defraud provided by Fla. Stat. ch. 509.151 was no more of an incursion into the right against self-incrimination and the right to present proof beyond a reasonable doubt than other presumptions upheld by the courts. Finally, in light of the specific statutory criteria required to provide the prima facie evidence of intent, the court found the statutory language of the presumption to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged a decision of the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit Court in and for Brevard County (Florida) that upheld the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 180.191 in that it authorized cities to charge non-city resident users 1.5 times the rates charged city resident users.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed a class action complaint against appellee municipal corporation for themselves and all others similarly situated. The complaint alleged that the rates charged them, as non-city residents, for water service were not based on the same factors used in fixing the rates for city customers. Appellants maintained that Fla. Stat. ch. 180.191 was unconstitutional. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss arguing that appellants failed to allege ultimate facts, which entitled them to relief, and failed to state a cause of action. The lower court granted the motion and upheld the constitutionality of the statute, holding that the statute authorized appellee to charge non-city resident users 1.5 times the rates charged city resident users. The supreme court affirmed the lower court's decision as it related to the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 180.191. The supreme court held that a different rate could be charged it if was justified because of the difference in cost to furnish service to those outside the city limits. The supreme court reversed the lower court's decision regarding its choice to dismiss appellants' complaint because it stated a cause of action against appellee.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court affirmed in part and reversed in part the lower court's decision and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. The supreme court found that the applicable statute was constitutional but that the trial court was not correct in dismissing appellants' complaint with prejudice because the allegations in the complaint stated a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Appeal, First District (Florida), certified two questions arising from respondent's conviction for aggravated assault: Did the trial court err in refusing to instruct the jury on the applicable penalties as provided by Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.390(a), and did the trial court err in refusing to instruct the jury as to certain lesser-included offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed a judgment holding that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct on lesser-included offenses but did err in refusing to instruct on applicable penalties. Respondent was convicted of aggravated assault. The trial court instructed the jury on assault with intent to commit murder in the first and second degrees, assault with intent to commit manslaughter, aggravated battery, and aggravated assault; however, the trial court wrongly refused to instruct the jury on assault and battery and bare assault. Proof of the greater offense of assault with intent to commit murder was also proof of the necessarily included lesser offense of bare assault and, therefore, an instruction on bare assault should have been given. Because respondent was charged with assault with the intent to commit murder and also of causing physical contact with the victim, then the greater crime of assault with intent to commit murder included the lesser crime of assault and battery. Accordingly, an instruction on assault and battery should have been given. The court also noted its interim decision that resolved that a trial court was not required to instruct on applicable penalties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the judgment which held that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct on applicable penalties and did not err in refusing to instruct on lesser offenses. An interim decision held that a trial court was not obliged to instruct on applicable penalties. The trial court erred in refusing to instruct on the lesser-included offenses because proof of the lesser offenses was necessary to prove the offenses charged.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was overwhelming evidence to support a finding of guilt on all charges and there were no mitigating circumstances. The court held that allegedly improper remarks made by the prosecutor were not unduly inflammatory in light of statements made by the defense, and the remarks amounted to harmless error when the totality of the record and the uniquely vicious crimes were considered.

The court held that imposition of the death sentence pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082, 782.04, and 921.141 was not in violation of either the Florida or United States Constitution.

The court held that the trial court's dictation into the record his findings of fact for imposing a sentence of death provided the opportunity for meaningful review as required by &sect; 921.141.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, tax assessor, reclassified land owned by appellee as nonagricultural under the statutory presumption in Fla. Stat. ch. 193.461(4)(c). The court found Fla. Stat. ch. 193.461(4)(c) to be unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative authority without adequate standards and guidelines and a contravention of the constitutional requirement that assessment be made solely on the basis of character or use. The court held that that Fla. Stat. ch. 193.461(4)(c) did not delegate legislative authority without proper guidelines and held that the phrase &quot;special circumstances,&quot; indicating what must be shown to overcome the statutory presumption, had to be read in pari materia with Fla. Stat. ch. 193.461(3)(b), which contained the criteria for determination of taxable status. The appellate court held that the constitutional provision was permissive, not mandatory and that the legislature could constitutionally remove the favored treatment for agricultural property. The rational presumption imposed by the legislature was that land purchased for three or more times its assessed agricultural value was not intended to be put to agricultural use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, owners of gas pipelines, sought review of an order upholding constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 366.065 (1973)(Act). Appellants had sought a declaration that the Act was unconstitutional. The circuit court granted appellees, purchasers of natural gas, summary judgment. This appeal followed. Appellants contended the Act exceeded standards for the exercise of police power of the state, that the absence of standards in the Act made it an invalid delegation of legislative authority, and that the title was defective. The court concluded the Act was unconstitutional because it was an improper exercise of the state's police power. To be valid, the police power had to apply to the general public as distinguished from a particular group or class. Further, the title of the Act did not meet the mandate of Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 6 (1968) that the subject of all legislation shall be briefly expressed in the title. That provision assured adequate notice to legislators and to the public with respect to impending legislation. The court concluded that the legislature could not authorize price ceilings through customer initiative while leaving all other aspects of industry unregulated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review from the Circuit Court for Alachua County (Florida), which entered a final judgment permanently enjoining it from enforcing a moratorium on the construction of underground petroleum storage tanks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state had preempted the field of regulation of underground petroleum storage tanks pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 376.30-376.317 (1986). Appellant county enacted an ordinance imposing stricter standards upon storage tanks and attempted to enforce it prior to obtaining approval from the Department of Environmental Regulation (DER). Appellant adopted an ordinance which imposed a temporary moratorium upon the issuance of building permits for the construction of underground petroleum storage tanks. Appellee brought an action for declaratory and injunctive relief, seeking to have the moratorium declared invalid. The trial court issued a temporary injunction against enforcement of the moratorium. On review, appellant argued that there was a difference between an ordinance that stopped activity, and an ordinance that imposed affirmative standards that must be met in order to engage in the activity. The court rejected this argument and affirmed the final judgment. The court held that the legislature had preempted the field of regulation of underground petroleum storage tanks and appellant's ordinance operated as an unauthorized regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the lower court enjoining appellant county from enforcing a moratorium on the construction of underground petroleum storage tanks was affirmed because the legislature had preempted the field of regulation of underground petroleum storage tanks and appellant's ordinance operated as an unauthorized regulation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), which granted appellee's motion for a mitigated sentence because of prosecutorial misconduct under Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(4) (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellee and an accomplice were arrested for drug trafficking, both entered guilty pleas based on the state's advice that each could reduce his sentence by rendering substantial assistance. Thereafter, the state petitioned to reduce the accomplice's sentence, but not appellee's. The trial court granted appellee's motion to mitigate his sentence and the state sought review. The court reversed because the record of the sentencing hearing contradicted the trial court's findings of abuse and overreaching by the state. Without such conduct, the trial court lacked the authority to grant appellee's motion. The state did not deem appellee's assistance sufficient to warrant a reduction of sentence. The disparity between the sentences imposed on appellee and his accomplice was not a denial of equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the sentence and remanded with instructions to the trial court to sentence appellee under the trafficking statute, or to permit him to withdraw his plea of guilty. Absent misconduct by the state, the trial court lacked the authority to reduce the sentence for &quot;substantial assistance.&quot;</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged an order of final summary judgment made by the Circuit Court for Marion County (Florida) that denied them any relief against appellees, attorneys who represented them in an earlier medical malpractice suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants alleged that appellees breached their duty to provide them with reasonable legal services and advice in a medical malpractice suit, because the settlement figure was substantially less than what the claims were worth. In addition, they alleged that appellees had seriously compromised the ultimate success of the suit by letting the two-year statute of limitations run. The trial court decided that appellants were equitably estopped to assert claims against appellees because they agreed to the settlement and accepted the funds after they became aware of the statute of limitations problem. On appeal, the court found no affirmative showing that the parties intended the settlement to operate as a final adjudication of another issue. The court also noted that the causes of action and issues in the two suits were clearly not the same. The second suit involved whether appellees committed legal malpractice in their first suit. Additionally, the court noted that there were issues sufficiently raised by the record and were not barred by appellants' prior settlement as a matter of law. Accordingly, the summary judgment for appellees was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the final summary judgment against appellees because the record in the case raised material issues of fact that should not have been cut short in appellees' favor by the summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner department of corrections sought a writ of certiorari to review an order from the Circuit Court for Pasco County (Florida), which required payment of attorney's fees in excess of the maximum authorized by Fla. Stat. ch. 925.035(4) (1987). Petitioner challenged payment of attorney's fees in excess of the statutory maximum to respondent attorney for his representation of a condemned murderer in clemency proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, department of corrections, was ordered to pay respondent attorney $ 4,595 in attorney's fees for respondent's representation of a condemned murderer in clemency proceedings. Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to review the order because the amount exceeded the maximum fee authorized under Fla. Stat. ch. 925.035(4) (1987). The court held that the trial court had the power to exceed the statutory fee cap in exceptional cases. Capital cases by their very nature were considered extraordinary and unusual and arguably justified an award of attorney's fees in excess of the statutory maximum fee cap. The court held that since the legislature endowed the trial court with the responsibility of selecting and appointing attorneys to represent defendants in clemency proceedings, the trial court also had some leeway to fairly compensate respondent. Accordingly, the court denied petitioner's request for writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner's request for writ of certiorari because the trial court had the authority to exceed the statutory fee cap and award respondent attorney fees in excess of the cap. The court noted that the case involved a capital offense that, by its very nature, was considered extraordinary under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court, Alachua County (Florida) finding that 1988 Fla. Law ch. 88-156, &sect; 18 (amending Fla. Stat. ch. 376.317), designed to regulate underground petroleum storage tanks, was an unconstitutional violation of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6, Fla. Const.&nbsp;art. III, &sect;10, and Fla. Const. art. III, &sect;11(b).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county attempted to regulate underground petroleum tanks by an ordinance which was much more stringent than state and federal environmental standards. After appellee company successfully enjoined enforcement of the ordinance, the state legislature tacked on an amendment to a construction regulation statute which incorporated the stringent regulations applicable only to appellant. 1988 Fla. Law ch. 88-156, &sect; 18 (amending Fla. Stat. ch. 376.317) permitted appellant to adopt ordinances regulating underground petroleum tanks that were more stringent than state law. Appellant sought review after the lower court found that ch. 88-156 was unconstitutional. The court found that ch. 88-156 was a local or special law, as it applied only to appellant. Because notice of the law was not published in accordance with requirements for general laws, ch. 88-156 violated Fla. Const. art III, &sect;10. The court found that ch. 88-156 violated the single-subject requirement of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect;6 in that it contained multiple, unrelated subjects. The provisions of ch. 88-156 were not germane to the construction industry, the subject of the pending act it amended. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that an amendment regulating underground petroleum tanks which was tacked on to a construction industry regulation statute was unconstitutional was affirmed. The amendment was a local law that applied only to appellant county, and was unconstitutional because it did not comply with general law notification requirements. It also unconstitutionally violated the single-subject rule, as it did not relate to the construction industry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of orders from the Circuit Court for Volusia County (Florida) that denied their motions to suppress evidence in their convictions for trafficking in cocaine in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(3) (1985). They argued that the initial stop of their car by a state trooper was invalid and therefore the consent given to search the car was tainted by the prior illegal police action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A state trooper testified that when appellants' car passed his observation point he thought it was speeding. After determining it was not, he stopped appellants for following another car too closely, Fla. Stat. ch. 316.0895(1) (1985), and issued a written warning. He also asked for and received written consent to search the vehicle, which resulted in the discovery of cocaine. Holding that the initial stop of appellant's vehicle was properly made in part for the purpose of &quot;advertising&quot; police presence on the highways, the court affirmed the orders that denied appellants' motions to suppress. The court held that the stop was valid despite the trooper's candid admission that appellants also exhibited some characteristics of a drug carrier profile previously invalidated by the court. Having found that the stop was valid, the court held that the preponderance of the evidence was the burden the state had to meet, and did meet, to prove that appellants had freely and voluntarily given consent to search the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders that denied appellants' motion to suppress, and affirmed their drug trafficking convictions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the order from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) that convicted him of driving under the influence manslaughter, driving with a suspended license, and violation of probation. Appellant claimed that the trial court erred by admitting statements he made during the accident investigation pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.066(4) and that police testimony included improper comments on his right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was involved in an accident and was convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) manslaughter, driving with a suspended license, and violation of probation. On appeal, the court held that because appellant was required by Fla. Stat. ch. 316.066(4) (1987) to cooperate in the accident investigation and was not told when the accident investigation ended and the criminal investigation began, the trial court erred by admitting statements appellant made to police about the accident. The court found that the trial court's jury instructions created an unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable presumption on the issue of impairment with respect to appellant's blood alcohol content, and that certain aspects of two police officers' testimony could be fairly susceptible to an interpretation that they were comments on appellant's right to remain silent. The court found no errors in the convictions for driving with a suspended license and probation violation. Therefore, the court reversed the judgment with respect to the DUI manslaughter charge, remanded the case for a new trial on that charge, and affirmed it in all other respects.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the conviction for driving under the influence manslaughter, remanded the case for a new trial on that charge, and affirmed the remaining convictions, because appellant was not told when the questions about the accident were part of the criminal investigation, thus it was error to admit appellant's statements about the accident, and police testimony could be construed as comments on his right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of a decision from the County Court of Dade County (Florida), which granted appellee's motion to suppress blood analysis in a drunk driving case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol after his blood alcohol level (BAL) tested above .10 percent. In deposition, the state's toxicologist stated that he could not testify within a reasonable degree of scientific certainty what appellee's BAL was when he was driving and that the BAL could have been lower than .10 percent when appellee was driving. Appellee moved to suppress the test. He argued that the reading was irrelevant because it did not prove his BAL at the exact time he was driving and that the prejudicial effect of the chemical test outweighed its probative value. The trial court granted the motion. The state sought review, and the trial court submitted a certified question of whether the test was admissible evidence when the state's witness could not testify that the BAL tested was the BAL at the time of driving. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that the result of a properly administered BAL test was relevant evidence and that a failure to extrapolate the result back to the time of driving went to the weight given to the evidence rather than its admissibility. The court further certified the question to the state supreme court.</SPAN></P>

After appellant made modifications, appellee issued a notice of intent to issue the permit. Intervenors requested a formal administrative hearing. Appellant agreed to further modifications and a plan to mitigate adverse effects. The hearing officer recommended denial of the permit because it was not in the public interest and was not necessary. Appellee adopted the recommendation and denied the application for the permit. On appeal, the court reversed the order that denied the permit because appellee was statutorily required to specify what changes would make the project acceptable.

Stat. ch. 800.04 (1983) and one count of sexual battery in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(4)(e) (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied a petition for writ of prohibition and affirmed an order denying petitioner's motion to dismiss the charges against him as barred by the statute of limitations in effect on the date of the alleged offenses. Petitioner was charged by an amended information in 1989 with the commission, between January and August 1983, of two counts of lewd and lascivious assault upon a child in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04 (1983) and one count of sexual battery in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(4)(e) (1983). The state's delay in filing these charges was due to the victim's delay in reporting the incident. At the time of the amended filing, the alleged child victim was 19 years of age. The court held that the 1985 amendment to Fla. Stat. ch. 775.15(7) did not constitute an unconstitutional ex post facto law. This amendment reflected a clear legislative intent to extend prosecutions for violations of Fla. Stat. ch.  794.011 and Fla. Stat. ch. 800.04 to those offenses not time-barred on or before December 31, 1984. The limitation period under the old statute had not run against petitioner. Thus, the amendment did not inflict additional punishment on petitioner.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contractor was charged with embezzlement in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 713.34(3) (1985).

In reversing in part, the court held that the entire statute was not unconstitutional. There was nothing unconstitutional about charging defendant with embezzlement because he had used the proceeds of payments for purposes other than to pay for the specific materials or improvements for which the money was received. Defendant's failure to pay for labor, services, or materials after receipt of funds for those specific services or materials constituted prima facie evidence of intent to defraud.

The court found in the record that the possible basis for this departure was the trial judge's feeling that such a sentence would be inappropriate given the circumstances of the case. The court held that this feeling was not a valid reason for guideline departure. However, appellee argued that the trial court might have considered appellee's drug addiction as a reason for departure. Thus, the court remanded for clarification. Further, the court rejected appellee's arguments that Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(e) was unconstitutional. Also, the court held that there could be dual convictions and dual sentences for purchase and possession of the same cocaine under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.021.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant defendant challenged his convictions on four counts of engaging in sexual activity with his stepdaughter, a child under eighteen years of age, with whom he stood in a position of familial or custodial authority. On appeal, the court issued an opinion and appellant brought a motion for rehearing. On rehearing, the court reversed one conviction because the child was unable to testify with certainty that appellant abused her between specific dates as was specified in the amended information. The court affirmed the trial court's admission of collateral evidence of sexual assault because no objection was made to its admission at trial and so the issue was waived on appeal, despite an earlier denied motion in limine. Finally, the court held that the testimony of appellant's sister was properly admitted despite being about events 19 years in the past because the opportunity to sexually batter children in the familial setting often occurred only generationally, and so the passage of time did not affect the reliability of the evidence. The court remanded for resentencing on the three remaining convictions and for recalculating the amount of restitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant hospital terminated plaintiff doctor's medical staff privileges because he complained about defendant's administration to the press and to a state agency. A jury awarded plaintiff compensatory and punitive damages. On appeal, the court granted defendant a new trial because the trial court erred in admitting evidence of defendant's committee proceedings, which violated Fla. Stat. ch. 768.40(4) (1981). The court reasoned that although defendant's committees were not entirely composed of members of the medical staff, to permit disclosure would constitute an &quot;end run&quot; around the legislative ban on disclosure of other medical staff committee proceedings. Next, the court determined that plaintiff's evidence indicating that his termination was not based on his competency as a physician created a liability issue for the jury as to whether defendant acted in good faith and without malice. The court found that plaintiff had no constitutional due process claim because defendant was a private hospital, but he did have a statutory due process claim under Fla. Stat. ch. 395.065.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that awarded damages to plaintiff doctor in his lawsuit that challenged the termination of his medical staff privileges. The court remanded the case for a new trial because the trial court should not have admitted into evidence the proceedings of defendant hospital's committees that made the decision to terminate plaintiff's staff privileges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation challenged the order of the Florida Department of Transportation, that required appellant, under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation relied on the statement from a representative of appellee Florida Department of Transportation that a permit was not required to erect a billboard near a particular intersection. However, a hearing examiner subsequently determined that the sign was unauthorized, and appellee ordered that the sign be removed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 479.105(1)(1985), because it was adjacent to an interstate highway and erected without a permit. The court determined that the statutory authority to regulate the sign depended on whether it was &quot;on&quot; the interstate and that appellee had erroneously deviated from the statutory terms of Fla. Stat. ch. 479.07(1)(1987). The court held that the word &quot;on&quot; was to be given its ordinary meaning within the statutory context. The ordinary usage of a structure being &quot;on&quot; a particular street meant the roadway to which it fronted and that meaning was consistent with the common practice in the billboard industry. The court reversed the order that required appellant to remove the sign because the sign was on a different road, and not on the interstate and, therefore, was outside appellee's jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order that required appellant corporation to remove its billboard because the ordinary meaning of the word &quot;on&quot; established that the billboard was on a state road and not on the interstate highway, and, thus, was beyond the jurisdiction of appellee Florida Department of Transportation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner contended on appeal that the trial court had jurisdiction to issue a writ of prohibition to require appellee director of a water management district to refrain from action as to appellant's land based on the trial court's exclusive and original jurisdiction over tax assessments and classification of land as agricultural for tax purposes, pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 20(c)(3). Appellant argued that, because his land had an agricultural classification for tax purposes under Fla. Stat. ch. 193.61, it fell within the exemptions to surface water management for agricultural land. Thus, appellant maintained that appellee erred in refusing to grant appellant an agricultural exemption with regard to water management. The court affirmed the trial court's order that dismissed appellant's petition for a writ of prohibition, as the issue of classification of property by an appraiser and its binding effect was not within the jurisdiction of the trial court pursuant to Fla.

On first review the court affirmed, then voted to en banc the case, and the trial court was directed to inform the court whether any extension of the period set out in Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.612(d) had been requested by appellant because the record was silent as to whether any such request had been made. The trial court reported that no such request had been made, and the court vacated its prior decision and reversed the trial court. The court held that rule 1.612(d) required the trial judge to enter a judgment on the petition within 48 hours, and failure to do so resulted in the petition being deemed granted and required the clerk to issue a certificate to that effect. The court held that the trial court had failed to issue its judgment within the time frame. The case was remanded for issuance of the certificate by the clerk.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an insurer, challenged the decision by the Circuit Court for Volusia County (Florida), which dismissed its action seeking reimbursement from appellee, its insured, under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant paid personal insurance benefits (PIP) to one of appellee's employees, who was involved in a car accident in one of appellee's commercial vehicles, appellant filed a claim seeking reimbursement of the PIP benefits paid pursuant to Fla. Sta. ch. 627.7405. The trial court dismissed appellant's action with prejudice and found ch. 627.7405 unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clauses of the U.S. Const. and Fla. Const. Upon appellant's challenge, the court reversed the trial court. The court found that while ch. 627.7405 created a classification between owners and insurers of commercial vehicles and owners and insurers of all other vehicles, the distinction in the classifications was reasonable and non-arbitrary. The court found that insurance was an appropriate subject for legislative control and that ch. 627.7405 had a reasonable relationship to the legitimate state interest of regulating insurance and did not violate the exclusivity principle embodied in worker's compensation statutes. Accordingly, the court found that ch. 627.7405 was constitutional and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant injured party was the victim of a collision when her automobile was struck by a truck. Appellant filed an action against appellees, truck owner and truck driver, in which she sought recovery for injuries sustained. Appellant filed motions for directed verdicts on the issues of liability and the permanency of her injury, but the trial court denied both motions. The court reversed in part, holding that appellant's motion for directed verdict on the issue of liability should have been granted because appellee truck driver failed to rebut or dissipate the presumption that his negligence was the sole proximate cause of the accident. As to the permanency of appellant's injury, the court held that appellant's motion for directed verdict was properly denied because the jury was free in this ordinary negligence action to accept or reject the testimony of a medical expert. Although the jury failed to understand and apply the jury instructions when they returned an award in appellant's favor, despite not having found any permanent injury under Fla. Stat. 627.737(2) (1987), appellant was not entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Following appellant's release from prison, appellant was found to be violation of community control. The trial court revoked his youthful offender status and sentenced him under the sentencing guidelines to eight years in prison. On appeal, appellant alleged that the trial court erred in its sentencing. The court determined that although the trial court could revoke appellant's youthful offender status, the maximum term appellant could be sentenced to was six years with credit for time served. The court also sustained appellant's objections to the trial court's actions based on appellant's allegation that he was improperly sentenced under the sentencing guidelines, and that his conviction for both armed robbery and a display of a firearm during commission of a felony constituted multiple punishment for the same conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant weapon owner sought review of an order from appellee Florida Department of State, Division of Licensing, which revoked appellant's license for carrying a concealed weapon or firearm, pursuant to the authority of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, appellant weapon owner contended that the revocation of his license had been inappropriate because when appellant had pleaded nolo contendere to the two felony charges in 1987, Fla.

Appellant further contended that the retroactive application of the statute was unconstitutional. The appellate court rejected the constitutional challenge to Fla. Stat. ch. 790.06(2)(k), finding that the statute was a valid enactment because a license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm was a privilege and not a vested right. The appellate court affirmed, finding that the revocation of appellant's license was appropriate in light of the unequivocal language of the state legislature in mandating that Fla.

Over the course of time since the cemetery was first established, the street on which it was located became heavily commercial for miles in either direction. The city commission denied the zoning request and respondent sought circuit court review. The circuit court reversed and city petitioned for a writ of certiorari to challenge its findings. Notwithstanding the rules, which weighed heavily in favor of sustaining the validity of zoning restriction, the police power used to enforce the zoning restriction was not unlimited. The court affirmed the decision because it found it was not fairly debatable that petitioner had misused its police power for reverse spot zoning. Petitioner had persisted in enforcing zoning restrictions even though it had since rezoned most of the adjoining area and relieved virtually all property owners in the same area of the same zoning restriction, thereby resulting in a transformation in the character of the area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insurer challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) granting summary judgment in favor of appellee insured on her complaint that insurer had stopped paying personal injury protection benefits in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(7)(a) (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was treated by a chiropractor for injuries sustained in an automobile accident. Appellant insurer stopped paying personal injury protection (PIP) benefits as a result of an independent medical evaluation by an orthopedic surgeon. Appellee sued, alleging that appellee's withdrawal of PIP benefits violated Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(7)(a) (1987) because appellant could not withdraw payment to the chiropractor unless appellant first obtained a report by another chiropractor. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court reversed. Although ch. 627.736(7)(a) did not violate Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6, the statute impaired the obligation of appellant's contract and thus violated Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 because ch. 627.736(7)(a) became effective after the policy had been issued and payments had started on appellee's claim. The court also ruled that appellant could use any physician of its choice to perform an independent examination as ch. 627.736(7)(a) only related to the type of physician whose report could be used to terminate benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision granting summary judgment to appellee insured as it found that statute limiting the type of physician whose report could be used to withdraw personal injury protection benefits did not apply to appellee's claim as the statute became effective after the time the policy was issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1971, appellant pled guilty to and was convicted for an offense under Fla. Stat. ch. 800.01 (1971). A few months after his conviction, the statute was declared unconstitutional. However, appellant did not challenge his conviction. Several years later, appellant was convicted for two counts of driving under the influence manslaughter, which resulted in his prior conviction assuming an unanticipated significance. Therefore, appellant filed a motion for postconviction relief and a petition for writ of error coram nobis seeking to vacate the prior conviction. The trial court denied both his motion and his petition, and appellant challenged. The court affirmed the denial of appellant's motion because the motion was barred by the two-year limitation period of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. The court also affirmed the denial of the petition for writ of error coram nobis because coram nobis was not an appropriate remedy under the circumstances of the case. The court, however, did not hold that appellant did not have some remedy to eliminate the continuing collateral consequences of an invalid conviction; rather, the court held that the remedy, which he sought here, was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought reversal of a nonfinal order of the Circuit Court for Pinellas County, (Florida), which denied his motion for summary judgment in a forfeiture action filed by appellee city pursuant to Fla. R. App. P. 9.130(a)(3)(C)(ii), where several items of personal property were seized in a criminal matter, and continued to be held after its resolution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found appellant's motion for summary judgment should have been granted as to items of personal property seized in a criminal matter. A criminal court of competent jurisdiction had already ordered the return of some of the items listed in the forfeiture petition, and appellant had timely raised the previous order as an affirmative defense. Thus, it reversed the lower court, holding that the criminal court had jurisdiction to enter the order returning the property. Had the city filed within the time limit set by the legislature, the parties would have had proper notice, and the criminal court would not have been misinformed about the filing of the forfeiture petition. The civil court acted beyond its authority in vacating a valid order of the criminal court, and erred in denying the motion for summary judgment. Because there was a conflict between jurisdictions, and the issue was of great public importance, the court certified a question to the Florida Supreme Court. The question was whether a civil forfeiture action divested a criminal court of jurisdiction over property seized when filed after the ninety-day period specified in Fla. Stat. ch. 932.703(1).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property appraiser challenged a final judgment of the Circuit Court for Pinellas County, (Florida), arguing that it had no authority to reduce his assessment of appellant property owner's property value for a shopping center because Fla. Stat. ch. 193.011 (1985) presumed his assessment was correct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed summary judgment in favor of appellee property owner, finding substantial competent evidence that appellant property appraiser, by not actually using the rental income as a factor in arriving at his assessment, assessed the property in excess of fair market value. Sub-market rental income from a long-term lease on real property should have been weighed in arriving at a proper valuation of the property for ad valorem tax purposes. To the extent actual income was permitted to be ignored, the valuation was clearly in error. The court held that the income approach should have received at least some application, and that sub-market rent was not a valid foundation for totally rejecting that approach. The court ascribed error to appellant's failure to use the income approach for the valuation of property under the circumstances of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment for appellee property owner was affirmed because although appellant appraiser's assessment enjoyed a statutory presumption of correctness, where he failed to take the income approach into account, the lower court was justified in overturning his assessment of property value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed her conviction for driving while intoxicated manslaughter. She argued that the trial court erred by instructing the jury to apply a mandatory rebuttable presumption on the issue of intoxication. The court held that the instruction may lead to the use of a jury instruction that was unconstitutional because it shifted the burden of proving innocence to the defendant. However, constitutional error did not always mandate reversal of a conviction. An error in a jury instruction that created a mandatory rebuttable presumption may be harmless where the evidence of the presumed element was overwhelming. After applying this standard to the present case, the court concluded that it was not necessary to reverse defendant's conviction. Evidence of the presumed element of impairment due to the influence of alcohol was overwhelming, and it could be said beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have convicted defendant absent the defective instruction given.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the trial court's conviction of the defendant, holding that while the trial court erred by instructing the jury to apply a mandatory rebuttable presumption on the issue of intoxication, the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his sentence for burglary of a dwelling and petit theft, on the ground that the lower court improperly considered his juvenile record under the sentencing guidelines, and that the sentencing guidelines were an abrogation of the separation of powers under Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3. The court held that because the sentencing guidelines were adopted by the legislature under Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.701(d)(5), they were not in conflict with the separation of powers doctrine. The court reasoned that the last expression of legislative will would prevail where statutory provisions could be reconciled. Because the statute was last amended in the form of a rule of criminal procedure, the intent of the legislature was to amend Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of decision holding its fee provisions for review of applications unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The trial court stated that the statutes contained no guidelines or standards for setting fees and no limitation on how much can be assessed of the reviewing costs of its application. The appellate court found that the authority to promulgate the rule was within an exception to the non-delegation rule as a regulation necessary to protect the general welfare, morals, and safety of the public. The crucial test in determining whether a statute amounted to an unlawful delegation was whether the statute contained sufficient standards or guidelines to determine whether the agency carried out the legislature's intent. The court held that the legislature intended to enable appellant to recover some or all of its costs of the review process from developers instead of taxpayers and that the rule was limited by its own terms to the costs resulting from the review process alone. The court also found that that the fees levied were merely technical implementations of a fundamental legislative policy decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgement of the trial court was reversed because the trial court erred in finding rules were promulgated pursuant to statutory authorities that unlawfully delegated legislative power.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Palm Beach County (Florida), which dismissed appellants' medical malpractice suit against appellees, a hospital corporation and individual physicians, for failure to follow the pre-suit screening process required by Fla. Stat. ch. 768.57 (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, a hospital and named physicians, argued that appellants' failure to file notices of intent to initiate litigation for medical malpractice, before filing their complaint, justified the trial court's dismissal of the malpractice action. Specifically, appellees asserted, Fla. Stat. ch. 768.57 (1985) made the notice requirement a precondition to filing suit and allowed for dismissal, with prejudice, following appellants' failure to comply. The court disagreed, ruling first that the malpractice statute was constitutional, having a valid purpose in protecting the public, and that appellants' failure to comply with the notification requirement did not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. However, the court reasoned, the trial court erred in dismissing appellants' action with prejudice. Even though the condition precedent to filing suit was not met, the filing of the notices within the statutory limitation period tolled the running of the statute and allowed time for amending the complaint to meet the statutory prerequisites. The court concluded that if appellants had taken a contrary position and simply refused to comply, dismissal would have been justified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mortgagee challenged the order of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) that dismissed with prejudice appellant's third amended complaint and alternatively granted summary judgment in favor of appellee alleged mortgagor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered an order dismissing appellant mortgagee's third amended complaint and alternatively granting summary judgment in favor of appellee alleged mortgagor. Appellant sought review. In 1979, appellee and her husband assumed a mortgage. The mortgage stated that the mortgagor covenanted and agreed to pay promptly when due the principal and interest and other sums of money provided for in said note and mortgage. Appellee and her husband were later divorced. It appeared without contradiction that appellee never signed or guaranteed the underlying promissory note that matured in May 1982. It was further clear that appellee did not request an extension of the obligation either orally or in writing. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 95.281 (Supp. 1974), the lien of a mortgage encumbering real property terminated five years after the date of maturity where the final maturity of the obligation was ascertainable from the record. The lien expired in May 1987, months before the suit was filed in October 1987. The action was barred. The trial court was correct in its dismissal and alternative entry. The court of appeal also disagreed with appellant's other arguments. Judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal affirmed the order that dismissed with prejudice appellant mortgagee's third amended complaint and alternatively granted summary judgment for appellee alleged mortgagor. Appellant's action was barred by state statute. Additionally, there was no error in the determination that neither fraud nor fraud in the inducement occurred. Appellant's claim arguing the unconstitutionality of the statute was not raised and presented below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state challenged the decision from the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) which dismissed an information against appellee based upon a determination that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with possession of child pornography in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 827.071(5) (1987) but the trial court dismissed the case holding that the statute was facially unconstitutional. Appellant state argued that the controlling law was Ferber which held that child pornography is unprotected by the U.S. Const. amend. I and that states have greater leeway in regulating it than other obscenity or adult pornography. On appeal the court agreed with appellant state holding that Ferber was controlling and finding that the state had a compelling interest in protecting children by eradicating and forbidding possession of child pornography. The court therefore reversed the dismissal of appellee's charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of appellee's charges for child pornography was reversed because the statute under which appellee was charged was not facially unconstitutional because the state had a compelling interest to protect children from the abuses caused in child pornography.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Marion County (Florida), which convicted appellant of violating Fla. Stat. ch. 794.041(2)(b) (1985) by engaging in sexual activity with his stepdaughter, a child under 18 years of age with whom appellant stood in the position of custodial authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, convicted of violating Fla. Stat. ch. 794.041(2)(b) (1985) by engaging in sexual activity with his juvenile stepdaughter, argued trial court error in allowing the victim to testify that, at times not involved in the indictment, appellant made her sleep with other men while he watched, and in allowing appellant's sister to testify that, years earlier when she was 12 years old, appellant had fondled her. The court agreed, noting that ch. 90.403 rendered inadmissible even legally relevant evidence if its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. In allowing the jury to hear about similarly bad acts allegedly committed by appellant, for which he was not charged, the trial court allowed the jury to conclude that appellant not only had a propensity to commit the type of act charged, but likely did so, the court explained. The jury's inclination to so conclude was so strong that the testimony should have been excluded. The stepdaughter's testimony as to sex-related events not charged and the sister's testimony as to her remote and dissimilar sex-related experiences constituted prejudicial evidence of bad character that was inadmissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment convicting appellant of engaging in sexual activity with his juvenile stepdaughter reversed and new trial ordered, because the admission into evidence of testimony by appellant's stepdaughter and his sister that, at times not involved in the indictment, they were sexually victimized by him was unduly prejudicial, as this inadmissible evidence merely demonstrated appellant's propensity to commit the offense for which he was charged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a final judgment from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), which was in favor of appellee oil company in its suit for declaratory and injunctive relief following appellant's denial of appellee's request for a permit to construct a gasoline service station and mini-mart upon a parcel of land within appellant's limits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court agreed with the circuit court that appellant city had acted illegally in denying the permit requested by appellee oil company in 1980. The appellate court determined that not only should the requested construction permit have been issued, but also that appellant had tried to pass subsequent ordinances that would have authorized a denial of the permit application, which evidenced bad faith and an avoidance of duty, such that estoppel was to apply. The appellate court further found that no zoning change was pending at the time of appellee's application that would have prohibited the desired service station on appellee's site, noting that the law at the time of the application was to be applied where there was a finding a bad faith, or unreasonable refusal, or delay in an application. The appellate court affirmed, finding that it was appropriate to have ordered appellant to take appropriate action to approve appellee's site and the plans connected with it, in light of appellant's illegal action in denying the permit application and attempting to block future applications by subsequent ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed the final judgment in favor of appellee oil company in its suit for declaratory and injunctive relief; appellant city's illegal action in denying appellee's permit to construct an approved structure could not be corrected by the subsequent enactment of ordinances blocking the desired use; appellant's bad faith in denying the permit application resulted in the law at the time of the application being applied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with DWI-Manslaughter and the only issue was defendant's intoxication at the time of the accident. Evidence included statement of an eyewitness, a police officer's testimony of defendant's demeanor and failure of a field sobriety test, and evidence of defendant's blood alcohol content. The trial court gave an instruction pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1934(2)(c) (1986) that if defendant had 0.10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in his blood, it was a prima facie case that defendant was under the influence of alcohol. Defendant appealed his conviction and the court agreed that the instruction created an unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable presumption of impairment. However, the court affirmed the conviction because it held that the error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence that defendant was intoxicated. The court found beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found defendant guilty even without the defective jury instruction. The jury instruction would have been permissible if the trial court made clear that the presumption was not mandatory, and that the jury was free to accept or reject the inference based on all the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant's petition and entered a fill-in-the-blank order that held that appellant was not sufficiently mature to give an informed consent. The court made no factual findings. The appellate court reversed the judgment and held that the trial court failed to recite sufficient findings to permit a meaningful appeal. Because the court resolved the case based on a procedural error, it declined to answer the question of whether Fla. Stat. ch. 390.001(4)(a)1 was unconstitutionally vague. The court remanded the case to the trial court with instruction to that court to apply controlling case law announced by another district court, which held that ch. 390.001(4)(a)1 unconstitutionally allowed trial judges to make arbitrary decisions based more upon personal, moral, religious, or political beliefs than upon constitutionally permissible statutory guidelines.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered into a plea agreement to a reduced charge of second degree murder and attempted murder. The trial court, by use of a scoresheet, determined appellant's rating and sentenced him to 22 years in prison, because his offenses included the use of firearms. Two years later, appellant moved to correct his sentence and contended that the trial court used the scoresheet in effect at the time of his sentencing, rather than at the time he committed the aforementioned crimes. The trial court denied appellant's motion, and he appealed. The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence. The court held that harmless error resulted by the trial court's usage of the improper scoresheet, because the result would essentially remain unchanged. The court reasoned that although case law determined that the guidelines by which appellant was sentenced under were unconstitutional, because appellant's sentence was the product of a plea bargain, his sentence could be corrected, however, the state could also opt to retry appellant on the original charges, therefore, the court left the decision with appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a minor, sought review of an order of the Circuit Court for Lake County (Florida), which denied appellant's petition for waiver of parental consent for the termination of her pregnancy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ruled that the judicial alternative to parental consent provided by Fla. Stat. ch. 390.001(4)(a) (1988) failed to provide sufficient safeguards against the possible arbitrary denial of appellant minor's petition for waiver of parental consent to an abortion and, thus, did not safeguard appellant's constitutional right to privacy. Because the judicial alternative was constitutionally infirm, the court held the requirement of parental consent was invalid. Explaining, the court noted that under the Florida consent law, an order waiving parental consent was required if a minor was found sufficiently mature; if not found mature, a determination must be made to determine her best interests. However, the court noted, Florida law did not require a record hearing on the merits of the petition, did not authorize the court to take useful evidence in making its determination, did not specify the subject matter of that evidence, and did not require the minor's appearance before the court, or provide guidelines on maturity, or advise the minor of her rights, or provide her with counsel. Moreover, the determination was to be so expedited that a meaningful hearing could not be held.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order denying appellant minor's petition for waiver of parental consent for aborting her pregnancy was vacated, and cause was remanded to dismiss petition and allow abortion decision to be left to appellant and her physician, because statutory judicial alternative to parental consent for abortion was unconstitutionally vague, as statute provided insufficient safeguards against possible arbitrary denial of appellant's petition for parental waiver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which, in appellant's suit against appellee, rejected appellant's claim that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a personal injury protection insured, sued appellee insurer. The trial court rejected appellant's assertion that Fla. Stat. ch. 627.739(1) (1983) was unconstitutional because it denied appellant's right of access to the courts by barring any tort remedy against a tortfeasor for a personal injury protection deductible without providing a reasonable alternative. The court held that although appellant had standing to raise his claim, that claim could only be brought against a tortfeasor, and not in an action against the insurer. This was true because if appellant's claim was upheld, only the provision under ch. 627.739(1) which eliminated the tort remedy against the tortfeasor for the deductible would be struck down as a denial of an insured's right to the courts, and not the provisions creating the deductible itself. However, because a reasonable alternative was provided by the entire automobile no fault scheme, specifically, prompt payment for a reasonable portion of the damages sustained by an injured party, the provision under ch. 627.739(1) which eliminated the tort remedy against the tortfeasor for the deductible was constitutional. Judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a judgment from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida), which imposed a sentence below the 15-year mandatory minimum required by Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(3) after defendant entered a guilty plea to trafficking and conspiracy to traffic in 400 or more grams of cocaine, because the trial court wanted to impose a sentence commensurate with that of a codefendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered an open guilty plea to the court for trafficking and conspiracy to traffic in 400 grams or more of cocaine. His codefendant had received a sentence below the mandatory minimum, pursuant to a plea agreement. At the time of defendant's plea, the prosecutor stated that if defendant provided substantial assistance before the sentencing hearing, then the state would move for a reduction of the mandatory minimum. It was undisputed that defendant did not provide substantial assistance. Nevertheless, although the statutory minimum under Fla. Stat. ch. 893.135(1)(b)(3) was 15 years, the trial court sentenced defendant to eight years and waived the mandatory fine. The trial court reasoned that it was unfair to sentence defendant more harshly than his co-defendant, who had been his source for drugs. On appeal, the court reversed the sentence and remanded for resentencing because the state acted constitutionally in denying defendant, who failed to provide substantial assistance, the opportunity for a reduced sentencing, while giving it to his codefendant who did provide assistance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence below the mandatory minimum was reversed, and the case remanded for resentencing. The court found that defendant could be sentenced to the mandatory minimum while his codefendant who actually supplied the drugs received a lesser sentence, because the codefendant provided substantial assistance to the state, and defendant did not provide assistance even though he had the chance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant personal representative filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against appellee health care providers.  Fla. Stat. ch. 768.57 (1987) required that all such lawsuits be preceded by the mailing of a notice of intent to sue to the parties to be sued at least 90 days before the suit was filed and that such notice must be sent via certified mail. Appellant's initial notice, although timely, was not sent via certified mail, and his subsequent certified mail notice was untimely. Appellees moved to dismiss. Appellant responded that appellees were estopped to assert the defense, given that they had acknowledged receiving the timely regular mail notice. Although the lower court rejected that argument, concluding that it lacked jurisdiction, that order was reversed on appeal, and the case was remanded. The court on appeal held that the pre-filing notice requirement was not jurisdictional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sheriff was instructed to serve a writ of garnishment to an entity previously ordered to pay funds to appellee bank's judgment debtor. The parties disputed the form of the writ, and the consequent delay resulted in the ungarnished funds being distributed to appellee's debtor. Appellee then sued appellant in the county where appellee bank was located, rather than in appellant's county, seeking a statutory penalty plus recovery of the funds that should have been garnished. Appellant's motion to dismiss on improper venue grounds was denied. The court reversed on appeal, holding that because the primary focus of appellee's lawsuit was to recover from appellant the funds that ought to have been garnished, the proper venue was appellant's county were the untimely service took place, not in appellee's county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to trafficking in cocaine and conspiracy to traffic in cocaine pursuant to a negotiated substantial performance agreement. At the time of entry of the plea, the state requested the trial court to give appellant a 90-day period, prior to imposition of sentence, in which to perform the anticipated substantial assistance. Notwithstanding this request, the trial court scheduled sentencing 37 days after the plea entry. When appellant appeared for sentencing 37 days later, the trial court found that appellant had not rendered the substantial assistance contemplated by the agreement; thus, the court sentenced appellant to two mandatory minimum 15-year concurrent terms of incarceration. On appeal, the court reversed, and remanded appellant's conviction and sentence. The court held that appellant demonstrated good cause and that the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant's request for either a continuance of sentencing or permission to withdraw his plea and proceed to trial. The court reasoned that the state had not shown that it made efforts to accept appellant's assistance within the 37-day time period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the decision of the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) convicting him of felony driving while intoxicated in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1931 and imposing a departure sentence of five years' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of driving while under the influence in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1931 and was given a departure sentence of five years' imprisonment. On appeal, the court found that reversal of the judgment was warranted because the trial court instructed the jury on the presumption of intoxication set forth in Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1934(2)(c). The court held that the instruction offended the requirement of due process by relieving the state of its burden because the instruction created an unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable presumption of impairment. Also, the court held that an investigating officer's testimony regarding appellant's statement to him at the scene was inadmissible because the statement was privileged under Fla. Stat. ch. 316.066(4). Also, the court held that it was improper for the trial court to deny appellant's proffered testimony of a supervisor of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to prove that the department did not consider appellant a habitual offender. The court found such testimony relevant because Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1931 enhanced the penalty for a violation of the statute if a defendant was a habitual traffic offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed appellant's conviction for the offense of felony driving while under the influence and remanded for further proceedings. The court reasoned that the jury instruction was unconstitutional, the testimony of an investigating officer was inadmissible, and appellant's evidence that he was not a habitual offender should have been allowed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of appellee because there was no zoning in progress; thus, the permit should have been granted.

The child was actually living with appellee father for two years when appellee received a notice of child support delinquency from the clerk of courts. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 61.14, the notice ordered appellee to pay the arrearages by a certain date or a delinquency judgment would be entered against him. Appellee filed a declaratory action alleging that chapter 61.14 was unconstitutional because it deprived him of due process rights. The court agreed with appellee because the statute denied appellee access to the court and the opportunity to be heard. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The statute violated the separation of powers principle and Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.540 because it prohibited the court from reviewing or modifying the original child support order. The statute also prevented appellee from challenging the order and presenting evidence of possible defenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed several consolidated appeals wherein the trial court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13 (1987) was constitutional. Appellants were charged by information with the purchase of cocaine in violation of the aforementioned statute. On appeal, they contended that the enacting legislation, known as the Crime Prevention and Control Act (Act), violated the one subject requirement of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6. The court held that the issue was recently addressed by another appellate district, which ruled that the legislation did not violate the one subject requirement because the different targets of the Act were naturally and logically connected, and the appellate court also noted the legislature's prerogative to include a broad range of topics in the Act. The court did, however, remand for correction the trial court's order with respect to one appellant, who contended that the order placing her on probation erroneously reflected a five-year term of probation rather than a three-year term as pronounced by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the circuit court, which declared a cocaine-purchasing statute as constitutional, was affirmed because another appellate district had recently struck down another challenge to the same statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and his wife entered into an agreement with appellees, members of the wife's family. The agreement required appellee siblings to devise their interests in a parcel of land only to their children or to each other. The agreement was an agreement to keep appellees' parents' will in force. After the wife's death, appellees brought an action against appellant that sought specific performance of the agreement to keep the will in force. The lower court ruled that the agreement was a valid and enforceable contract and was specifically enforceable against the wife's estate. The lower court also found that by signing a letter, appellant waived his spousal elective share in the property. The court affirmed the lower court's decision. The court found that the agreement was a valid contract to make a will and that, as a matter of law, a person could make a contract to bind himself to dispose of his property in a particular way by will. The court held that appellant's elective share was based on the assets that remained after deducting all valid claims against the estate. The contractual claim effectively eliminated from the wife's estate any interest in the parcel.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the agreement to keep a will in force gave rise to a valid claim which had to be satisfied prior to determining appellant husband's elective share and that that claim had effectively eliminated from the wife's estate any interest in the parcel of land.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An information was brought against appellees charging them with violating the Florida Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act based on underlying violations of Fla.

The trial court dismissed the information, finding that the RICO Act was unconstitutional and that the combined provisions of the RICO Act and the obscenity statute had an unconstitutional chilling effect on protected speech. The reviewing court reversed and remanded, holding that the obscenity statute was not void for vagueness and that it did not violate the state constitution because it prevented appellees' customers from acquiring obscene materials where the customers had no reasonable expectation of privacy while acquiring the materials.

Stat. ch. 633.521(3) and 633.541(1), as implemented by administrative regulations, because his experience did not include four years of working for someone already certified as a contractor II, or the educational equivalent. The denial was upheld on administrative appeal. Appellant then sought judicial review. In affirming, the court ruled that, pursuant to Fla.

Appellees bought this property. A suit to quiet title was filed, and the lower court entered a judgment in appellees' favor. Appellants sought review, alleging inadequate notice of the impending tax sale. The appellate court affirmed because Fla. Stat. ch. 197.522(1)(a) (1987) provided that the clerk of the circuit court was not required to notify appellants of the tax sale where no address was listed with the tax collector's statement. The tax sale was proper because appellants did not pay the taxes that they knew were due because they received notice of the due taxes. The court ruled that appellants were charged with the duty of ascertaining the amount of current or delinquent taxes and had to pay these taxes before they became delinquent. The payment of taxes was not be excused because of an omission or commission of any act on the part of any property appraiser or tax collector.  Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 12D-13.006(2).</SPAN></P>

The court denied the petition. Petitioner could not be convicted or punished for violating the other county ordinances because those ordinances did not contain any penal provisions. Furthermore, the charging documents did not save the county penal ordinance from the vice of unconstitutional vagueness by particularizing the exact acts with which petitioner was charged. An unconstitutionally vague penal ordinance could not be made constitutional by specific factual allegations in the charging document because it was the penal provision, not the accusations, that prescribed the rule to govern conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, taxpayers, purchased shares of a mutual fund that invested in U.S. government securities. In filing their Florida intangible tax return, appellees included their shares in the mutual fund and paid the amount of tax which was not being contested and paid into the registry of the court an amount attributable to the contested intangible tax for their ownership of shares in the fund. The court held that the statute imposing Florida's intangible tax was unconstitutional as applied to appellees' shares and appellees were entitled to a refund of their taxes. On appeal, the issue was whether 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3124 and Fla. Stat. ch. 199.185(1)(d) (1985), which provided that obligations of the United States government were exempt from taxation, precluded Florida from imposing its intangible tax on the portion of appellees' shares of the fund represented by the fund's holdings in repurchase agreements for federal securities. The court reversed, concluding that the mutual fund was not the true owner of the federal securities under the repurchase agreements and, accordingly, the portion of the shares of the funds attributable to repurchase agreements were not exempt from taxation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the ruling, holding that the exemption did not apply because the mutual fund did not have the risks or rights associated with ownership.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, personal representative of the estate of a deceased sheriff's deputy, sued appellant, a Florida municipal corporation. The jury found appellant liable for a shooting incident in which decedent was struck by a shot fired by a police officer. Appellant specifically pled the defense of comparative negligence, alleging that the decedent failed to exercise due care for his own safety during the incident that led to his injury and subsequent death. Appellant petitioned for review of the final judgment against it awarding appellee $ 600,000 damages. Appellant contended that the damage award should be limited to $ 100,000 under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28 (1987). The court found that the trial court correctly held that ch. 768.28 did not apply because the action was pending when a revision to that statute limiting damage awards took effect. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial on the ground that the trial court erred in directing a verdict against appellant on the issue of comparative negligence. Further, the trial court failed to give appellant's requested jury instruction regarding the justifiable use of force standard found in Fla. Stat. ch. 776.05 (1985).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court, Bay County (Florida), revoking his probation and imposing a sentence that departed from sentencing guideline recommendations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was placed on probation after a conviction for selling cannabis. Two years later, defendant was convicted of cocaine possession, which resulted in the revocation of probation on the prior charge and the imposition of a sentence with more than a one-cell departure from the guidelines recommendation. The trial court imposed a sentence in excess of the guidelines because the defendant committed a similar criminal offense while on probation. The sentence included time in jail and public service. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment because the second offense was similar to the one for which defendant was serving the probation and was a clear and convincing reason for departure. The court also considered for the first time on appeal, and found without merit, defendant's constitutional challenges to the facial validity of the sentencing guidelines. The court reasoned that the maximum community service that could be imposed was limited to the period of probation, so that it was specious to argue that the provisions of Fla. Stat. chs. 775.091, 948.031, were without limitation and, therefore, violated due process or constituted cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A judgment of conviction and a sentence that revoked probation and imposed a sentence in excess of the guidelines were affirmed. The second offense was so similar to the first that it was a clear and convincing reason for departure, and because neither the statute providing for public service nor the condition of probation was without time limits, they could survive constitutional challenges to their facial validity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After plaintiffs were acquitted of criminal charges stemming from a disturbance, they commenced a civil suit against defendant city alleging malicious prosecution, false arrest, and violation of their civil rights. The trial court dismissed the malicious prosecution claims, which were founded on allegations of malice on the part of city police officers, and a final judgment was subsequently entered in favor of defendant. Plaintiffs appealed, arguing that the waiver of sovereign immunity statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(9)(a), was unconstitutional in that it shielded defendant from liability for malicious prosecution. In affirming the final judgment, the appellate court concluded that the constitutionality of the statute had previously been upheld by prior case law. Further, the statute did not abolish causes of action but reasonably arranged and restricted the classes of potential defendants based on the nature of the claims as part of an overall statutory scheme. Plaintiffs' claim that the statute denied them equal protection lacked merit, for the state legislature had the discretion to place limits and conditions upon the scope of the sovereign immunity waiver.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a non-resident of the state who was not covered by PIP insurance, was struck by a motorist who had PIP insurance coverage with defendant insurance company. He instituted suit against defendant seeking to collect PIP coverage benefits. The trial court entered judgment in favor of defendant after concluding that plaintiff was not entitled to collect such benefits from the motorist's insurer under Fla. Stat. ch. 627.736(4)(d)(4). Plaintiff appealed, arguing that the statute was unconstitutional because it left him without a viable remedy for the injuries he sustained. In affirming, the appellate court concluded that plaintiff's argument lacked merit. Plaintiff had the ability to institute suit and collect damages for negligence against the motorist without being required to meet a no-fault threshold. The statute could not be found unconstitutional as a denial of due process or equal protection, as it inflicted no constitutional harm upon plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that ch. 914.22(1)(a) and (3) (1985) were unconstitutional in this case, and dismissed the information. On appeal, the court held that because Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged their convictions in the trial court on the charge that they violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (RICO), Fla. Stat. chs. 895.01 - .06 (1985), on the basis that RICO violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States and Florida Constitutions by delegating discretion to a prosecutor to pursue either a gambling misdemeanor or a felony RICO charge, and that RICO imposed cruel and unusual punishment in violation of U.S. Const. amend. VIII. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and found that there was no violation of defendants' equal protection rights. The court held that RICO did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because RICO did not impose an enhanced sentence for conviction of the predicate misdemeanor offenses. The court found that violation of RICO was a separate offense, and punishment for violation of RICO was for participation in an on-going criminal enterprise, which was a distinct and separate crime from the predicate offenses.

Stat. ch. 228.091(2) (1987). Appellant contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 228.091(2) (1987) was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to specify a limitations period for the school official's order to a trespasser to leave the school campus and it failed to define the meaning of &quot;legitimate business on the campus.&quot; The court stated that the fact that the statute set no time limit on a school official's authority to otherwise lawfully order a person off a public school campus was of no moment as a public school official was entitled to bar indefinitely non-authorized persons from being on the campus. The court also stated that the statutory phrase &quot;legitimate business on the campus,&quot; was sufficiently definite for constitutional purposes and meant that one who entered or remained on a school campus must have lacked any purpose for being there which was connected with the operation of the school. The court stated that it was unable to have reviewed whether the statute was unconstitutionally applied under the facts because the issue was never raised below. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Appellee sued appellant for negligence. In a prior appeal of the same order, the court had affirmed the trial court's order that denied appellant's motion to change venue. Appellant asserted that an intervening state supreme court decision, interpreting Fla.

While the court agreed that the intervening decision by the supreme court would require a reversal of the order that denied the motion to change venue, the court elected to follow the law of the case and affirm its earlier decision. The court explained that, although the intervening decision could constitute the exceptional circumstance necessary to modify the law of the case, the court declined to do so in the absence of a showing of manifest injustice.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. III, &sect; 6. Appellant State of Florida challenged the ruling, and the court held that the statute was not vague or overboard, as it fairly gave appellees notice of criminal wrongdoing. The court also determined that the statute did not violate the single subject rule, as the entire statute concerned criminal law, and methods to reduce crime. In addition, the court stated that appellant did not have to prove appellees knew they were within 1000 feet of a school, and stated that appellees were not legally entrapped. Finally, the court concluded that that the statute was not cruel and unusual, nor an abuse of police power.

The trial court set aside the jury verdict for appellants, entered judgment for appellees, and ruled that appellees were entitled to a set-off because appellants had settled their design negligence claim against other defendants prior to trial. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that appellant city could not be held liable under &sect; 1983 for appellee official's actions, because the South Florida Building Code provided that his decisions were subject to review by the Board of Rules and Appeals, and thus he did not have final policymaking authority. Also, appellee city had no policy of sanctioning appellee official's misconduct.

App. P. 9.331, the court ordered rehearing en banc of a criminal appeal from the Circuit Court for Madison County (Florida) to reconsider the decision in the panel opinion that Fla. Stat. ch. 921.08(5) (1987), as amended by Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered rehearing of a criminal appeal en banc to reconsider whether Fla. Stat. ch. 921.08(5) (1987) was retroactively applicable and required affirmance of sentence. The amendment to the statute purported to change the standard of proof applicable to facts supporting departure from &quot;credible and proven beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; to a preponderance of the evidence standard. The amendment also substantially altered the rule of appellate review in directing appellate courts to uphold a departure sentence as long as at least one reason for departure was found to be valid. The court found that by changing the standard for evidentiary proof and lessening the appellate review standard, appellant was significantly disadvantaged with respect to length and imposition of a departure sentence. In order to avoid violating the ex post facto prohibition, the court applied the previous standard in reversing appellant's sentence. The court was unable to conclude that the state had met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the sentence would have been the same without the impermissible reasons for departure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant took part in offenses arising out of an armed home invasion which resulted in the death of one of the occupants. He was convicted of the offenses. On appeal, appellant contended that his convictions were obtained through the admission, over his objection, of a highly incriminating cloth ski mask which, he contended, had been illegally seized from his apartment. The officer who conducted the search had, before the offenses, reason to believe that appellant was a drug dealer. The officer then initiated a controlled drug buy, after which he conducted a search of appellant's apartment and discovered the evidence. The court determined that, although the drug search was a subterfuge, the current applicable standard used to determine the validity of a search was without regard to the good faith or bad faith or the underlying intent of the officers involved. As it was irrelevant that the officer intended to search for evidence of the murder and robbery while his colleagues searched for narcotics, the search and seizure were lawful. Appellant's convictions were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

A circuit court agreed with him and granted him final summary judgment. On appeal, a state appellate court affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner former husband filed for writ of certiorari, seeking to challenge a post-dissolution order of the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) which, by application of local administrative order, deferred judicial consideration of his motions for contempt and a visitation schedule, pending family mediation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court entered a final judgment of dissolution of marriage which awarded respondent wife custody of the parties' three children and gave petitioner husband reasonable visitation rights. Petitioner later filed a motion for contempt, alleging that respondent prevented him from having visitation with his son because she did not like a settlement offer proposed by him in post-judgment support modification proceedings. He also filed a motion to establish a visitation schedule. The trial court entered an order staying proceedings on both motions until compliance with two administrative orders requiring family mediation. Petitioner then sought certiorari review of that order. The court denied the petition, finding that the trial court's order was within the jurisdiction and authority provided under applicable court rules because both motions involved petitioner's visitation rights and the rules provided for family mediation under such circumstances. The order did not violate petitioner's constitutional right to access to the courts because he would only suffer a temporary delay of court proceedings in the interest of a mediated settlement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for writ of certiorari was denied because the trial court properly stayed proceedings on petitioner's motions for contempt and a visitation schedule, pending family mediation pursuant to administrative orders. The court found that the trial court had jurisdiction to order the stay and that petitioner's constitutional right to access to the courts was not violated because he would suffer only a temporary delay of court proceedings.</SPAN></P>

A search of appellee revealed cocaine and drug paraphernalia. Appellee filed a motion to suppress the evidence, alleging unreasonable search and seizure. The trial court granted the motion, and appellant challenged. The court on appeal reversed the trial court's conclusion that the city ordinance prohibiting disorderly conduct, Miami, Fla. Code &sect; 37-17(11), was facially unconstitutional and violative of Fla. Stat. ch. 856.011. The ordinance was narrowly drawn, and the language was plain and described with particularity the conduct to be avoided. In addition, the substance of the ordinance bore a rational relationship to the goal of preventing public disorder and was a reasonable and valid exercise of the police power. Therefore, the ordinance was constitutional, and the motion to suppress was improperly granted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipality appealed from the Circuit Court for Monroe County (Florida), which held unconstitutional appellant's assessment of developmental impact fees upon appellee developers of a condominium apartment building.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant municipality issued an assessment of developmental impact fees upon appellee developers. The trial court held that the fees violated appellees' constitutionally protected rights, and appellant sought review. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the fees did not offend the rights of appellees, even though the fees were assessed after a building permit had been issued and after appellees had sold a substantial number of the building units. The court disagreed with appellees' argument that an impact fee was constitutional only when the developer was given the opportunity to pass the fee on to new residents. In the court's view, the term &quot;user&quot; encompassed anyone who might derive benefit from the services, which included a developer seeking to sell condominium units. The court rejected appellees' argument that the doctrine of vested rights, which protected property owners and builders who relied on an act or omission by the government, protected them from the impact fees. A building permit provided no assurance to the possessor that a taxing authority would not increase taxes on the property being built upon, or impose fees for municipal services.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment that appellant municipality's impact fee violated the constitutional rights of appellee developers was reversed and remanded.

When the line was extended to impose the CCCL on appellants' property, appellants filed a complaint for declaratory judgment alleging the Department lacked jurisdiction or in the alternative to declare the CCCL to be improperly imposed and to quiet title. The circuit court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction because appellants had not exhausted their administrative remedies. The court held that the question was one of judicial policy, not of jurisdiction. The court had the power to adjudicate, but counseled abstention and placing claims within the special competence of the administrative body. It also ruled that the CCCL was not a cloud on appellants' title. The remedy for this type of property use limitation was to challenge the rule, with review of the resulting determination by the appellate courts. The court concluded the Department should be allowed to make the initial decision regarding the merits of the jurisdictional issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants mother and father sought review of the order of appellee Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services directing appellants to pay over $ 2,000 for the cost of maintaining and incarcerating their minor child, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 402.33 (1985), following his adjudication as a juvenile delinquent for burglarizing appellants' own home.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the home of appellants mother and father was burglarized by their minor son, he was adjudicated a juvenile delinquent and committed to the custody of appellee department. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 402.33 (1985), appellee subsequently assessed appellants over $ 2,000 as reimbursement for the costs of maintaining and incarcerating their child. When appellants' request for a fee waiver was denied, appellee did not inform them of the time limitations on requesting an administrative appeal hearing. Appellee issued a final order for payment when appellants failed to request an administrative appeal within 30 days, so appellants sought judicial review. In reversing, the court ruled that, although appellants could be constitutionally required to pay for their son's maintenance and support and Fla. Stat. ch. 39.11 (1985) did not preempt ch. 402.33, it was a violation of appellants' equal protection rights to require them to pay for their son's incarceration because such detention served the public interest; thus, the burden of payment fell on all of society. Moreover, appellants were wrongfully deprived of proper notice of their administrative appeal rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order requiring appellants to pay for their son's incarceration and maintenance was reversed and the case was remanded for an administrative hearing because, inter alia, appellee failed to provide full notice to appellants of their administrative appeal rights and, although appellants could be ordered to pay for their son's support, requiring them to pay for their son's incarceration violated their equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order denying his petition for extraordinary relief from the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), arguing that Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on the sentencing court's objection, appellee Parole and Probation Commission (Florida) extended appellant's presumptive parole release date.

The trial court entered an order denying the petition for extraordinary relief and concluding that the challenged statutes were constitutional. The court affirmed the order, finding no violation of ch. 947 in appellee's action and that the statutes did not unconstitutionally invade the separation of powers clause. The statutes did not invade the separation of powers clause by returning jurisdiction to the sentencing court to approve or disprove a presumptive parole release date by appellee. Instead, the challenged statutes allowed but did not require appellee to extend the presumptive parole release date where there was a judicial objection to parole release. Thus, the ultimate parole decision remained within the discretion of appellee guided by its rules.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent attorney represented an indigent criminal defendant and subsequently sought an award of attorney fees in excess of the hourly rate established in the judicial circuit. Respondent argued that the state law allowing for the limitation of attorney fee awards was unconstitutional as applied to the limit imposed in the case at issue. The court acknowledged that, although facially valid, the maximum fees established by the statute were unconstitutional when applied to extraordinary and unusual cases in such a manner as to curtail the judiciary's inherent power to ensure a defendant's adequate representation. However, the court held that statute was not invalid as applied to the case at bar. The court held that respondent did not establish that the attorney fee applicable to the case at issue served to deprive the indigent criminal defendant of adequate representation, which was requisite to a determination that the fee limit was unconstitutionally low. The court also held that the statute's failure to list objective criteria to assist in establishing fee limits did not render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state attorney, acting as an individual grand jury, applied for a subpoena that commanded petitioner to appear and testify in behalf of the state, in a pending and undetermined matter, and provide standards of his fingerprints. The trial court enforced the subpoena and petitioner sought a writ of certiorari, complaining that the subpoena calling for him to provide standards of his fingerprints without probable cause, was beyond the state attorney's statutory authority, and was unconstitutional. The court held that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.220(b)(1), which involved discovery after filing an indictment, did not limit the state attorney's statutory power of investigation. The court held that the state attorney, when acting as a one-person grand jury, was empowered to summon an individual to produce physical evidence such as fingerprints. The court also held that neither petitioner's privilege against compulsory self-incrimination nor his rights under the Fourth Amendment prevented the state from compelling the taking of his fingerprints.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee inmate was serving a life sentence for murder. Appellee's initial presumptive parole release date (PPRD) was aggravated because of other convictions and actions of appellee. The PPRD was reduced several times for exemplary behavior, and appellee was being considered for an effective parole release date (EPRD). Following a request by appellant commission for his views pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 947.1745(4) (1986), the sentencing judge objected, but provided no explanation. Relying on the letter, appellant extended inmate's PPRD. The trial court found that appellant's reliance on the judge's unexplained opinion was arbitrary and capricious. On appeal from the order directing appellant to reinstate appellee's PPRD, the court reversed. Nothing in Fla. Stat. ch. 947 (1986) required appellant to provide an explanation of an extension based on a sentencing court's objection. Although appellant's decision was within its discretionary powers, it was required to comply with constitutional requirements. The case was remanded with directions to consider the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 947.1745(4) (1986).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City of North Miami enacted an ordinance regulating the ownership of pit bull dogs. Appellees were charged with violating the ordinance and moved to dismiss the charges, contending that the ordinance violated equal protection and due process rights and was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court granted the motion holding that the ordinance was overbroad, vague, and irrational. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded rejecting appellee's claims. First, the court held that equal protection did not guarantee that all dog owners would be treated alike, only that all pit bull owners would be similarly treated. Furthermore, the ordinance was reasonably related to its goal of protecting the city's residents. Second, the ordinance's requirement that pit bull owners obtain insurance did not violate the owner's constitutional right to due process because dogs were subject to the police power of the state for the necessary protection of its citizens. Finally, appellee's vagueness claim had no merit because the ordinance made clear what dogs were considered to be pit bulls and the standards referred to in the ordinance were adequate for owners to assess whether they owned such a dog.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) that convicted him of possession of cocaine, asserting that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to suppress because he did not consent to the search and the police did not have probable cause to arrest him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officers observed people under a tree in a known drug dealing area. As the officers approached, appellant stood up and a pack of crack cocaine fell out of the tree. Appellant was taken to the police station. Appellant was searched. During the search, the officer found a piece of crack in appellant's pocket. Appellant was charged with possession of crack. The trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress. The court reversed because the test to determine probable cause to arrest was whether the facts and circumstances within the officer's knowledge before the search were sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that an offense had been committed by the accused. To support a finding of probable cause based on constructive possession theory, the state was required to prove that the officer had a reasonable belief that the accused had dominion and control over the contraband. The court found no probable cause existed to arrest appellant because there was no reasonable belief the drugs found near the tree belonged to appellant. Because of the coercive setting, appellant did not consent to the search, and the motion to suppress should have been granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the lower court that denied appellant's motion to suppress was reversed because the state failed to prove the police officer had probable cause to arrest based on the facts and circumstances within the officer's knowledge before the search to believe appellant committed a crime. Because the state failed to prove probable cause existed to arrest appellant, the search that revealed additional drugs was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a judgment that denied appellant's petition to avoid a charitable devise. The court concluded that the trial court erred in holding Fla. Stat. ch. 732.803 (1985) unconstitutional under the federal and state equal protection clauses. The court found that the statute, that protected surviving spouses and lineal descendents from improvident charitable bequests, was rationally related to its purpose. The court distinguished the statute from statutes that had been held unconstitutional in other states. The court noted that the Florida statute had a savings clause, Fla. Stat. ch.732.803(1)(e), that allowed charitable bequests to stand when a similar devise was contained in a preceding will, and that the Florida statute did not automatically void the bequest, but made it voidable by descendants only if avoidance would inure to their benefit.

Stat. ch. 463.0055 (1986 Supp.) unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's ruling which dismissed appellants' amended complaint in favor appellee board of optometry and related individuals. The court ruled that the complaint failed to state a justiciable controversy and therefore the trial court lacked jurisdiction under Fla. Stat. ch. 86.021 (1985). The allegations in the dismissed complaint did not refer to any facts that showed an actual rather than a theoretical dispute. The allegations alleged what might occur instead of what had occurred, which would have demonstrated an actual controversy. The court also concluded that in the interest of justice, appellants should be given at least one more opportunity to allege an actual controversy.

Stat. ch. 120.57(1) hearing with respect to every optometrist's application. Appellee denied the petition and the hearing request. On judicial review, the court affirmed, holding that appellants lacked standing to demand a ch. 120.57(1) hearing, because they failed to show that, beyond a potential economic impact on their practice, their substantial interests would be injuriously affected by the licensing of optometrists to administer or prescribe topical ocular drugs. The court also held that appellants could not assert that optometrists should not be certified to administer or prescribe drugs, because the legislature expressly authorized that power in Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city designated an area as a community redevelopment area and created appellee agency to carry out the redevelopment plan. Appellant developer was selected as master developer. Appellant and appellee agency executed a planning and development agreement, but appellee city never signed the agreement. Initially, appellee city approved by resolution a conceptual plan prepared pursuant to the agreement. Subsequently, appellee city adopted a resolution that revoked its prior approval of the plan. Appellant sued appellee city and appellee agency, asking the trial court to declare that appellee city's resolution revoking its approval of the plan was invalid. Appellant also asserted claims for breach of contract and tortious interference with a contract. The trial court granted appellees' motions to dismiss because the agreement specifically gave appellee city the right to refuse to execute the agreement, and did not give appellant any vested property rights. Although appellant maintained on appeal that the agreement was extraneous to its cause of action, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the agreement authorized appellee city to terminate the plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted and sentenced on 29 counts, including racketeering, manufacturing, transporting and selling obscene materials, lewd and lascivious assaults, and sexual activity with children. On appeal, defendant challenged the denial of his motion at the sentencing hearing for recusal of the trial judge and asserted that Fla. Stat. ch. 847.001(7), the codification of the definition of the term &quot;obscene,&quot; was unconstitutional because it was vague and failed to set forth the proper standard for its application. The court reversed the denial of defendant's motion for recusal and remanded for resentencing by a different judge because the judge violated Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.23(d). However, the court found no merit to defendant's constitutional challenge. The statute defined &quot;obscene&quot; exactly as the United States Supreme Court had defined it. The court declined to find the highest court's definition vague. The jury was specifically instructed by the judge to apply the community standards test when evaluating Fla. Stat. ch.  847.001(7)(a) and Fla. Stat. ch. 847.001(7)(b), and to apply the reasonable person test when evaluating Fla. Stat. ch. 847.001(7)(c).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court declared Fla. Stat. ch. 207.004(5)(d)&nbsp;unconstitutional as an unlawful burden on interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3. Appellant department of revenue sought review of the judgment declaring the retaliatory tax statute unconstitutional. The statute imposed retaliatory taxes and fees solely on motor carriers whose vehicles were registered in certain states other than Florida. It was designed to retaliate against &quot;third-structure taxes.&quot; The appellate court held that Florida could not impose a tax, which discriminated against interstate commerce, and that because Fla. Stat. ch. 207.004(5)(d) levied on certain foreign-registered trucks taxes that Florida did not assess against Florida-registered trucks, Florida's retaliatory tax statute could not more directly violate the Commerce Clause. Appellant's argument that the purpose of the statute was to discourage any state from imposing discriminatory taxes or other burdens on out-of-state companies was not legitimate. Neither was the argument that the statute secured reciprocity by inducing other states not to impose third-structure taxes on Florida-registered vehicles.</SPAN></P>

Appellant failed to stop his vehicle when directed to do so by police officers at an illegal driver's license check. Appellee state conceded that the license checkpoint did not meet the standard for constitutional road blocks. The officers pursued and stopped appellant. He was then arrested for driving under the influence, and a search incidental to his arrest revealed cocaine. Appellant was charged with possession of that drug and with fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1935 (1985). After his motion to suppress on the basis of an invalid stop was denied, he pled nolo contendere and reserved the right to raise the issue on appeal. The appellate court determined that appellant's stop for fleeing a police officer was valid because the statute did not require lawfulness of the police action as an element of the offense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order from appellee, the Department of Business Regulation, Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, which denied appellant manufacturer's application for special excise tax classification under Fla. Stat. ch. 564.06 (1985). Appellant sought special excise tax classification for several distilled spirit products manufactured from citrus fruit and sugar cane in Florida and bottled in Indiana. The special excise tax classification was denied by appellee because Indiana was determined to have provided economic incentives to alcoholic beverages manufactured within Indiana and to have enacted discriminatory taxes favoring Indiana-produced beverages in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 564.06(9)(a) and 564.06(9)(b) (1985). Appellant claimed that the special excise tax scheme was unconstitutional as applied and that it should not be penalized because it never took advantage of economic incentives available to small Indiana wineries. The court concluded that appellee's interpretation of the statute was reasonable. The plain language of the statute did not provide that special tax status must be denied only if a taxpayer availed itself of an out-of-state tax advantage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, armed robbery, and burglary, and he sought review, claiming that certain evidence was unconstitutionally taken from his person. The reviewing court concluded that the evidence at issue was the product of a lawful search and seizure and, therefore, affirmed the judgment below. The totality of the evidence was such that there was no question of its sufficiency to support the convictions. The court found that the police had made no more than a Terry stop of defendant, which was properly based upon a founded suspicion of criminal activity arising from his proximity to the drugs and paraphernalia contained in the crack house. The disputed evidence was validly discovered in a search for identification as an appropriate aspect of the Terry stop. Accordingly, the court upheld the search and seizure. Defendant's presence in proximity to the contraband would have justified a full-scale search of his person under the warrant. The circumstances were more than sufficient to meet the markedly reduced standard of founded suspicion. The officer's retrieval and inspection of defendant's wallet did not go beyond the permissible limited scope.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence in the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), for manslaughter while driving under the influence of alcohol, in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(3)(a), (b), (c)3 (1986). He argued that the jury instruction based on Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1934(2) violated his right to due process. He also argued that his sentence violated sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a high speed accident in the course of a police chase on city streets. A passenger in another car was killed. Defendant was charged with violating Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(a), (b), (c)3 (1986). At trial, there was extensive evidence of defendant's condition as to alcohol. The jury was instructed as to a presumption of impairment pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1934(2). Defendant argued that the instruction was unconstitutional because it constituted a mandatory presumption requiring a finding or it was a mandatory rebuttable presumption requiring defendant to persuade the jury of a contrary result. On appeal, the court reviewed a United States Supreme Court case and other cases which provided support for defendant's argument. The court held that the jury instruction did constitute a mandatory rebuttable presumption in violation of defendant's right to due process. However, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, because, based on the facts of the case, the error was harmless. Defendant also challenged his sentence, but the court affirmed, holding that the sentence had not departed from the sentencing guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the jury instruction did constitute a mandatory rebuttable presumption and therefore violated defendant's right to due process. However, the court certified the question to the Florida Supreme Court. The court held that, based on the facts of the case, the error was harmless, and the court affirmed the conviction. The court also affirmed the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital challenged an order of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida) which found that 1980 Fla. Laws ch. 80-510 was unconstitutional on the ground that its primary purpose was to limit liability under sovereign immunity, and which awarded damages to appellee patient's guardian.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee patient's guardian brought suit against appellant hospital for injuries suffered by patient. Appellant admitted liability and agreed that patient incurred $ 2,500,000 in damages because of appellant's negligence. However, appellant asserted that its liability was limited to just $ 50,000 pursuant to Fla. Stat.ch. 768.28(5) (1980), which partially waived sovereign immunity of governmental agencies. Appellant pointed out that a hospital district created by special act of legislature was a governmental entity for purposes of Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(5) (1980). Since 1980 Fla. Laws ch. 80-510 created a new hospital district which included appellant, it had sovereign immunity. The trial court found 1980 Fla. Laws ch. 80-510 unconstitutional and awarded appellee the full amount of damages. On appeal, the court found that 1980 Fla. Laws ch. 80-510 was constitutional, because its primary purpose was to restructure appellant. However, the court upheld the award. It found that appellant had waived its sovereign immunity by creating a trust fund for malpractice claims. The court amended the trial court's order to allow execution to issue only against the proceeds of that trust fund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed that part of the judgment awarding damages to the appellee, guardian of patient, but amended the trial court's order to allow execution to issue only against the proceeds of the appellant hospital and welfare board medical malpractice self-insurance trust fund. The court found that appellant hospital waived its sovereign immunity and that the law which restructured the hospital was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a married couple, purchased an automobile insurance policy provided by defendant insurer.

Defendant insurer moved for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiffs willingly signed the form and rejected the uninsured motorist coverage. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal by plaintiffs, the court held that the presumption of informed and knowing rejection could not be rebutted by testimony that plaintiffs did not read the form. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juvenile was charged with being delinquent by having committed grand theft of an automobile. He unsuccessfully sought to suppress his custodial statement to the police, after which he was adjudicated delinquent and placed on juvenile probation. On appeal, his delinquency adjudication was reversed, and his case was remanded for a new hearing excluding his custodial statement. The court held that the evidence against him, consisting of his riding in a car he knew was stolen, was sufficient for a conviction under the terms of the grand theft statute, notwithstanding appellant's lack of intent to exercise dominion or control over the vehicle. Expressing uncertainty about precedent, however, the court certified that question to the state supreme court. On the subject of appellant's confession, the court held without reservation that the police failure to stop questioning appellant after he requested counsel mandated suppression of the resulting statement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee son was injured in an automobile accident with insured. Appellees, father and son, brought a negligence action against insured within the statute of limitations period, Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(3)(a)(1975). Over seven years later, a third amended complaint was filed joining appellant insurer. A default judgment was entered against the insured, the cause proceeded to trial on the issue of insurance coverage and damages, and judgment was entered in appellees' favor. Appellant sought reversal, arguing that the statute of limitations had expired before appellant was joined in the action because the limitations period began to run the date of the accident as appellant could have been joined anytime thereafter as the real party in interest. The court affirmed. The court held that appellant's liability was entirely derivative as to indemnifying insured when a judgment was rendered against him; therefore, the statute of limitations had not run against appellant.</SPAN></P>

The complaint alleged that appellees directly solicited consumers within the forum state through the mail and offered, for a fee, to assist these recipients in purchasing lottery tickets or &quot;shares&quot; in those tickets. Appellees, it was alleged, would also assist in the disbursement of any winnings. Appellant alleged a violation of gambling laws and laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices, under both Fla. Stat. ch.  849.09(1) (1985) and Fla. Stat. ch. 501.204(1) (1985). The trial court found Fla. Stat. ch. 849.09 et seq. (1985) unconstitutional as violative of the federal constitution's commerce clause. On appeal, the court reversed that decision. The two criminal statutes allegedly involved here did not unconstitutionally affect the federal commerce clause.

Appellant county property appraiser challenged the judgment. The test for substantial completion under Fla. Stat. ch. 192.042(1) (1985) was similar to that under Fla. Stat. ch. 193.071(4). If a building could have been put to the use for which it was intended, although lacking some minor items, it could have been deemed substantially complete for tax purposes. Actual occupancy was not the appropriate test, particularly where shell buildings were involved. The buildings were substantially completed on January 1, 1986, to the point appellee intended. They were shells, waiting to be finished. The appellate court reversed. Appellant's determination that the buildings were substantially complete was presumptively correct. Appellee failed to adduce sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that appellant had made a legal assessment. Further, the concept of &quot;substantial completion&quot; should have been given a liberal interpretation.</SPAN></P>
