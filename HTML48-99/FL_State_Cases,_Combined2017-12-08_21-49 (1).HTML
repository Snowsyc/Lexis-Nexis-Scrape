</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a departure sentence reimposed by the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) after remand for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's case was remanded for resentencing and the trial court entered a departure sentence, articulating eight reasons for departure. The court affirmed the departure sentence because, even though seven of the articulated reasons were invalid, only one valid reason was necessary for departure under the amendment to the sentencing guidelines provided in Fla. Stat. ch. 921.001(5) (1987). Although Fla. Stat. ch. 921.001(5) (1987) was effective after the date the crimes were committed, the court held that that there was no ex post facto problem. The court found that the effect of the changes to the statute was procedural in nature, and did not affect matters of substance, even though the law acted to defendant's detriment. The court further certified conflict and certified to the supreme court the question of whether Fla. Stat. ch. 921.001(5) (1987) was applicable to appellate review of sentences imposed for offenses committed prior to its effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's departure sentence because there was at least one valid reason for departure articulated by the trial court. The court certified conflict and joined other districts in certifying to the supreme court the question of whether the statute requiring only one valid reason for departure was applicable to appellate review of sentences imposed for offenses committed prior to the effective date of the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, property owners, their homeowner's association and individual lot owners, challenged a decision of the Circuit Court for Orange County, (Florida) for appellee city in their declaratory action contesting certain municipal ordinances. The issue on appeal centered around the application of city zoning ordinances by appellee city on a mobile home park which appellants sought to convert from a rental park into a condominium.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the property owner, their homeowner's association, and individual lot owners, filed a petition for declaratory judgment against the appellee city seeking to declare certain municipal ordinances unconstitutional, illegal and in conflict with superior state statutes. The trial court held for appellee city granting injunctive relief and divestiture of title. Appellants contested arguing that city ordinances on the subject property were preempted by the state condominium statutes, that the city ordinances had no relation to the public health or welfare, and that appellee city was equitably estopped from applying the ordinances, and sought review. The court reversed and remanded for imposition of a proper alternative for non-compliance with the plat requirement. The court had concluded the trial court remedy was improper because it imposed an unreasonable and unconstitutional restraint on the right to alienate property and was without any relation to the public health and safety. The court also stated that appellee was unable to order divestiture based on a failure to record a plat where it lacked authority to prevent the sale of the land in dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded for the lower court to impose a proper alternative for non-compliance with the plat requirement. The court concluded that the trial court remedy invoked was improper because it imposed an unreasonable and unconstitutional restraint on the right to alienate property and was without any relation to the public health and safety, thus a divestiture of the land based on a failure to record a plat was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant cities challenged an order finding Fla. Laws ch. 86-41 and Fla. Laws ch. 86-42, amending Fla.

II, &sect; 5(a) precluded city officials from serving on the Boards of Trustees of the Police and firefighter pension trust funds. On appeal, the court affirmed that portion of the order finding the statutory amendments constitutional. The court held that the voluntary nature of the program rendered it facially constitutional. The court reversed that portion of the order finding that both the amended statutes and the Florida Constitution precluded municipal officials from serving on the Boards of the police and firefighter pension trust funds. The court held that the legislative history of both amendments indicated that the legislature intended to allow city officials to serve on such Boards. The court held that there was nothing inherently inconsistent or incompatible in service by municipal officials on these Boards so as to say that it presumptively violates the prohibition against dual officeholding in &sect; 5(a).</SPAN></P>

After a remand from the State of Florida Supreme Court, petitioner state sought a writ of certiorari and filed a motion with the court to reinstate a part of its previous opinion which concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion and departed from essential requirements of law when it approved respondent's submission of the written questionnaire to prospective jurors. The court granted petitioner's motion and held that the questions improperly went far beyond the normal questions ordinarily asked during voir dire. The court therefore quashed the order granting respondent's motion to submit the questionnaire.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, accident victims, were injured in 1982, when a traffic signal manufactured by appellee manufacturer and delivered to appellee city in 1971, allegedly malfunctioned. Appellants filed a product liability action in 1986. The trial court granted appellee manufacturer's motion for summary judgment based on a 12 years' statute of repose. The court reversed because appellants had relied to their detriment on a recent court decision that abolished the repose statute and filed their suit after the repose statute had expired, but within the normal four years' limitations period. Appellants otherwise could have complied with the repose statute because more than one year of the statutory repose period remained from the date of the accident within which to file suit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation challenged an order of appellee, State Department of Transportation (Florida), which revoked appellants road connection permit, required it to submit a proposed redesign of the connection, and provided that if appellant failed to submit an acceptable redesign, appellant's property would be subjected to a redesign which would include a 250-foot drive leading to the connection to be used by appellant and adjoining landowners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation contested an order of appellee transportation department. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings. The court affirmed that portion of appellee's order revoking appellant's permit. The court held that appellee had the authority to revoke appellants permit, under Fla. Stat. ch. 335.18(3) (1985), due to appellant's failure to construct the connection in accordance with the permit. The court also affirmed that portion of the order requiring appellee to submit a redesign of the connection. The court held that appellee had the authority to require the submission of a redesign, under chapter 335.18(1) and 335.18(3), because the evidence supported the need for a major redesign of its connection due to the heavy amount of traffic entering and exiting the connection during peak periods. The court reversed that portion of the order requiring appellant to construct a drive on its property for use of abutting landowners. The court held that such an order was an unconstitutional taking of property as there was no evidence that the condition furthered a public purpose related to the permit requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner board of county commissioners sought certiorari review of an order by respondent circuit court judge (Florida), which required the county to pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs for an indigent defendant's motion for post-conviction relief as required by Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner Brevard County Board of Commissioners' a writ of certiorari against respondent circuit court judge. Respondent had issued an order requiring petitioner to pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs for an indigent defendant's motion for post-conviction relief pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 43.28 required the county to pay for the attorney because he was personnel necessary to conduct the daily business of the court. The court determined that although the appointment of counsel for a post-conviction collateral proceeding was a discretionary matter, turning on the issues of the adversary nature of the proceeding, its complexity, the need for an evidentiary hearing, and the need for substantial legal research, any doubts must be resolved in favor of an indigent defendant. These due process requirements, according to the court, stem from the U.S. Const. amend V and Fla. Const. art. I, sec. 9.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant descendants sought to invalidate changes decedent made to his inter vivos trust, claiming that the mortmain statute allowed them to avoid the charitable bequests. Less then six months before his death, decedent changed the beneficiary of his inter vivos trust from his grandchildren to several charities. Appellee personal representative of decedent opposed, claiming that the mortmain statute was not applicable. The court affirmed the trial court and held that Florida's mortmain statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 732.803 (1985), was not applicable to an inter vivos trust through which decedent made gifts to charities. The court found that the plain meaning of the mortmain statute made it applicable only to wills, and not trusts.  Fla. Stat. ch. 689.075 made inter vivos trusts a legitimate way of reducing assets that were subject to probate administration, and allowed for eleventh hour provisions for the transfer of property to charity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant convicted of grand theft challenged a decision of the Circuit Court for Orange County (Florida) to sentence him to two years in prison, or five years in prison with three years suspended, followed by three years on probation. Appellant claimed that the sentence was an improper departure from the guidelines because it was possible, if appellant violated his probation, for appellant to spend five years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty to burglary of a structure and second-degree grand theft. A guidelines scoresheet indicated that the appropriate sentence was 12 to 30 months in prison. However, the trial court sentenced appellant to two years in prison, or five years in prison with three years suspended, followed by three years on probation for grand theft to be followed by five years on probation for burglary. Appellant challenged the sentence, claiming that it was an improper departure from the guidelines because it was possible, if appellant violated his probation, for appellant to spend five years in prison. The appellate court affirmed the sentence, explaining that if the trial court imposed a split sentence, or a combination of prison and probation, the prison term was not to exceed the maximum recommended by the guidelines. The appellate court held that appellant's sentence was not a departure from the guidelines because the prison term was within the range recommended by the guidelines. However, the appellate court held that the trial court erred in checking the first split sentence box on the sentence form, so the appellate court ordered that part of the sentence stricken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court affirmed appellant's split sentence to two years in prison, or five years in prison with three years suspended, followed by three years on probation for grand theft. Although a prison term of five years exceeded the sentence recommended by the guidelines, the two-year term that was actually imposed was within the guidelines, so the sentence imposed was not an improper departure from the guidelines.</SPAN></P>

The trial court temporarily enjoined the statute's enforcement, but later held that the statute was constitutional and granted summary judgment to appellees. The court reversed and held that the statute was unconstitutional because it was overbroad and violated rights guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. I and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 4. The 50-foot radius set by the statute around polling places encompassed sidewalks and streets, which were traditional public forums for free expression. Restrictions on First Amendment rights were required to be supported by a compelling governmental interest and to be narrowly drawn so as to involve no more infringement than was necessary. The protection of the orderly process of voting and the secrecy of the ballot were a compelling governmental interest. However, the all-inclusive language of the statute covered many situations that in no way infringed on the state's interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was tried and convicted under Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193 (2)(c). The statute stated that a blood alcohol level of 0.10 percent or more was prima facie evidence that the person was under the influence of alcohol.

The court held that the statute and instruction created an unconstitutional mandatory rebuttable presumption on the issue of impairment, as a reasonable juror could concluded that the appellee state need not offer any further proof or that the jury need not make any additional determinations. The court held that a defendant could only be convicted on proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime.

The officers pursued and stopped him. He was arrested for driving under the influence, Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193(1), and a search incidental to his arrest revealed cocaine. He was charged with possession of cocaine, Fla. Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(e), and with fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1935. Defendant's motions to suppress evidence and to dismiss the charges were denied. The parties stipulated the rulings were dispositive of the case. Defendant pled nolo contendere, reserving the right to take this appeal. The court reversed the order which denied the suppression of evidence. The state had conceded that the license check point was not a lawful road block. The court held that in order to deter law enforcement officers from violating the constitutional rights of citizens with impunity by employing unconstitutional law enforcement methods, it was necessary for the courts to see that the state received no benefit from such unlawful conduct even if relevant evidence was rendered inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the son of a deceased state employee, petitioned for review of an order of the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida) dismissing with prejudice appellant's complaint for declaratory relief and an order of the Department of Administration, Division of Retirement finding that appellant was entitled only to the return of accumulated contributions from the decedent's state employee retirement account.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, decedent's dependent son, applied for benefits from decedent's retirement plan after her death. The decedent had designated her husband as primary beneficiary and her children as joint contingent beneficiaries of her retirement plan. Decedent subsequently divorced but did not file a change of beneficiary. Decedent's former husband and other children disclaimed their right to benefits. The Division of Retirement informed appellant that he was eligible to receive only the benefits to which the primary beneficiary, his father, would have been entitled had he not disclaimed his interest, which was the refund of accumulated retirement contributions, since his father was no longer married to the decedent. Appellant filed a petition for administrative review pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 120.57. Appellant later filed a complaint for declaratory relief in circuit court, seeking a declaration of his rights. The court held that appellant, by reason of the disclaimers filed by his father and the other joint beneficiaries, was entitled to all benefits available from the retirement account as if the disclaimants had immediately predeceased the decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the administrative order and remanded the case. The court dismissed the challenge of the court case as moot, due to the court's resolution of the administrative appeal. The court held that appellant must be treated in law as the sole surviving contingent beneficiary designated by the decedent, due to the disclaimer of benefits by the other beneficiaries, and as such he was entitled as her dependent to receive monthly benefits.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 76-432 provided that members of the school board should be elected in nonpartisan elections. The voters of the county, in a special election, approved ch. 76-432. Appellants contended that the special act violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 11(a)(1), which prohibited special laws pertaining to the election, jurisdiction or duties of officers, except officers of municipalities, chartered counties, special districts or local governmental agencies. The reviewing court stated that, historically, school districts in Florida had been treated as special districts. Furthermore, there were no public policy issues involved, and the state supreme court had previously upheld the constitutionality of a special act governing the election of school board members. Because acts of the legislature were presumed constitutional and appellants failed to meet their heavy burden in asserting otherwise, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to state law, appellee performed a biennial in-depth review of the ad valorem assessment rolls in each county in the state to determine the level of assessment in such county under Fla.

Appellant challenged the estimated assessment level of a certain tax year for a county. The trial court found that appellee utilized professionally accepted methodology in accepting the estimation as required under state law. On appeal, the court held that based on expert testimony, the use of the methodology was lawful because the data reviewed was the best data available and the methodology, while qualitative in nature, was professionally accepted. The court further held that appellant had standing to bring a claim as a taxpayer, but not as a property appraiser. However, the court also held that the disputed statute did not constitute an unlawful delegation of power because the power to make law was not delegated, only the authority as to its execution. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a sentence imposed by the Circuit Court of Monroe County (Florida) for second-degree murder with a firearm. The trial court resentenced defendant within the sentencing guidelines to 22 years imprisonment with a minimum mandatory sentence of 3 years imprisonment. Defendant challenged the sentence as having been unlawfully imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced within the sentencing guidelines to 22 years imprisonment with a minimum mandatory sentence of 3 years imprisonment for second-degree murder with a firearm. He appealed his sentence as having been unlawfully imposed. First, defendant complained that the scoring of points to determine the length of his sentence was in error. The court disagreed. It found no error in the scoring of his crime in this case. Even an error scoring six points for certain prior misdemeanor convictions was entirely harmless, because one point was clearly called for based on defendant's prior misdemeanor conviction, and the reduction of five points from the total scored still placed defendant within the 17-22 year category. Second, defendant argued that it was unconstitutional to impose a three-year mandatory minimum sentence for having carried a firearm, under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.087 (1985), based on his conviction for second-degree murder with a firearm. The court rejected this argument, because the jury convicted defendant on ample evidence adduced at trial, and a three-year mandatory minimum sentence was constitutionally imposed pursuant to the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's sentence for 22 years imprisonment, with a minimum mandatory sentence of 3 years imprisonment for having carried a firearm, was affirmed.

Appellants argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 28.24(13), 28.33 (1985), which allowed appellee to retain a management fee, violated the Takings Clause of the U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant family members obtained a judgment in excess of $ 10 million in a shareholders action against appellee corporation. Because the parties could not agree on disposition of the funds, the funds were deposited into the registry of the court. Following Fla. Stat. ch. 28.24(13), 28.33 (1985), appellee, clerk of the court, retained a management fee of approximately $ 30,000 from the interest earned. After the parties entered into a stipulation, the funds were invested in a certificate of deposit. Appellants asserted that the statutes authorizing appellee, clerk of the court, to charge fees were unconstitutional, as applied to their case because of the large sums of money involved. Appellants contended that the statutes violated the Takings Clause of the U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV. This appeal followed the trial court's denial of appellants' claim. The court affirmed. The court held that the statutory provisions for levying a fee substantially advanced a legitimate state interest and that the 10 percent interest income that was produced by investing the funds did not amount to a violation of either the federal or the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and found that the United States Constitution was not offended by a state statute that allowed appellee, the clerk of the court, to retain a management fee for investing funds placed into the registry of the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant hospital sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) that dismissed appellant's probate and circuit court action against appellee estate after appellee had published a Notice of Administration pursuant to Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent died and his estate owed appellant hospital a large sum of money. A Notice of Administration was published twice in a bi-weekly community newspaper. Appellant filed notice of claim and an independent circuit court action against appellee estate and sought recovery of the amount owed it. Both the probate and the circuit court claims were dismissed. Appellant sought review, asserting that the notice by publication provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 733.212 and 733.702 (1985) were unconstitutional for not complying with the due process requirements of U.S. Const. amend XIV. The appeals court affirmed, holding that the doctrine requiring more notice than that afforded by publication should be applied to notice under nonclaim statutes. Notice under a nonclaim statute did not make appellant a party to the proceeding, it merely notified it that it could have become one if it wished.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee brought suit to declare a town land use restriction ordinance unconstitutional. The trial court held that the ordinance was procedurally and substantively unconstitutional. Appellant sought review. The court reversed, finding the ordinance was not substantively unconstitutional. Appellee failed to show the ordinance bore no reasonable relationship to the public welfare, health and safety, or that the ordinance was confiscatory. There was competent evidence that the ordinance would protect the small town character of the community, prevent traffic congestion, and reduce the risk of crimes against property and persons. The court also disagreed that the ordinance was procedurally unconstitutional. The court found that because appellee did not own the land in question when the zoning ordinance notice was published, and he was not shown to be otherwise an interested person when the ordinance was enacted, he lacked standing to complain that the notice given was not reasonably calculated to afford an opportunity to be heard. Thus, even if there was a defect in notice, which was not shown, appellee lacked standing to challenge the ordinance on that basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellant correspondence school sought renewal of its license, appellee department notified appellant that the application would be denied because appellant failed to comply with appellee department's rule requiring appellant to have a certain liberal tuition refund policy. Appellant filed a formal rule challenge. The hearing officer held the rule valid, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed. Promulgation of this rule did not exceed appellee department's legislative authority. The grant of authority permitting appellee department to promulgate rules which protected the individual student from deceptive, fraudulent or substandard education was broad enough to encompass regulation of refund policies. The rule also did not impose a burden upon interstate commerce. Regulatory statutes which were alleged to impinge upon interstate commerce were evaluated by determining whether they operated evenhandedly, having only incidental effects on commerce, or if they instead discriminated against commerce either on their face or in their practical effect. There was no showing of discrimination in this case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant reporter attended a child custody hearing, over the objection of several of the parties involved. The trial judge allowed appellant to stay with the express agreement that appellant refrain from using information obtained at the hearing if the trial judge later determined that there was authority for mandating that the hearing be confidential. Later that day, the trial judge informed appellant that the hearing was required to be confidential and appellant was not to use any information from it. The next day, appellant's employer published an article containing the restricted information. Appellant was found guilty of indirect criminal contempt of the trial court. The court affirmed the finding and held that appellant's deliberate acts were in direct violation of the trial judge's orders resulting from the judge's attempts to adhere to the law of the state while accommodating the rights of appellant. The court held that the legislative restraint imposed by Fla. Stat. ch. 39.408(2)(c) (1985) to keep custody hearings confidential was identical to the restraint on adoption hearings under Fla.

The trial court dismissed the criminal information holding that the felony statute was unconstitutional. The state appealed and the court reversed. The court held that the misdemeanor statute only forbid the placing of a bet, or being the stakeholder of a bet, and treated these acts less severely than the act of taking or receiving a bet. The misdemeanor statute did not address the taking or receiving of a bet. Only the felony statute did. Therefore, the statute was not unconstitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of felony murder as a result of aggravated child abuse.

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that felony murder did not merge to prevent the conviction of murder because felony murder was limited to certain specific felonies, namely aggravated child abuse, and that intent to kill was not an element of felony murder. The court affirmed the denial of defendant's motion to suppress his first statement, holding defendant's statement occurred during routine questioning , and did not constitute a custodial interrogation requiring a Miranda warning.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee challenged the order of the Deputy Commissioner (Florida), which denied his claim against appellee employer for a lump sum advance payment of compensation or for resumption of permanent total disability benefits on the grounds that he was detained in county jail, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(9) (1974).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee received permanent total disability benefits from appellee employer. Appellee suspended appellant's benefits after he was arrested, charged with a criminal offense, and detained in the county jail pending bond. The deputy commissioner denied appellant's claim for a lump sum advance payment of benefits or for resumption of permanent total disability payments, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 440.15(9) (1974) which prohibits the payment of compensation to permanently disabled persons who become inmates of public institutions. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that ch. 440.15(9) was unconstitutional as applied to appellant. The court found there was no rational relationship between appellant's status as a detainee and any legitimate state purpose. Further, there was no rational basis to deny a permanently and totally disabled person, who was being detained prior to trial, his only source of income from which to post a bond when detained persons with temporary total disabilities would receive their benefits. Such a distinction between classes of claimants was patently arbitrary and a denial of equal protection of laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the order of the deputy commissioner denying appellant employee's claim for a lump sum advance payment of benefits or for resumption of permanent total disability payments, because the statute denying claimant benefits while he was in jail was unconstitutional, as it was not rationally related to a legitimate state purpose and it violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with appellant that Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(2) (Supp. 1974 and 1975), the prosecution issued three informations that charged defendant with committing sexual batteries on children under the age of 11. The trial court dismissed the informations on the ground that the statute of limitations had run as to each charge. The prosecution appealed. The court held that the applicable statute of limitations was determined on the date the crime was committed. The crimes charged were capital felonies at the time they were committed. Therefore, the statutes of limitations that applied to the crimes were Fla. Stat. ch.  932.465 (1973) and Fla. Stat. ch. 775.15 (1975), which provided unlimited limitations periods. Subsequent decisions that made death an impermissible penalty for the crimes and that removed the capital felony designation for the crimes did not affect the applicable statutes of limitations. As no statute of limitations controlled the prosecution of the crimes, the order dismissing the informations was reversed, and the case was remanded with directions that the charges be reinstated.</SPAN></P>

Laws ch. 110, could not be applied to his sentence without violating constitutional provisions regarding due process, ex post facto laws, and separation of powers. The court affirmed the sentence, holding that although not all of the reasons the trial court listed for the upward departure were valid, at least one of the reasons was and, thus, the increased sentence was properly justified. The court also held that application of the amendment to the evaluation of the departure sentence was valid and did not infringe on defendant's constitutional rights because the amendment dealt with a procedural clarification of the law in a case where a trial court listed both valid and invalid reasons for a departure sentence, but did not change the legal consequences of defendant's act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two armed robberies and six robberies. The state supreme court remanded the original sentence for resentencing in accordance with the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing. The court found that the presumptive guidelines sentencing range under the guidelines in effect at the time of the resentencing was between four and one-half and five and one-half years incarceration. Defendant contended that the guidelines in effect at the times of the offenses should apply, that each of the split sentences improperly exceeded the maximum guidelines range, and that the 10 years' probation should be reversed. The court found that since armed robbery was a first-degree felony punishable by life, the split sentence imposed by the trial court at resentencing did not exceed the term provided by general law. The court held that it would not remand for further resentencing pursuant to the guidelines in effect at the times of the offenses because the penalty to which defendant would thereby be exposed would be greater than that to which defendant would be exposed under the guidelines in effect at the time of further resentencing.</SPAN></P>

The hearing officer found that the rule was not an invalid exercise of delegated legislative authority, and appellant sought review.

In addition, the court found that ch. 945.10 was also unconstitutional because it created three classes of people in regards to access to information held by appellee, and there was no logical basis for the classification.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant defendant was convicted of a violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.07(2) (1985) which provided, in part, that a person who while under indictment, displayed, used, threatened, or attempted to use any firearm or carried a concealed firearm was guilty of a felony of the second degree. Appellant contended that the statute was unconstitutional on due process grounds. The court stated that carrying a concealed weapon while not under indictment, prohibited by Fla. Stat. ch. 790.01(1) (1985), was a first-degree misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum of 1 year in prison, whereas the instant offense was a second-degree felony, punishable by 15 years in prison. The court stated that the statute, in effect, criminalized the activity of being under indictment and punished the offense by up to 14 years imprisonment. The court held that despite the rule that every presumption was to be indulged in favor of the validity of a statute when considering its constitutionality, the portions of Fla. Stat. ch. 790.07 (1985) which prohibited certain activities while under indictment were unconstitutional as violative of substantive due process. Reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the portion of the statute which prohibited certain activities while under indictment was unconstitutional, appellant defendant's conviction was reversed and the cause remanded with instructions to discharge appellant unless he was being held on other charges or was incarcerated for other convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that Fla. Stat. ch. 925.036(2)(d) (1985) limited compensation in capital cases to a maximum of $ 3,500 but that the lower court had awarded respondent several times that amount. The court determined that a cap on the amount of compensation available for court-appointed lawyers in capital cases might violate U.S. Const. amend. VI, but the court concluded that an award could be based upon the number of hours that respondent spent on the case multiplied by the hourly rate established by the chief judge, which resulted in a much lower award.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent employee filed a discrimination action against petitioner employer, alleging that a supervisory employee of petitioner had engaged in sexual harassment of respondent.

The appellate court granted the writ and quashed the lower court's decision with instructions to reverse the administrative orders. The appellate court determined that in construing an ordinance specifically patterned after Title VII, which defined employment discrimination, the local administrative agency improperly assumed the judicial task of interpreting the law. The appellate court further held that Dade County, Fla., Code art. III, &sect; 11A impermissibly authorized a cause of action that the Human Rights Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 760.02(6) disallowed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's probation was revoked after he was found guilty of three parole violations. Appellant filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which was denied by the trial court. Thereafter, appellant sought appellate review, arguing that the trial court erred in granting appellees' motion for enlargement of time to respond to his petition and that appellee agency was an unconstitutional state agency that lacked authority to arrest him or revoke his parole. The appeals court affirmed the trial court's grant of appellees' motion for enlargement of time and the denial of grounds 1-5 of the petition, but the appeals court reversed the dismissal of grounds 6 - 10. The appeals court ruled that appellees' statement that they were unaware of the order to show cause established excusable neglect for their failure to file a timely response, forming a proper basis for granting a motion made after the expiration of the specified period. However, since appellant's constitutional claims in this case were different from the declaratory and injunctive relief which appellant sought in another pending appeal, the dismissal of those grounds was erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1978, appellee dentist performed work on one appellant. In 1983, appellant and his wife filed a medical malpractice action based on improper cementing of a post in a cuspid, allegedly damaging a tooth. Appellants also claimed the dental work created a latent defect in the periodontal tissue that was not manifested for years. The trial court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(b) barred appellants' action. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that application of ch. 95.11(4)(b) to appellants' claim did not violate Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 21. The malpractice giving rise to the claim occurred after the enactment of the Medical Malpractice Reform Act of 1975, Fla. Stat. ch. 768, which required commencement of an action within four years of the alleged malpractice. Although appellants contended they discovered the claim only four days before expiration of the statute of repose, they did not file suit until 10 months after it had elapsed. The court also certified a question whether strict application of the statute was required under case law and whether such application violated the Florida Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 718.115(2) (1985), requiring payment of common expenses in assessments against unit owners in proportions provided for in a condominium declaration, was applicable to condominium units represented by appellant. The trial court granted judgment in favor of appellee, and appellant sought review. The court reversed judgment in favor of appellant because the applicable article of appellant's declaration was adopted prior to enactment of Fla. Stat. ch. 718.115(2), and the statute did not have a retroactive effect because the legislature did not expressly provide for it. The court held that any amendment to the declaration of the type represented by Fla. Stat. ch. 718.115(2) could only be adopted by unanimous consent of all unit owners together with certain lienholders. The court held that a provision specifically dealing with a particular subject controlled over another provision only generally dealing with that subject, and an administrative agency could not disregard an established judicial rule of contract construction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction before the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) for solicitation in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 817.134(8) (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant saw an accident, took pictures, said he worked with an attorney, and offered assistance. He was charged with criminal solicitation in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 817.134(8) (1985). After pleading nolo contendere, he moved for arrest in judgment and for a new trial. His motion was denied. He appealed his conviction on the ground his offer of assistance to the accident victim was conditional upon the victim's assistance. The court found his actions and reasonable inferences therefrom met the definition of solicitation. Appellant's post-conviction motions were properly denied due to his nolo contendere plea which was a guilty plea for purposes of post-conviction motions. Appellant's argument for the first time on appeal that the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional for barring commercial speech protected by the First Amendment was not timely. Even if the right to commercial speech were a fundamental right, appellant's knowing nolo contendere plea was a waiver of that contention.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 893.13(1)(a)(1), 893.13(1)(e), and 893.135(1)(c)(1) (1985). He was sentenced to concurrent terms of seven years on the delivery and trafficking charges, and five years on the possession charge. The judgment included imposition of court costs, a mandatory three-year minimum prison term, and $ 50,000 fine for trafficking. On review, appellant argued that the imposition of separate convictions and sentences violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. The court found that appellant could not be simultaneously convicted of sale and possession, in addition to trafficking, because trafficking necessarily encompassed either or both of the other evils. Therefore, the convictions and sentences were reversed and remand. Further, the court struck the costs imposed without prejudice. However, the court found appellant's argument with regard to the $ 50,000 mandatory fine was without merit.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed that the statements made were constitutionally protected and that Fla. Stat. ch. 827.07 (1981) which provided for nondisclosure of child abuse files was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees were acquitted of aggravated child abuse. Appellant reporter was subsequently given access to a prosecutor's file which contained documents that were not disclosable to the public pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 827.07(15) (1981). An article subsequently appeared in appellant publisher's newspaper that contained facts not disclosed at trial. Appellees filed suit against appellants alleging invasion of privacy by public disclosure of private facts. The trial court granted appellee's partial summary judgment on the issue of liability. The court affirmed and held that invasion of privacy did not require that there was a knowing and willing public disclosure, only that private facts were publicly disclosed. The court also held that while the prosecutor was burdened with the responsibility not to disclose, it was appellant newspaper that published the private facts and completed the element of public disclosure. The court held that truth was not a defense against an action for invasion of privacy, but the absence may have been an element in assessing damages. The court further held that invasion of privacy was not protected by U.S. Const. amend. I or U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charge of trafficking in cocaine in an amount of 400 grams or more, but reserved his right to challenge the denial of his motion to suppress. Appellant's luggage was searched after police officers knocked on the door of his private sleeping compartment on a train, demanded his train ticket and identification, and blocked the doorway. Because appellant, who had limited knowledge of English, consented to the search, the circuit court had denied his motion to suppress the evidence seized in the search. On review, the court held that the search was an unjustified intrusion on appellant's privacy and that because no probable cause existed for demanding appellant's identification, appellant was entitled to suppression of the evidence and dismissal of the charges against him.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 370.08(3) (1985), violated the due process provisions of the Florida and United States Constitutions and the commerce clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Finding that Fla. Stat. ch. 370.08(3) (1985) was not preempted by federal law, did not violate the commerce clause, was not void for vagueness, and did not violate equal protection, the court reversed the order and remanded for further proceedings. Chapter 370.08(3) criminalized the taking of food fish within or without the waters of Florida by the use of certain nets, and the possession or sale of fish caught in this manner. The court held that neither &sect; 305(e)(1) of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1885(e)(1), nor an interim regulation, 51 Fed. Reg. 23,511 (1986) (to be codified at 50 C.F.R. &sect; 653), preempted state law. The court also explained that the law's effect on interstate commerce was incidental and inconsequential. The court held that the law was not remotely vague, and found that it well apprised appellees of the proscribed conduct. Finally, the court held that the fact that the law applied to Florida residents acting beyond Florida territorial waters did not violate equal protection as it was rationally related to the legitimate interest of protecting the fishery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order from the Circuit Court for Clay County (Florida) which denied his Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.850 motions regarding the trial court's ex post facto application of Fla. Stat. ch. 27.3455 (1985) used to deny appellant's right to accrued gain time.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of trafficking in cannabis and had costs imposed at sentencing pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 27.3455 (1985) without an initial finding of indigency. The dates of the offenses for which he was convicted were prior to the effective date of ch. 27.3455. Appellant subsequently challenged the order imposing costs without a determination of indigency arguing that the application of ch. 27.3455 to his case was an ex post facto application of the law. Appellant also challenged the denial of his right to accrued gain time because of his inability to pay the costs imposed. The court agreed with appellant noting that the penalties imposed by ch. 27.3455 disadvantaged indigent prisoners whose crimes were committed prior to the effective date of the statute. The court therefore reversed the imposition of either of the penalty provisions of ch. 27.3455 (1985) and remanded for resentencing under ch. 27.3455 (1986 Supp.), giving him notice and an opportunity to be heard on the issue of indigency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county sought review of the decree from the Circuit Court for Sarasota County (Florida) that found that appellant's ordinance, imposing a franchise fee on a utility's customers in appellant's unincorporated areas, did not comply with its supplemental order to correct the dual taxation on residents in appellee cities that violated Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(h) and Fla. Stat. ch. 125.01(7) (1985), and ordered enforcement of the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that appellant county engaged in double taxation (taxation) of the residents of appellee cities in violation of Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1(h) and Fla. Stat. ch. 125.10(7) (1985) by using taxes collected from appellees' residents for services that provided benefits only to the residents of appellant's unincorporated areas, and issued a supplemental order (order) to correct the taxation. Appellant therefore enacted Sarasota County, Fla., Ordinance 82-99 (ordinance) that imposed a franchise fee on a utility's customers in the unincorporated areas to pay for some of the services. The trial court found the ordinance did not comply with the order and issued a decree to enforce the order. On appeal, the court held that appellant could correct the double taxation only by using one of the three options in Fla. Stat. ch. 125.10(b)(a) (1985): by taxes, special assessments or service charges imposed on the residents or property in the unincorporated areas; establishing a service taxing or benefit unit; or remitting the taxes to appellees. The ordinance did not comply with ch. 125.10(b)(a) (1985). Therefore, the court affirmed the decree.</SPAN></P>

At trial, the jury entered a verdict for appellees on the inverse condemnation claim on the grounds that there was probable cause for the seizure. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the mere fact that appellants prevailed in the forfeiture proceeding did not retroactively invalidate the boat's seizure, as it was seized on probable cause. The court also held that appellants could not maintain an inverse condemnation claim, as such claims do not arise from temporary takings or in cases of loss of use due to lawful detention.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his convictions for robbery, burglary, kidnapping, and theft. After the court affirmed the lower court's denial of a motion for postconviction relief, appellant sought rehearing. Appellant argued his guilty plea was not voluntary and trial counsel was inadequate. He alleged that he had delivered to the prison librarian a motion for postconviction relief containing eight grounds for relief plus a 41page memorandum, but that due to a mix-up, an incomplete document was delivered to the trial court, which ruled it was legally insufficient. The court denied the request for rehearing. Technically, the instant motion for rehearing was inappropriate. Even if the trial court determined that appellant's excuse was valid and considered the second motion on its merits, the motion would properly be denied without a hearing, as it too was legally insufficient. The court rejected appellant's contentions that the trial court accepted his guilty plea without any factual basis and that Fla. Stat. ch. 947.16 (1979), by which the trial court retained jurisdiction over a portion of the sentence for purposes of disapproving parole, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was convicted of both crimes. Appellant challenged based on a misleading jury instruction. The court reversed appellant's conviction for murder and remanded for a retrial. Appellant was again convicted. Appellant argued that his conviction for murder in the third degree under Florida's felony murder statute was improper since the underlying felony was not independent and separate from the actual killing. The court agreed with the state's contention that in the instant case no merger of the underlying felony of aggravated battery with the homicide was required. The court found that because the instant case involved only a conviction for the felony murder charge and not for the underlying aggravated battery, the cases relied upon by appellant were distinguishable. The court found that the trial court's imposition of community service pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 27.3455 (1985) compelled reversal because it constituted an ex post facto clause violation, as the offense for which appellant was charged was committed before the statute became effective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of a ruling from the Circuit Court for Pasco County (Florida), which dismissed a second indictment against appellee on principles of collateral estoppel in an action charging appellee with official misconduct pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 839.25.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was indicted on three counts of unlawful compensation. The third count was dismissed as vague and multiplicious. The next day, appellant state charged appellee in a two-count indictment with official misconduct pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 839.25 using the same factual allegations as in the dismissed count. The trial court dismissed the second indictment based on the unconstitutionality of ch. 839.25. Appellee was then acquitted by a jury on counts one and two of the first indictment. The instant court upheld the constitutionality of ch. 839.25 and reinstated the second indictment. Appellee moved to dismiss the second indictment on grounds of collateral estoppel, which the trial court granted. Appellant then sought review. The court found that appellant's case against appellee was based on credibility, and the jury evidently believed appellee because the jury could not have acquitted him in the first case without rejecting the overall scheme of corruption presented by appellant which included the document falsification evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order dismissing the indictment because appellant failed to prove the illegal acts and could not be permitted to try again by simply changing the name of the crime. Collateral estoppel applied where the matter had already been litigated and resolved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed from an order of the Circuit Court for Jackson County (Florida) upholding the validity of a county ordinance imposing the local option gas tax authorized by Fla. Stat. ch. 336.025 (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer owned a truck stop, which he claimed would be economically injured by the adoption of a local option gas tax authorized by Fla. Stat. ch. 336.025 (1985). The lower court upheld the constitutionality of the tax and plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the legislature had great freedom of classification in tax matters. The purpose of the tax, paying for county roads, was legitimate, and the tax was reasonably related to that purpose because it was imposed on everyone that purchased gas in the county. The fact that some people would pay the tax who did not use county-maintained roads, e.g., the interstate, did not invalidate the reasonable relationship between the tax and its purpose because plaintiff did not show how many vehicles paid such tax and did not use county roads. The classification was not suspect because it treated all persons buying gas in the county alike. Some advantage by other providers in other counties that did not adopt the tax was not constitutionally fatal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment upholding the statute and ordinance as constitutional because the tax imposed was for a legitimate purpose and the tax was reasonably related to that purpose. Plaintiff did not show that the tax was so arbitrary and oppressive as to clearly amount to a denial of due process or equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, brother of decedent, sought review of two separate but related orders of the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County (Florida). The order of the probate court denied appellant's motion for an extension of time to file notice with the probate court of an independent civil action pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 733.705(3), while the civil court dismissed with prejudice appellant's independent civil action. The appeals were consolidated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, brother of the decedent and administrator of the estate, filed a claim in probate court as a creditor. Appellee, administrator ad litem appointed to represent the estate relating to appellant's claim, objected. Appellant then filed an independent action in the trial court. Appellee filed notice of the independent action in the probate court pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 733.705(3). Appellee then sought to dismiss appellant's independent action, because although it was timely filed, appellant failed to file the notice as required by ch. 733.705(3). Appellee's motion was granted. Appellant also filed a motion in the probate court for an extension of time to file the notice, which was denied for lack of good cause. The appeals from both orders were consolidated. The court affirmed the probate court's denial of the extension of time, finding that there was no abuse of discretion. The court reversed the dismissal of the independent claim, holding that ch. 733.705(3) operated only as a rule of judicial procedure and not as a statute of nonclaim, and should not have been applied in a manner as to deny substantial justice when the claim was otherwise timely filed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court dismissing the independent action filed by appellant, brother of the decedent, was reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent developer submitted the plat of a 100-lot subdivision to petitioner county. Petitioner conditioned approval upon the addition of a notation to the face of the plat, prior to recording, providing that it had only been reviewed for 100 homes. Respondent developer argued that this was an unauthorized restriction, because the plat complied with all county code and planning board requirements. The reviewing court agreed. Though petitioner's motive was merely to place the affected city on notice that additional fees were possible if further development occurred, the county land development code did not provide for such a notation. Broward County (Florida) Land Development Code &sect; 5-197(f)(1)(c) permitted petitioner to impose additional restrictions only where necessary to insure compliance with the code. Here, respondent was already in compliance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant widow sought review of an order of the worker's compensation deputy commissioner (Florida), which denied appellant's claim against appellee employer and carrier for workers' compensation benefits originally requested by her deceased husband, plus death benefits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's decedent, who was exposed to asbestos throughout his career, filed a workers' compensation claim under Fla. Stat. ch. 440.151 (1973), seeking benefits for a disease caused by inhalation of asbestos fibers. Appellant's decedent was employed by appellee employer in 1971-1973, and was diagnosed with the disease in 1984. After her decedent died, appellant pursued his claim and sought death benefits. The deputy commissioner denied the claim because the decedent contracted the disease before becoming its employee. The appellate court reversed, holding that the requirement of Fla. Stat. ch. 151(1)(a) (1973) that a disease must be actually contracted during employment in a particular occupation does not mean that the disease must be actually contracted while working for the employer against whom a claim for benefits is made. A claimant need only show that the employer against whom benefits are claimed was the employer at the time of the last injurious exposure. The appellate court affirmed the conclusion of the deputy commissioner that the 350-week limitation period in Fla. Stat. ch. 440.151(1)(a) (1973) did not unconstitutionally deny appellant access to the courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying appellant's claim for workers' compensation benefits and death benefits was reversed to the extent that it was based on a finding that the deceased employee's disease was not contracted during employment in the particular occupation. The order was affirmed to the extent that it was based on a finding that death benefits were barred by the statutory 350-week limitation period.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land owner challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court for Hillsborough County (Florida), which in an eminent domain proceeding, denied appellant's request for business damages, under Fla. Stat. ch. 73.071(3)(b) (1985), because appellee was a privately owned electric utility.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a privately owned electric utility, petitioned to appropriate a portion of appellant's land for a right-of-way. Appellant owned and operated a mobile home park on the land, and requested business damages. Appellee filed a motion to strike the claim on the ground that it was not a public body and, therefore, not required to pay, under Fla. Stat. ch. 73.071(3)(b). The trial court granted appellee's motion, and awarded appellant full compensation. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 73.071(3)(b) allowed business damages where less than the entire property was sought, for any damages to the remainder caused by the taking, which included an action for the condemnation of a right-of-way, and for the effect that the taking may have damaged an established business. Fla. Const. art. X, &sect; 6(a) (1985), provided that no private property should be taken except for a public purpose, and with full compensation paid. Full compensation consisted of the property's value and severance damages to any remainder, but business damages did not constitute a part of the concept of full compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court's judgment, which denied appellant land owner's request for business damages, because appellee was a privately owned utility, was affirmed. Appellant lacked standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality, as he would not have benefited from a finding of unconstitutionality. The trial court could not have rewritten the statute to have included his desired damages, only the legislature could have provided such relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pardoned felon petitioned appellee Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission for certification as a law enforcement officer. Appellee refused to certify appellant's petition, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 943.13(4) (1985), citing appellant's past criminal record, and notwithstanding appellant's pardon and evidence of good moral character. Appellant sought review of the final order, arguing that Fla. Stat. ch. 943.13(4) (1985) should not be read as an absolute disqualification of all felons, since it nullified the restoration of civil rights granted by a pardon. The court affirmed, holding that appellee's interpretation of the relevant statutes was due significant deference, and because the court could not find appellee's interpretation clearly erroneous, the court had to uphold that interpretation. In addition, however, the court certified to the Florida Supreme Court, the direct question of whether a pardon relieved a person convicted of a felony of the disqualification from becoming a law enforcement officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State of Florida appealed an order of the County Court for Pasco County (Florida) that found Fla. Stat. ch. 843.06 (1985) to be unconstitutionally vague and overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Fla. Stat. ch. 843.06 (1985) provided that anyone who refused to assist a law enforcement officer in the preservation of the peace, in apprehending or securing a person for breach of the peace, or in the rescue or escape of a person arrested upon civil process, was guilty of a misdemeanor. The trial court found that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and that it placed too much discretion in the officer. The court reversed and remanded for further proceedings because statute conveyed a sufficiently definite warning as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding and purpose, and it gave reasonable notice that a person's conduct was restricted. The court held that the statute was not overbroad because doing or not doing an act requested by a law enforcement officer was not a constitutionally protected activity. The court found that the statute gave law enforcement officers no more discretion than the statute that prohibited resisting arrest, Fla. Stat. ch. 843.02 (1985), which had been declared constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff consumer challenged an adverse summary judgment entered by the Circuit Court, Hillsborough County (Florida), which held that her personal injury products liability action against defendant manufacturer was barred by Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1978) and given retroactive effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff consumer was injured by an allegedly defective laundry press that was delivered by defendant manufacturer to the original purchaser 16 years before. Plaintiff filed her lawsuit almost 17 years after the delivery date. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant because the action was not within the 12-year period prescribed by Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1978). The trial court relied on a state supreme court decision which held that ch. 95.031(2) was constitutional and was retroactive. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that plaintiff's action was time-barred under the statute. Moreover, the court held that the state supreme court intended that its decision as to the retroactive effect of ch. 95.031(2) was clear. The court also rejected plaintiff's argument that defendant had a continuing post-sale duty to warn of or to remedy defects, because the statute of repose extinguished any products liability cause of action after 12 years; thus, there was no further duty to warn of a defect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's summary judgment in favor of defendant manufacturer, holding that the state supreme court decision approving of the state statute which barred products liability actions for personal injuries occurring more than 12 years after the product was delivered was to be applied retroactively, and that plaintiff's cause of action was barred by the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a thirty year sentence for sexual battery and lewd assault on his eight-year-old daughter entered in the Circuit Court for Leon County (Florida), after defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charges under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(4)(e) (1983).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged under Fla. Stat. ch. 794.011(4)(e) (1983) with sexual battery and assault of his eight-year-old daughter and pled nolo contendere. The trial court accepted the plea and issued a sentence. Defendant appealed, asserting that the sentence improperly departed from the guidelines. On review the court did not address defendant's issues, rather, sua sponte, remanded to the trial court to set aside the plea, conviction, and sentence, because defendant could not have been proven guilty of the charge, which specified that the victim be over 11 years, where the victim was eight. The court found fundamental error, as a prosecutor could not negotiate, and a trial court could not accept, a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to an offense that the evidence showed a defendant did not commit, regardless of the rationale for making and taking the plea. Any conviction and sentence that resulted from such a fundamentally invalid plea was illegal and had to be set aside, and the original charges pending prior to the invalid plea were to be reinstated on remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court, sua sponte, reversed and remanded to the trial court to set aside defendant's plea and resulting conviction and sentence, which were based on the improper plea of nolo contendere to charges unsupported by the facts, and to conduct such further proceedings as were necessary to disposition of the case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant victim challenged a judgment by the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida) that granted summary judgment to appellee gun manufacturer in a suit for personal injury damages alleging product liability for a defective gun.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant victim was injured in 1984 by a defective gun, originally purchased in 1971, manufactured by appellee gun manufacturer. In 1974, the legislature enacted a statute of repose which foreclosed actions for products liability after 12 years of the delivery of the product to its original purchaser. In 1981, the statute was held unconstitutional. In 1985, a later court found the statute constitutional, to which the legislature responded in 1986 by abolishing the statute of repose. Plaintiff filed suit in 1986, shortly before the legislature abolished the statute. The trial court granted defendant's motion for summary judgment finding the suit time-barred. On appeal, the court affirmed observing that the statute was constitutional at the time the suit was filed and the time limit had expired. In 1987, courts had decided that repeal of the statute was not retroactive. Judicial language, however, had indicated a preference that abolition of the statute should be retroactively applied. The court certified the questions of retroactive application of the abolition of the statute to the state supreme court recognizing a different interpretation would support a reversal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Summary judgment against appellant victim was affirmed because the statute of limitations time-barred his cause of action. However, the question of whether the repeal of the statute of repose was to be retroactively applied was certified to the state supreme court as a matter of great public importance which, if interpreted differently, would support a reversal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee patient brought a medical malpractice action against appellant physicians and hospital, and a jury awarded appellee damages as a result of appellants' negligence. The trial court also awarded appellee attorney fees. Appellants challenged the judgment in favor of appellee and the amount of damages awarded. The court affirmed the judgment in favor of appellee, but reduced the award of damages. The court found that while there was evidence in the record from which the jury could have inferred the need for future medical treatment, there was no evidence in the record from which the jury could, with reasonable certainty, have determined the amount of medical expense appellee would have been likely to incur in the future. Therefore, the court reversed the award of damages for future medical expenses and directed the trial court to reduce the damages awarded by that amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the final judgment of liability in favor of appellee patient and against appellant physicians and hospital, but reversed the amount of damages awarded in the final judgment because the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's award for appellee's future medical expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owner sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Putnam County (Florida), which issued a mandatory injunction prohibiting him from taking specified actions on his property that were in violation of a county zoning ordinance in a suit brought by appellee county.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court issued an injunction prohibiting appellant property owner from taking specified actions on his property after it determined that appellant knowingly and willingly violated the county zoning ordinance by conducting a marine construction business on property classified as residential. The court found no basis to overturn the trial court's determination that appellant violated the ordinance and, therefore, affirmed the judgment except in two regards. The court amended a prohibition in the injunction against maintaining on the premises vehicles weighing more than one ton. The court held that there was no basis to support the code administrator's interpretation that the ordinance barred the parking of vehicles weighing more than one ton and, thus, it could not be sustained. The court quashed the prohibition against the advertising for, and business use of, appellant's telephone located on the premises. The scope of appellee county's zoning powers was spelled out in Fla. Stat. ch. 163.255(2), and it did not encompass any power to control appellant's use of his telephone.</SPAN></P>

In an estate proceeding, the probate court struck appellants claim against the estate for failing to file a written notice of their commencement of an independent civil action against the personal representative, as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 733.705(3). Appellants argued that the statute constituted an unconstitutional incursion into the authority of the state supreme court to promulgate rules of practice in the state's courts. On review the court found that the statute was constitutionally infirm and there was a clear impingement because Fla. R. Prob. Guardianship P. 5.065(a) required substantially the same information to be provided by the personal representative. The court held that the power to promulgate rules of practice and procedure was vested exclusively in the state supreme court, and that where the same matter was ostensibly controlled by the court ruled and a statute, the rule prevailed in matters of procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant houseboat owners challenged a decision from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida) that upheld appellee state agency's assessment of ad valorem taxes against them. Appellants contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 192.001(17) was unconstitutional as an invalid attempt by the legislature to exclude certain vessels from tax exemption under Fla. Const. art. VII.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were houseboat owners. Appellee state agency, relying upon Fla. Stat. ch. 192.001(17) (1985), determined that the houseboats were excluded from the definition of boats under Fla. Stat. ch. 327.02(27), and therefore were not entitled to the exemption from ad valorem taxation granted to boats by Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect;1(b). Appellants contested the constitutionality of the statute and contended that it was an invalid attempt by the legislature to exclude certain vessels from the exemption. In the alternative, appellants contended that, even if the statute was constitutional, the evidence showed that the houseboats were capable of being used for transportation, and therefore appellants were entitled to the exemption. The trial court upheld appellee's decision and the court affirmed the trial court's holding. The court found that ch. 192.001(17) constitutionally excluded floating structures from the definition of boats. The court also held that there was substantial, competent evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that the houseboats fit within the definition of floating structures. The court concluded that the trial court correctly upheld appellee's assessment.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that defendant could not waive consideration of the fundamental errors by merely failing to object thereto and that due process required a judicial determination that defendant had an ability to pay court costs. The court vacated the judgment imposing costs on defendant, concluding that defendant was twice adjudicated indigent by the trial court and that there was clearly doubt that defendant became non-indigent between trial and appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant jailers were each charged with aggravated battery under Fla. Stat. ch. 748.045, a felony, and malpractice by a jailer under Fla. Stat. ch. 950.09, a misdemeanor. Appellants had restrained an inmate by handcuffing his hands behind his back and chaining his arms upward to the bars of a cell for at least 30 minutes. Another incident involved abuse to a juvenile inmate. At trial, the judge instructed the jury on the offense proscribed by Fla. Stat. ch. 950.09. Appellants challenged their convictions, arguing that that critical words of Fla. Stat. ch. 950.09 such as &quot;willful inhumanity and oppression&quot; rendered the statute impermissibly vague and overbroad and therefore violative of the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed, holding that the language of the statute was readily understood under commonly accepted definitions. Persons of common intelligence would not have to guess that appellant's conduct towards the inmates amounted to extreme or aggravated cruelty as the jury was instructed and such conduct constituted a violation of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon appellant's conviction for the sale of cocaine and possession of cocaine, he was assessed certain costs pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch.  960.20 (1981) and Fla. Stat. ch. 943.25(4) (1981), as well as additional court costs pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 27.3455(1) (1985). Appellant sought review. Upon review, the appellate court found that the trial court properly denied the motion for mistrial pursuant to case law. It further found no error in allowing the jury to read a transcript of a recorded drug transaction while the tape of that transaction was being played. Accordingly, the appellate court affirmed appellant's conviction. However, it reversed and remanded the cause with respect to the assessment of certain costs pursuant to case law. Although a trial judge was able to tax these costs against an indigent defendant, it was only able to do so after due process requirements had been met. The assessment of costs was inappropriate and a new hearing upon proper notice was necessary to determine appellant's ability to pay these costs. Finally, the appellate court affirmed the imposition of additional costs pursuant to ch. 27.3455(1).</SPAN></P>

Judicial review of the proceeding was denied and appellant challenged the decision. Appellant contended that he was entitled to judicial review of the action pursuant to Fla. Stat.ch. 120.68(1). The reviewing court held that in order to have standing to seek judicial review of a final agency action pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 120.68(1), appellant had to show that the action was final, appellees were subject to the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, appellant was a party to the action which he sought to appeal, and appellant was adversely affected by the action. The reviewing court concluded that the matters raised by appellant did not affect his substantial interests and thus did not entitle him to the full procedures of a Fla. Stat. ch. 120.57 hearing. Further, appellant was not entitled to appellate review pursuant to ch. 120.68(1), since he was not adversely affected by appellees' resolution of his grievances.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant asserted that public policy of the state should prohibit the enforcement of an insurance contract covering damages arising from a tortious interference with a contract when the tortious interference involved acts of intentional religious discrimination. Under its contract, appellant was required to pay for losses incurred by an insured as a result of acts that amounted to intentional discrimination. On appeal, the court examined case law stating that it was not contrary to public policy to allow recovery for losses caused by an intentional wrongful act of an insured. The court stated that allowing recovery on the insurance contract did not limit or infringe upon the constitutional rights of either party or the victims of the discrimination. Therefore, appellant's motion was denied, and a question was certified as to whether indemnification for losses resulting from intentional acts of religious discrimination should be permitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was informed against for solicitation in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 817.234(8), and filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.190 (c)(4), contending that no crime had been charged. The trial court denied his motion to dismiss. Appellant then pled nolo contendere, and subsequently made a post-conviction motion for a new trial, which was denied. On appeal, appellant argued that his statement made the alleged solicitation conditional, and therefore, as a matter of law, did not constitute a crime. The court disagreed and found that appellant's actions and reasonable inferences therefrom met the definition of solicitation. The trial court did not err in denying his motion to dismiss. With respect to post-conviction motions, the court found them unavailable to a defendant that entered a guilty plea. The court noted that, even if the motions were available, they were not filed in a timely fashion and should not have been considered by the trial court. Finally, the court found that appellant's plea of nolo contendere was properly accepted, and that he had waived his right to raise questions of violation of his U.S. Const. amend. I rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment by the trial court convicting appellant of solicitation was affirmed because appellant's actions amounted to solicitation, post-conviction motions were not available to appellant, and appellant's plea of nolo contendere was properly accepted.

Stat. ch. 337.27(3) (1984), taking the entire lot was permitted because the acquisition costs were equal to or less than the cost of a partial taking, which included business damages. The court affirmed the trial court's holding permitting only a &quot;partial take&quot; because FDOT was proposing to take more property than it needed, which was unconstitutional. The court also ruled that the attempt of ch. 337.27(3) to limit the state's expenses in exercising its eminent domain power by appearing to allow the state to take an entire parcel of land where the acquisition costs of a partial take exceeded the cost of a whole take was unconstitutional. Taking an individual's land merely to minimize acquisition costs was not a valid public purpose. The court then certified the constitutionality question to the Florida Supreme Court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff municipalities brought an action against defendant municipalities after defendant taxed properties within several municipalities for the benefit of residents of unincorporated areas. After numerous trials and reviews, the trial court entered a final order of a money judgment for damages in favor of plaintiffs. Defendant appealed, claiming money damages were prohibited in a dual taxation case, the list of neighborhood parks used was incorrect, and the amount payable to plaintiffs should have been limited to the amount previously set aside in escrow. The court affirmed, holding that although the trial court was prohibited from ordering a money judgment against defendant for past tax years, the trial court had ordered the money judgment for future tax years. The court held that the neighborhood parks defined in the prior proceedings became the law of the case and defendant failed to show any factual change in the circumstance to warrant a review. The court held that damages were not limited to the escrow amounts because the escrow represented an anticipated amount and defendant had a duty to determine and pay the full amount owed to plaintiffs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of aggravated child abuse in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 827.03 (1985). Appellant sought the court's review of the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on the allegedly lesser-included offenses of misdemeanor child abuse under Fla. Stat. ch. 827.04(2) (1985), and simple battery under Fla. Stat. ch. 784.03 (1985). Specifically, appellant asserted that the jury should have been permitted to determine whether he permitted injury to the victim under ch. 827.04(2), or whether he crossed the line of ordinary, acceptable discipline and had therefore violated ch. 784.03. The court held that the schedule of lesser-included offenses contained in state's standard jury instructions did not include ch. 827.03, but did include ch. 827.04. Therefore, a stepparent could not be guilty of simple battery under ch. 784.03 for disciplining a stepchild, and when a stepparent crossed the line of acceptable discipline, he committed aggravated child abuse. Further, the facts of the case did not support a finding that ch. 827.04(2) was a proper lesser-included offense in the case as appellant inflicted, and not simply permitted, the victim's injuries. Judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction of aggravated child abuse was affirmed where the trial court properly denied appellant's request to instruct the jury on the offenses of simple battery or misdemeanor child abuse because appellant, as the stepparent of the victim, could only have committed aggravated child abuse when he crossed the line of acceptable discipline of the victim, and because appellant could not have been guilty of misdemeanor child abuse.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state agency contended that its order to destroy appellee citrus grove owners' citrus trees that had tested negative for citrus canker, but had come from a nursery infected with citrus canker was a valid exercise of its police power to promote the health and safety of the community. The court determined that the valid exercise of police power generally did not result in a taking requiring compensation, but that there were circumstances as determined on a case-by-case basis where it could. The court found appellant's order to destroy the citrus trees to be a valid exercise of its police power to control a resilient disease, which if spread, would be devastating to the Florida citrus industry. In affirming, the court agreed that the destruction of healthy trees that had been innocently purchased from a nursery where citrus canker was later found was a taking that required compensation. However, because it was an important issue that was likely to repeat itself, the court certified to the Florida Supreme Court the question of compensation for the destruction of healthy, but suspect citrus plants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In December 1975, appellant mother delivered appellant child who was later diagnosed as suffering from severe brain damage. In September 1985, appellant mother and father filed a complaint against appellee hospital and physicians that alleged negligent treatment of appellant child. Motions to dismiss were granted with prejudice based upon application of the statute of repose created by Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(b) (1975) because the action was commenced in 1985 and well beyond the seven-year statutory period for repose. The court affirmed dismissal of appellant complaint because, whether appellant knew or should have known of the incident of malpractice and whether the incident or its effects were fraudulently concealed their cause of action was permanently barred in December of 1982 by the seven-year statute of repose. The statute of repose was not a violation of the constitutional guarantee of access to the courts even if it abolished a cause of action or right otherwise protected because the legislature overwhelmingly established a public necessity for the particular time restraint imposed by Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant county denied plaintiff church's application to improve property that abutted a local road because the addition violated defendant county's development standards ordinance. Subsequently, plaintiff church filed suit seeking a declaration that the ordinance was facially unconstitutional. Defendant county argued plaintiff church waived its constitutional argument because plaintiff's lawsuit included a cause of action for inverse condemnation. However, the court held that both case law and state procedural rules allowed the inclusion of an inverse condemnation claim in plaintiff church's suit. Applying the rational nexus test, the court then upheld the trial court's decision declaring unconstitutional a section of defendant county's ordinance. The court reasoned the section did not require any reasonable connection between the ordinance's requirement that land be given to defendant county and the amount of increased traffic a proposed development of property would generate. The court also upheld the trial court's decision finding two other sections of the ordinance constitutionally valid because the sections did not explicitly allow for unconstitutional takings of property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the state and state officials, sought review of a judgment of Circuit Court, Duval County (Florida), which rejected a challenge by appellee fishermen to the constitutionality of a regulatory scheme for shrimp beds, Fla. Stat. ch. 370.153 (1983), but held that one provision of the statute was unconstitutional in its application to one county. Appellees cross-appealed the finding that statute was a valid exercise of state police power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee fishermen sued for a declaration that Fla. Stat. ch. 370.153 (1983) was an invalid exercise of state police powers, was unconstitutionally vague, unlawfully delegated legislative authority to an agency of appellant state, and was arbitrary and capricious. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statute generally, but enjoined enforcement in one county because one provision, Fla. Stat. ch. 370.153(4)(b) (1983), was unconstitutionally vague due to the impossibility of ascertaining a measuring point for compliance with a &quot;100 yards from shoreline&quot; restriction, and inconsistency with other provisions of the statute. On appeal the court held that ch. 370.153(4)(b) was not unconstitutionally vague. The term &quot;shoreline&quot; had a meaning that was susceptible of common understanding. Appellant state had the power to regulate all manner of fishing within the waters of the state, and the statute was a valid exercise of police powers. The portion of the judgment holding that ch. 370.153(4)(b) was unconstitutional as applied to one county was reversed, and the remainder of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment upholding the constitutionality of a regulatory scheme was reversed insofar as it held that one provision of the statutory scheme regulating shrimp beds was unconstitutional in its application to one county, and was affirmed in all other respects. The scheme was a valid exercise of state police powers.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the petition and entered an order permanently committing appellant's daughter to appellee for adoption.

The court determined that appellant failed to comply with a performance agreement which required appellant to attend individual and group therapy, participate in family therapy, and improve the unsanitary and unsafe living conditions in the home. Appellant's parental rights were terminated not only because of her failure to comply with the performance agreement, but also because of a history of physical and emotional abuse with little prospect for improvement. The fact that appellant consistently denied that any abuse took place and was unwilling to make any adjustments in her life was considered by the trial court in determining whether any further counseling would be beneficial or productive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lessor and appellee lessee entered into a lease. Appellant sued appellee for rent due. The circuit court found for appellee and awarded him attorney's fees. Appellant challenged the award, arguing that his rights under the rental contract were impaired retroactively and unconstitutionally by the application of the attorney's fee statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 83.48 (1983), to a pre-existing contract. On appeal, the court discussed two views of attorney's fees: substantive right versus procedural item of costs. The court agreed that, where the right to attorney's fees was provided by contract, a statute could not affect that right retroactively. The court held that appellee's fees were not based on a contractual provision but were an item of costs based on statute. The court held that, when attorney's fees were an item of costs provided by statute, the effective date of the statute was compared to the date of the accrual of the cause of action in the litigation. Because the effective date of ch. 83.48 preceded the accrual of the cause of action, the award of fees was proper. The court affirmed the judgment, awarding fees for the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Duval County (Florida), which convicted him of capital sexual battery. Defendant challenged the trial court's decision to allow the jury to view videotaped testimony of one of the child victims during jury deliberations, and limiting his participation in the videotaping of that testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of capital sexual battery. The trial court entered an order under Fla. Stat. ch. 92.53 (1985) allowing presentation of the child victims' testimony by videotape. Defendant was allowed to view the videotaping from behind a two-way mirror, and was not allowed to cross-examine. Defendant argued that it was error to allow the jury to view the tape in the jury room, that the Florida statute authorizing the videotaping violated the Florida Constitution, and that the limitations on his participation in the videotaping abridged his right of confrontation under U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court held that it was not an abuse of discretion or reversible error for the trial court to allow the jury to view the videotape because defendant's counsel did not object at the time. The court refused to consider the constitutional issue because defendant did not raise the issue in the trial court. The limitations on defendant's participation in the videotaping properly balanced defendant's right of confrontation with the state's interest in sparing child victims further trauma. Moreover, defendant was allowed to observe and cross-examine the victims when they testified at trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed. Because defendant's counsel did not object when the jury asked to view the videotaped testimony, the court could not say that the trial court abused its discretion or committed prejudicial reversible error. Defendant's limited participation in the videotaping of the victims' testimony did not abridge his constitutional right of confrontation.</SPAN></P>

Appellant also argued that since one of her sentences arose from a judgment of violation of probation, stemming from a 1983 aggravated assault charge, imposition of court costs pursuant to Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment from the Circuit Court for Polk County (Florida), which granted appellees' motions to dismiss appellant's suit against them for tortious interference with an advantageous business relationship, as well as for violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 (1979), and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1985 (1980).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee city through appellees city's employees shut down appellant's lounge for fire code violations. Appellant then sued appellees for damages on various grounds including violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 (1979), and 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1985 (1980). Appellees filed motions to dismiss, and the trial court granted those motions, finding that appellant did not allege sufficient facts against appellee employees to remove the immunity provided to them under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28(9)(a), and that appellee city's actions were clearly discretionary and therefore immune from liability under the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Appellant sought the court's review. The court held that under &sect; 1983, a municipality had no immunity from damages flowing from their unconstitutional acts, nor did &sect; 1983 bar an action against a municipality's officials. Thus, the trial court erred in dismissing appellant's complaint against appellees for that reason. However, because appellant failed to prove that appellees engaged in a racially motivated conspiracy, the trial court correctly dismissed appellant's &sect; 1985 claim against appellees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Dismissal of appellant's constitutional law claims on the basis of appellees' sovereign immunity reversed as appellees were not afforded such immunity from damages flowing from their unconstitutional acts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of dismissal of jail contraband possession indictment under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 951.22, in appellees' favor. The lower court found the statute which prohibited contraband in jails an unconstitutionally invalid delegation of legislative authority that was both vague and overbroad. The court first reversed such holding, explaining the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because a prison was recognized as unlike other regulated agencies due to the need for the procedures to be run by insider prison administrators who could designate the items of contraband which in his experience were potentially harmful. The court then determined the statute as applied in the present case was unconstitutionally vague because there were no guidelines regarding what items could be brought into the jail and selective enforcement existed. Thus, the court found the statute overbroad in its application.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Court affirmed dismissal of contraband possession indictment, in appellees' favor, because although statute which prohibited possession of contraband was not unconstitutionally vague as written, the absence of guidelines outlining what items were prohibited and in what amounts, in conjunction with selective enforcement, rendered the statute as applied overbroad. Court reversed the holding that the statute was unconstitutionally vague as written.</SPAN></P>

As to his points regarding admissibility of hearsay evidence, and instructions to the jury, the appellate court affirmed without discussion. The point raised on his request for a hearing to determine competency merited discussion. Defense counsel filed two motions regarding competency, both referenced Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.210. The trial court denied the first motion. The second motion was, in effect, denied by the failure of the trial court to rule upon it and the conduct of trial. The appellate court found that both motions appeared to comply with all of the requirements of Rule 3.210, and the trial court treated them as such. However, the motions did not substantially establish appellant lacked the ability to assist in preparing his defense. Further, appellate review of appellant's mental health file supported the conclusions of the trial judge. Appellant also argued that the motions were filed pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.216.

Stat. ch. 27.3455(1) (1985), requiring him to pay certain costs associated with his prosecution. First, appellant argued that the imposition of costs constituted an ex post facto application of the statute and a violation of the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions. Second, appellant argued that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay restitution as a condition of probation because the written judgment ordering restitution did not conform to the oral pronouncement at sentencing. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part, holding that the trial court's assessment of court costs was reversible error, even absent a contemporaneous objection, because appellant was not given notice and an opportunity to object to the imposition of costs. However, the trial court was not required to orally announce the conditions of probation. Moreover, the record showed that all parties had agreed to restitution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court for Manatee County (Florida), which convicted him of forgery and uttering a forged instrument, revoked his probation, required him to pay costs pursuant to Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of crimes including forgery and uttering a forged instrument, and was placed on probation. His probation was revoked and he was sentenced to five years in prison for each crime. His sentences were to be served concurrently. He was also ordered to pay costs pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 27.3455, even though he committed his crimes prior to the statute's effective date. On appeal, the court reaffirmed its previous holding that it was unconstitutional to apply ch. 27.3455 to crimes that were committed before ch. 27.3455 became effective. Thus, the court reversed the order that appellant pay costs. The court rejected appellant's equal protection challenge to ch. 27.3455. Next, appellant argued that he should not have been charged with a third degree felony for conspiracy to utter a forged instrument. The court stated that uttering a forged instrument was a third degree felony, but conspiracy to commit that crime was a first degree misdemeanor. Accordingly, the court remanded the case for correction of appellant's sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's convictions were affirmed. The order that he pay costs was reversed because the statutory authority for imposition of costs became effective after appellant committed his crimes.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As the result of injuries sustained when an appliance caught fire, appellant consumers brought a product liability action against appellee manufacturer and retailer.

Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1983). On appeal, appellants challenged the ruling that the action was barred by the statute of repose. The court affirmed but certified as a question of great public importance the issue of whether the statute of repose operated retrospectively to appellant's cause of action that accrued before the effective date of the amendment. After appellants' appeal, the legislature amended the statute of repose and abrogated the statute in product liability actions. The court, however, found that the repeal of the statute had no affect on appellant's suit because the law operated prospectively in the absence of an express intent to provide retroactive effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a corporation and its president, sought review of the trial court's denial of a motion to quash service of process and a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Defendants argued that they did not have sufficient minimum contacts with Florida to satisfy due process requirements of the long arm statute, Fla. Sat. ch. 48.193 (1985). The trial court granted defendants leave to file additional affidavits in support of the motions and then, without the benefit of the affidavit, the trial court denied the motions. The court found that plaintiff alleged sufficient jurisdictional facts to meet the initial burden of demonstrating the applicability of the long arm statute for jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant. The court found that the burden then shifted to the defendants to submit sworn evidence to contest the jurisdictional allegations in the complaint. The court found that because the defendants submitted one affidavit and were granted leave to file another affidavit, the trial court erred in denying the motions; the trial court did not have sufficient evidence to properly evaluate the defendants' contacts with Florida.</SPAN></P>

The department of labor granted that license and appellant sought the court's review contending that the department of labor erred because, under Fla. Stat. ch. 447.04(1) (1985), no person should be granted a license to act as a business agent in the state who was not a citizen of the United States. The court held that the citizen restriction contained in ch. 447.04(1)(a) violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV. This was true where, even if ch. 447.04(1)(a) had within its scope business agents for labor organizations, and even if it was justified under the political function exception to the ordinarily required strict judicial scrutiny to be given under amend. XIV to such a citizenship restriction, the scope of ch. 447.04(10(a) was fatally over inclusive because it also included business agents for private employee labor organizations for which there could be no such political function exception. The department of transportation then was correct in not denying appellee's license on the basis of her lack of citizenship. Order affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to two counts of uttering a forged instrument. In determining appellant's sentence, the trial court assessed points for nine prior convictions, departed upward from the presumptive sentence of the sentencing guidelines by imposing consecutive sentences, and ordered appellant to pay costs pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 27.3455(1) (1985) without determining appellant's ability to pay. On appeal, the court held that the trial court was not required by Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.701(d)(11) to state the reasons for its departure from the guidelines on a separate order. However, because the reasons for the departure were already scored in reaching the presumptive sentence, the reasons, and the upward departure, were impermissible. The court held that points could be assessed only for appellant's prior felony, not his misdemeanor convictions, and that the trial court needed to determine appellant's indigency before imposing costs.

The court rejected appellant's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because the division of people for sentencing purposes into two classes, those subject to school discipline and those not, violated equal protection clause and it was void for vagueness. The court found that the statute was enacted under the state's police power and was intended to protect the public health, safety, welfare or morals. The court held that the purposes of the statute, to maintain and protect the integrity of the school setting and the standing of teachers as role models and the insulation of children from violence, were legitimate legislative aims. The court held that the effect of the statute was a reasonably related means to achieve its intended end and that it did not create an elite class.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees wife and children of decedent brought an action against appellant workers' compensation carrier to recover maximum death benefits pursuant to Fla. Stats. Ch. 440 (1983). Appellant workers' compensation carrier tendered the statutory limit by check to the personal representative of decedent. Appellees sought declaratory relief, arguing the statute violated equal protection and due process. A determination was made that Fla. Stat. ch. 440.16(7) (1983) was unconstitutional because it treated resident wives and dependents more favorably than nonresident wives and dependents. Appellants sought review. In reversing in part, the court held that ch. 440.16(7) was constitutional. The right to compensation was not a fundamental right under either the United States or Florida constitutions, but rather a statutory privilege. The rights contained within the constitutions did not extend to those outside the state or outside the jurisdiction of the United States.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of trafficking in heroin, and was sentenced to a 25-year minimum mandatory prison term. He sought review arguing it was error to deny his motion to suppress a tape recording that was made during the drug transaction. In affirming the decision, the court held that the tape recording was properly admitted. Appellant's reliance on Sarmiento was improper because it predated the amendment to Fla.

Stat. ch. 934.03(2)(c) (1977) that prohibited the interception of private conversations and contained its own exclusionary clause.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mobile home park residents and their association, sought review of a final order of appellee, Division of Land Sales, Condominiums and Mobile Homes (Florida), which denied appellants' petition to initiate proceedings contesting appellee's approval of a &quot;conditions of park residence&quot; prospectus submitted to appellee by the owner of the mobile home park.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, mobile home park residents and their association, argued that appellee, Florida's mobile homes division, improperly approved a prospectus submitted to appellee by the park's owner and, thus, appellants should have been allowed to contest the approval. The court disagreed, concluding that the Florida Mobile Home Act (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 723 (1984), did not contemplate appellants' participation in the prospectus review. First, ch. 723.011 only required that copies of the prospectus be given to prospective lessees and resident lessees at time of lease renewal, the court noted. The court then rejected appellants' contention that their substantial interests were affected by the approval, ruling that any impact on their homes' marketability was speculative, as evidence failed to show that homes could not be sold due to the prospectus, or that the approval process was designed to protect the type of injury appellants asserted. Moreover, appellee's approval did not constitute final agency action, as duties imposed by the Act must still be complied with by the owner. And no impairment of contract occurred, as appellants were free to seek legal redress in an appropriate forum.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Final order affirmed denying petition by appellant, mobile home park residents and their association, to initiate proceedings contesting appellee agency's approval of a &quot;conditions of park residence&quot; prospectus submitted to appellee by the park's owner, as governing statute did not contemplate their participation in prospectus review, as no substantial interest of appellants was shown to be affected, and as appellee was inappropriate forum.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant chemical corporation sought review of order from the Circuit Court of Leon County (Florida) dismissing appellant's complaint for declaratory judgment. Appellee, Florida Department of Environmental Regulation, filed a motion to dismiss on grounds that appellant failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The trial court found that it did not have the authority to determine whether Fla. Admin. Code R. 17-4.022(8) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant chemical corporation sought review of order which granted appellee, Florida Department of Environmental Regulation's, motion to dismiss appellant's complaint on grounds that appellant failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. Appellant alleged that appellee was estopped from denying the validity of jurisdictional determination which appellee had previously prepared for appellant. Appellant alleged that Fla. Admin. Code R. 17.4.022(8), adopted by the legislature in Fla. Stat. ch. 403.8171, and upon which appellee based its refusal to validate the same jurisdictional determination, was unconstitutional. The trial court found that it did not have the authority to determine the constitutionality of the rule. The appellate court concluded that because of the peculiar nature of the agency rule, Fla. Admin. Code R. 17-4.022 should not be treated as a typical agency rule, but rather as a statute. This particular rule was different from other agency rules as its authorizing statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 403.817(1983), required approval by an act of the legislature. Thus, the constitutional challenge could be brought before the court without administrative remedies being exhausted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded in appeal by corporation of order granting appellee, Florida Department of Environmental Regulation's, motion to dismiss on grounds that appellant failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The constitutional challenge could be brought without administrative remedies being exhausted. The dismissal order was affirmed to the extent that it dismissed remainder of action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, husband and wife, sought review of the order from the Circuit Court for Pinellas County (Florida) that granted appellee, a manufacturer's, motion for summary judgment. Appellants claimed that the amendments of Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1986) that deleted the 12 year repose provisions for products liability claims in ch. 95.031(2) (1979) should be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant wife was injured by a punch press manufactured by appellee, a manufacturer, 31 years after appellee delivered the press to its original purchaser, and appellants, husband and wife, sued appellee. The trial court granted appellee's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1979) barred all products liability claims brought more than 12 years after the date the press was delivered to its original purchaser. Although 1986 Fla. Laws ch. 86-272 amended ch. 95.031(2) (1979) by deleting the 12 year repose provisions for products liability actions, the statute did not take effect until after appellants filed their notice of appeal of the trial court's order granting summary judgment. Because there was no clear legislative intent to make the amended statute retroactive, appellants' complaint was governed by the original repose provisions of ch. 95.031(2) (1979). Therefore, appellants' claim was time-barred, and the court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order granting appellee, a manufacturer's, motion for summary judgment. The court held that the 12 year statute of repose for products liability claims in effect at the time appellant wife was injured barred appellants' claims, and that the repeal of the repose provisions in the statute that took effect after the trial court granted appellee's motion, could not be applied retroactively to revive appellants' claims.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's decedent was killed while operating a tractor manufactured more than 12 years earlier by appellee. Appellant brought a wrongful death action against appellee. The trial court dismissed the action on the basis of Fla. Stat. ch. 95.031(2) (1985), which provided that product liability actions had to be commenced within 12 years after the date of delivery of the completed product to its original purchaser. The appellate court affirmed the trial court decision on the authority of Pullum v. Cincinnati, Inc., 476 So.2d 657 (Fla. 1985), which held the statute in question to be constitutional. However, the court found the questions involved in the case were recurring and appeared to be of great public importance. The court therefore certified the following to the supreme court: did the 1986 legislative amendment to ch. 95.031(2), abolishing the statute of repose in product liability actions, operate retrospectively to a cause of action that accrued before the effective date of the amendment? If not, did the decision of Pullum v. Cincinnati, Inc., 476 So.2d 657 (FLA. 1985), apply so as to bar a cause of action for wrongful death that accrued before the decision?</SPAN></P>

Appellants argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it was vague and overbroad, because the burdensome and costly registration and reporting requirements operated as prior restraints on protected free speech in violation of U.S. Const. amend.

The court affirmed the ruling of the trial court, holding that the statute was constitutional because it was designed to protect a charitably minded public from being improperly solicited, abused, and defrauded.

At trial, out-of-court statements made by the daughter were admitted pursuant to the child hearsay statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 90.803(23) (1985). Appellant was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that ch. 90.803(23) did not violate appellant's confrontation rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI or Fla. Const. art I, &sect; 16, because the statute provided that such out-of-court statements would be admissible only if the child were available to testify, or if the trial court determined the statements were reliable. The court also held that application of ch. 90.803(23), which became effective after appellant committed the crime, was not an ex post facto violation under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and Fla.

The court held that the state had the power to deny certain civil rights to individuals owing to their convictions for felonies, and thus it was within appellee's discretion to deny appellant the license she sought. The court also rejected appellant's contention that ch. 402.305(1)(a)(26), which authorized denying her a day care license, was unconstitutional due to the fact that it established an irrebuttable presumption that she was not fit to provide day care, finding instead that the statute established only a rebuttable presumption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lessee company and its president challenged a judgment from the Circuit Court for Dade County (Florida), which enforced through the court's contempt powers a settlement agreement between appellants and appellee company relating to a dispute over certain leased premises.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant lessee company and its president challenged a judgment that awarded appellee lessor damages, enforced the parties' settlement agreement through the court's contempt powers, and awarded appellee its attorney's fees in its suit to enforce the settlement agreement, which had been reached in a dispute concerning the lease. The agreement rendered appellants liable for certain repairs to the premises. The court reversed the damage award, which arose from appellants' failure to repair the premises to appellee's satisfaction, because the award was based solely on appellee's evidence and because there was no agreement between the parties that repairs had to meet appellee's approval. The court ruled that use of the contempt power to enforce the agreement, which was not part of the final judgment, was error and that compelling appellants to post a bond to satisfy a judgment or suffer imprisonment for contempt amounted to imprisonment for debt, which was prohibited by Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court reversed the award of attorney's fees because the parties had agreed to bear their own costs and fees and because there was no statutory or contractual basis it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that enforced the parties' settlement agreement via its contempt power and that awarded appellee lessor damages and attorney's fees. The damage award, arising from appellants' failure to repair the premises as agreed, was improper because the trial court sua sponte conditioned the adequacy of the repairs upon appellee's approval, and the use of the contempt power to enforce the agreement was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The trial court awarded summary judgment in favor of appellee on the ground that no common liability existed between appellants and appellee. The reviewing court reversed. The court held that the parties' common liability under the contribution statute was not extinguished with the state supreme court's resurrection of a procedural defense that did not exist and could not have been foreseen at the time of settlement. Because it was unknown whether such procedural bar would have defeated the underlying tort claim, common liability was not defeated. Although the potential procedural bar could eliminate liability of both appellants and appellee to the underlying plaintiff, where the effect of the procedural bar was unknown, it did not defeat common liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a police interview shortly after appellant's arrest, appellant was asked if he would submit to a hand swab test for gunshot residue. Appellant refused to take the test. At trial, testimony of appellant's refusal was admitted over his objection. Appellant was convicted for second-degree murder, and he appealed. On appeal, the court held that because appellant was not told that his refusal to submit to the test would have consequences adverse to him, it could not be said that his refusal was circumstantial evidence probative of his consciousness of guilt. The failure to communicate to appellant that the test was compulsory carried with it the implicit suggestion that appellant had a right to refuse. The court concluded, therefore, that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence that appellant refused to submit to the test, and that its admission prejudiced appellant's right to a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees intervened in a declaratory judgment action brought against appellant state comptroller after the conclusion of the action. The trial court granted appellees' motion to enforce the final judgment, and appellant challenged the order and the intervention. The court reversed the decisions and found that, as a general rule, after litigation resulted in a final judgment, third persons were not allowed to intervene as parties to the litigation. The court also found that an exception existed which permitted a trial judge to allow intervention after final judgment when doing so in no way injuriously affected the original litigants and when intervention furthered the interests of justice. The court held, however, that appellees were strangers to the litigation, raised new issues, and sought different relief, and therefore appellees should have instead filed an action against appellant.</SPAN></P>

While respondent agreed with petitioner that under Fla.

Petitioner sought a writ of prohibition prohibiting respondent from allowing the wrongful death action to proceed. The court denied the writ on procedural grounds. It found that was not appropriate because the grounds raised in the petition could be raised on direct appeal if petitioner suffered an adverse judgment below. The court further held that the denial of a motion to dismiss brought on statute of limitations grounds could not be remedied by the extraordinary means of prohibition, in the absence of the denial of fundamental constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

In addition, appellant contended that imposition of costs against him without a determination of his indigency status violated the clear language of the statute. Appellant claimed that the statute unconstitutionally discriminated against indigent defendants. The court determined that the imposition of costs was reversible error because appellant had no notice or opportunity to object and the trial court's oral imposition of the costs did not constitute notice. The court reversed the imposition of costs and remanded for further proceedings. The parties agreed that there would be no ex post facto violation if the trial court applied the newly amended Fla.

Appellant unsuccessfully requested a declaration of indigency for purposes of receiving community service in lieu of court costs to acquire gain time. The court reversed the imposition of court costs. The court held that court costs were intended to be imposed only on non-indigent persons, and the trial court erred when it imposed court costs on appellant. The court held that assessment of costs was permissible only after adequate notice and opportunity to object, and collection of costs could be enforced only after a finding of the ability to pay. The court remanded for a determination of indigency. The court also held that the trial court did not err when it sentenced appellant in excess of the guidelines without a scoresheet and written reasons for departure, because his guilty plea was made in exchange for a sentence which exceeded the guidelines recommendation for his offense, and this constituted a clear and convincing reason for departure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the County Court for Volusia County (Florida) that granted appellee's motion to suppress the results of a blood alcohol test on the grounds that Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1932(1)(c) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was charged with driving under the influence under Fla. Stat. ch. 316.193 and with careless driving under Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1925, after appellant's blood test, administered under Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1932(1)(c), showed an illegal blood alcohol level. Appellee filed a motion to suppress the results of his blood test, which the trial court granted. The trial court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1932(1)(c) violated the U.S. Const. amend. IV because it lacked an express requirement of probable cause. The court disagreed because a probable cause requirement could be implied by reading Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1932(1)(c) together with Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1932(1)(a), the statute permitting a breath or urine test with probable cause. Under Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1932(1)(c), a blood test could only be administered in a medical facility where a Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1932(1)(a) breath or urine test would be impossible or impractical. Thus, the law enforcement officer had probable cause for Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1932(1)(a) testing before contemplating the Fla. Stat. ch. 316.1932(1)(c) test. The court reversed the trial court's motion to suppress and remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order that granted appellee accused's motion to suppress the results of a blood alcohol test because the court found the blood testing statute to be constitutional. Reading the statutory subsection together with another related subsection implied a probable cause requirement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Officer was tipped that a black man wearing all white was selling cocaine in a bar. Appellant was arrested after the officer found him as described at the specified bar. Appellant sought review of his conviction for cocaine possession and concurrent sentences of five and one-half years prison terms for three probation violations. The court found that the motion to suppress was properly denied because the informant was reliable and appellant's description and location was specific enough to provide probable cause. The imposition of court costs under Fla. Stat. ch. 27.3455 (1985) was reversed as a violation of ex post facto restrictions because appellant was convicted before the statute went into effect, but the question was certified. Appellant's sentences on the offenses for which his probation was revoked were set aside and remanded, because aggravated assault and possession of a controlled substance were third degree felonies with a maximum prison term of five years under Fla. Stat. ch. 775.082(3) (d) (1985). The court also remanded with orders that the lower court set forth the amount of jail time credit for all sentences imposed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant's conviction for cocaine possession was affirmed because reliable informant's tip provided sufficient probable cause to search appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, two surgeons and a county hospital, sought review of a judgment from the Circuit Court for Broward County (Florida) that found for appellee patient. Appellants' points of error included the award of future medical expenses absent evidence, the failure to deduct collateral source payments, lack of evidence of negligence of the attending surgeon, and the failure to limit damages assessed pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28 (1986).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found insufficient evidence to support an award for future medical expenses, and held that the final judgment had to be reduced accordingly. The court acknowledged that while the jury could infer a need for future medical treatment, there was no evidence to allow the jury to calculate those damages to a reasonable certainty. The court next held that the trial court committed reversible error by failing to hold a hearing, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 768.50(1) (1983), on appellants' motion to reduce the judgment by the amount of any collateral sources. The court found no error in the trial court's refusal to grant the motion for directed verdict made by appellant attending surgeon. The court held that appellant lead surgeon's testimony established a duty on all participants to make sure that all clamps had been removed from appellee before suturing, and noted that Fla. Stat. ch. 768.45(4) (1985) set the failure to do so as prima facie negligence. The court also held that it was error not to apply Fla. Stat. ch. 768.28 (1983) to limit the judgment and attorney fees awarded against appellant county hospital.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the final judgment of liability in favor of appellee patient and against appellants, two surgeons and a county hospital, but reversed the amount of damages awarded, and remanded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, under indictment for various felonies, sought review of an emergency order of appellee, Insurance Commissioner of the State of Florida, which temporarily suspended appellant's limited surety agent's license pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 648.45(1) (1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, under felony indictment, argued that because Fla. Stat. ch. 648.45(1) (1985) called for the immediate suspension of his limited surety agent's license, without providing for a pre-suspension hearing, the statute violated his due process rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. The court disagreed, noting first that the statute's silence in providing for notice and a hearing were insufficient to invalidate it when these requirements were incorporated by implication from Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 4-38.53. The court added it was not necessary that the hearing precede the temporary suspension because appellant's interest in the license did not involve a life or liberty interest. Due process was satisfied because appellant would be provided a hearing prior to the final deprivation of this license. Moreover, the immediate suspension was necessitated by the public's interest in being protected from the risk of abuse by a potential felon. Appellant's equal protection argument also failed, the court held, as a legitimate reason existed for treating bail bondsmen differently from other licensees: their need for firearms in performing their occupation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Emergency order temporarily suspending appellant's bail bondsman's license was affirmed because appellant, under felony indictment, was not deprived of due process when license was suspended without a hearing, as hearing would be held before final revocation and public needed protection from risk of abuse, and because treating bail bondsmen differently than other professional licensees was justified and did not deny appellant equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state government charged appellee criminal defendant with unlawful possession of marijuana. Appellee moved to suppress the evidence of the marijuana, discovered after a traffic stop of appellee's truck and the boat it was towing, on the ground that his initial detention was unconstitutional. The trial court granted appellee's motion, and ordered the evidence suppressed. On appeal, that order was reversed and the case was remanded for a trial at which the evidence would be admissible. The court held that there was sufficient grounds for the police officers to be suspicious of appellee's activities, given that he was trying to attach a boat to his truck at an odd hour for such actions and in a location where drug shipments were known by the police to be prevalent. In addition, appellee had committed a minor traffic infraction for which, under state law, he could be stopped; therefore, the stop itself was lawful.</SPAN></P>

Respondent claimed that it had inadvertently failed to list one of its WBE subcontractors on the form and that the WBE requirement was ultra vires of petitioner's statutory authority under Fla.

The trial court expressed the view that the appellant had the ability to earn money while in prison. The motion was denied. The court held that indigency was to be determined at the time of sentencing and those persons found to be indigent must be ordered to serve a term of community service in lieu of additional costs.

Appellees filed 20 complaints in the circuit court and challenged the central ad valorem tax assessments for the tax years 1980 through 1984 rendered by appellant with respect to their migratory rolling stock. The complaints asserted the assessments to be invalid in their entirety and unconstitutionally discriminatory, in that the similarly situated migratory rolling stock of competing nonresident railroads were not subject to taxation in the state.

Stat. ch. 95.11(4)(b) (1983) was unconstitutional. Petitioners sought a writ of prohibition challenging the trial court's decision. The court denied the prohibition, holding that ch. 95.11(4)(b) was inapplicable to respondent's action because it did not become effective until after the date on which respondent was misdiagnosed and could not be applied retroactively. The court held that respondent filed her action within the applicable statute of limitations under Fla.

The petitions reflected that respondent department of insurance filed an administrative complaint against petitioner for transacting insurance as an agent for an unauthorized insured in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 626.901(1). Thereafter, petitioner brought an action against respondent in the circuit court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The complaint alleged that federal law preempted the statute relied on by respondent and, thus, the filing of the administrative complaint was unconstitutional as violative of the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution. Because the trial court decided not to consider the constitutional issues, petitioner filed the writs of mandamus and prohibition. The reviewing court stated that when a party raised a proper constitutional question, the circuit court should proceed with the determination of that issue and stay the administrative proceeding. Therefore, the court granted the petition for mandamus and granted the petition for prohibition staying the administrative hearing until the circuit court disposed of the constitutional issues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a publicly owned utility provider, sought review of a decision from the Circuit Court for Palm Beach County (Florida), which entered a declaratory judgment finding that appellee school board was exempt from paying impact fees assessed by appellant in anticipation of a school's connection to appellee's sewer system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a declaratory judgment holding that appellee school board was exempt under Fla. Stat. ch. 235.26(1) from having to pay impact fees assessed by appellant, a publicly owned utility provider, in anticipation of a school's connection to a sewer system. The court rejected appellant's claims that the trial court erred in finding that ch. 235.26(1) was a constitutional exercise of the legislature's power and in finding that appellant's charges qualified as impact or service availability (ISA) fees under ch. 235.26(1). The court concluded that the charges at issue were ISA fees in accordance with the ISA fee definition in Fla. Admin. Code r. 6A-2.01(45). The court also found that ch. 235.26(1) did not violate the state or federal constitutions. Chapter 235.26(1) did not involve a suspect class and bore a reasonable relationship to the state's legitimate interest in limiting capital outlays for schools. Finally, the court failed to understand appellant's claim that ch. 235.26 conflicted with appellant's enabling legislation by subjecting appellant to local agency supervision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced for probation violations to combined terms that exceeded the guideline range and was further ordered to perform community service pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 27.3455 (1985). Defendant was given community service in lieu of costs because he was indigent. He asserted that ch. 27.3455 was unconstitutional because it was an unreasonable and unlawful tax unrelated to any actual costs and violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that ch. 27.3455 was constitutional, finding that the costs were divided among agencies involved in the criminal justice system. The court held that the imposition of cost assessments against persons violating penal laws was not a direct tax and was appropriately levied upon those who should be made to share in the burdens of the agencies. The court also rejected an assertion by defendant that community service was imprisonment for debt, finding that community service was not incarceration. The court reversed that part of defendant's sentence that departed from the guidelines, finding that the trial judge failed to enter written reasons for the departure.</SPAN></P>

On review, appellant contended that a municipality was entitled to defray the fair share of increased capital costs for furnishing utility service to new customers by establishing a charge in excess of the contracted amount as an inherent and implicit reasonable exercise of its police powers. The court found that the increased connection fee of $ 1,550 imposed by appellant through its ordinance was an unreasonable exercise of governmental authority because it was arbitrary and discriminatory, and did not defray costs on a fair share pro rata basis.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed an order of the trial court assessing costs against defendants, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 27.3455(1) (1985), after they either pleaded guilty or nolo contendere. Defendants appealed, claiming the trial court erred in applying the statute ex post facto because the offenses were committed prior to the effective date of ch. 27.3455(1), and erred in failing to consider the defendants' indigency before assessing costs against them. The court reversed all but one of the orders, holding that upon motions by defendants, the trial court was required to determine indigency before assessing costs because a defendant found to be indigent could have been ordered to serve a term of community service in lieu of costs. The court did not address the ex post facto argument because it was not raised before the trial judge, and defendants could not claim ineffective assistance of counsel since there had been no prior determination of the ex post facto issue. The court affirmed the order as to one defendant because that defendant did not file a motion to be declared indigent. The court remanded for further proceedings to determine the indigency of the remaining defendants.</SPAN></P>

The court on appeal held that the law which resulted in the enactment of ch. 192.037 was not within the purview of the call of the governor for Special Session D of the 1982 Legislature, inasmuch as Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the circuit court's order. Appellee was charged with grand theft and pled nolo contendere. Appellee was placed on probation and was ordered to pay court costs in accordance with Fla.

The trial court granted appellee's motion to declare the statute unconstitutional on the ground that its effect was to amend Fla. Stat. ch. 944.27, dealing with state prison gain-time, and Fla. Stat. 939.05, dealing with court costs applicable to indigent defendants, and that the requirement to perform forced labor due to an inability to pay court costs violated U.S. Const. amend XIV. On review the court found that appellee was without standing to challenge the statute on the basis of its relationship to the statutes pertaining to gain-time, inasmuch as appellee was placed on probation and not subject to the gain-time statutes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded with directions to vacate a judgment of conviction for possession of a machine gun and an order revoking probation. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in denying suppression of evidence because there was insufficient probable cause to support the issuance of the search warrant, false and misleading statements supported the search warrant affidavit, and the exclusionary rule good faith exception did not apply. The court agreed that the search warrant was invalid. The exclusionary rule applied in probation revocation proceedings. Fla. Stat. ch. 933.04 required that probable cause support the issuance of search warrants. The facts in the affidavit supporting the search warrant formed an insufficient predicate under the &quot;totality of the circumstances&quot; test. Therefore, issuance of the search warrant was unjustified. The good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not validate the search because the judge issuing the search warrant was not furnished sufficient facts to determine the veracity of the source or the accuracy of his information, and the officers attempted no independent investigation. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The appellant sought review of an order by which his motion for stay of execution was denied. The appellant contended Fla. Stat. ch. 56.16 (1983), was unconstitutional. The appellant leased a catering box to appellee individual. After the individual mounted the box on her truck, the truck was seized pursuant to a levy. The appellant sought recovery of his catering box by filing an affidavit of ownership, but he asserted inability to post the bond required by that statute. The sheriff refused to halt the execution sale unless the appellant posted bond. The appellant filed a motion for stay of execution, which was denied. Later, the sheriff sold the truck, with appellant's catering box attached. The appellant contended he was denied a post-seizure hearing in which to assert ownership of his property, and that such denial was an unconstitutional violation of due process. The court held that because the appeal was directed only to the order denying stay of execution filed in the original action out of which execution arose, the court found the trial court properly denied relief. The appellant was not a party to that action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appellee father's petition for dissolution of marriage, a hearing was held on the issue of custody of the minor children of appellee and appellant mother. Testimony was taken that appellant allegedly was brainwashed by a religious organization, making her incapable of providing proper care for the children, but testimony was also presented to the contrary. The trial court concluded that the religious organization was detrimental to the continued welfare of the children, but awarded their custody to appellant subject to the condition that she sever connection with the religious organization. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that the condition violated appellant's right to free exercise of religion under U.S. Const. amend. I and amend. XIV. The controlling consideration in the custody determination was to have been the best interests of the children. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 61.13(3), all factors affecting the children's welfare were to be evaluated. Appellant's religious beliefs may have been considered as a factor, but it was impermissible to condition the custody award upon the restriction of appellant's right to free exercise of religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teachers' unions sued appellee state officials and agencies, seeking a decree that the Merit Schools Program and the State Master Teacher Program, Fla. Stat. ch. 231.532 and 231.533 (1984), were unconstitutional. The lower court rejected appellants' arguments. On appeal, the court affirmed, adopting the lower court's reasoning as its own. The court held that teacher bargaining rights were not abridged by the statutes, and summarily rejected appellants' claim that the statutes' criteria for awarding grants resulted in overregulated mandatory collective bargaining. In addition, the court rejected appellants' claim that the statutes granted an unlawful standardless delegation of legislative authority to the state education department. While the legislation granted that department the power to administer the law, it did not grant it power to determine the law. Finally, the court held that the statutes' educational requirements for teachers were not irrationally related to a legitimate state interest, and thus passed constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the order of summary judgment, arguing that the terms &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;substantial&quot; were deficient.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation made a brief contact with appellee Florida corporation at a convention in Texas and later by phone regarding appellee securing a lender for appellant's home improvement program in exchange for a commission. After the lender was secured, appellant refused to pay the commission and appellee brought suit against appellant in Florida. The trial court found that it had personal jurisdiction over appellant pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 48.193(1)(g). Appellant sought review and argued that it neither solicited not conducted business in Florida and therefore the trial court's exercise of jurisdiction offended due process. The court agreed, noting that the court could acquire personal jurisdiction over a non-resident only if the non-resident had sufficient minimum contacts with the state that the maintenance of the suit did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. The court held that a long-arm statute was unconstitutional unless it was interpreted according to the principle of minimum contacts. The court therefore reversed the trial court's determination that it had personal jurisdiction over appellant.</SPAN></P>
