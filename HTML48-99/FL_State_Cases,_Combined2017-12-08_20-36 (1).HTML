</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The District Court of Appeal (Florida) certified a petition for certiorari directed to a decision affirming the trial court's holding that an amendment to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46.01 was unconstitutional because the subject of the amendatory statute was not adequately expressed in its title and the statute dealt with more than one subject, contrary to the provisions of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Non-resident defendants contended that an amendment to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46.01 had rendered it inapplicable to non-residents. The trial court held that the amendment was unconstitutional because the subject of the amendatory statute was not adequately expressed in its title and the statute in question dealt with more than one subject, contrary to the provisions of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 16. The amendment, 1963 Fla. Laws ch. 63-572, was a revisor's bill. The statutory revision power was not intended to make changes in the substantive law without express legislative action. The court reversed and held that the revisor's notes must give the reason for each recommended change and were an integral part of a revisor's bill; therefore, they must be considered in interpretation. The revisor's note established that the intent of this amendment was to eliminate an affidavit requirement, not to make the section applicable to non-resident defendants. The court held that the constitutional requirements were inapplicable to revisor's bills where many subjects must be dealt with in one bill to accomplish the purpose of continuing revision and that 1963 Fla. Laws ch. 63-572 was validly enacted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court was petitioner's request for a writ of prohibition to prohibit the prosecution of petitioner for the alleged violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 877.02(1) for intentionally and unlawfully soliciting legal business. Petitioner argued that &sect; 877.02(1) was unconstitutional under Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought a writ of prohibition from the court to prohibit the prosecution of petitioner for the alleged violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 877.02(1) for intentionally and unlawfully soliciting legal business. Petitioner's main contention was that &sect; 877.02(1) was unconstitutional because it violated Fla. Const. &sect; 12 of the Declaration of Rights and U.S. Const. amend. I, V, XIV. The court disagreed and denied the writ of prohibition. The court determined that &sect; 877.02(1) was enacted within the legislature's purview and was not so vague, broad, indefinite and ambiguous as to render it unconstitutional. The court explained that the prohibited conduct under the statute was confined to only those attorneys directly or by their agents, employees, or by others acting in their behalf engaged in the solicitation of legal business. The court further held that &sect; 877.02(1) was constitutional because it was enacted for a legitimate reason--to protect others from an unethical social evil.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the writ of prohibition, concluding that the legislation at issue was constitutional. The court held that the statutory provision was not overly broad, vague, or indefinite because it only prohibited the solicitation of legal business from attorneys, a specified group of persons. The court further ruled that the statute was enacted for a legitimate purpose--to protect others from an unethical social evil.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant state board of dental examiners filed an action against appellant unlicensed dentist charging him with the unauthorized practice of dentistry in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 466.29. Appellant sought to have the complaint dismissed on the basis that the statute was unconstitutional as a bill of attainder. The circuit court denied appellant's motion to dismiss, and appellant challenged the order. The court affirmed, holding that the provision for the filing of a copy of the records of complainant indicating that the person charged was not a licensee under ch. 466.29 was not a bill of attainder. Due proofs and a hearing on the issue of unlawful practice of dentistry were a necessary condition precedent to issuance of any injunction, temporary or permanent, and the question of its issuance was within the sound discretion of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed denial of appellant unlicensed dentist's motion to dismiss because it was within the circuit court's authority, subject to the requirement for due proofs and a hearing on the issue of unlawful practice of dentistry, to determine whether an injunction should be granted or denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant councilmen sought review of a judgment from a chancellor (Florida) holding that the recall procedure under Special Acts of 1955, 1955 Fla. Laws ch. 55-31007, &sect; 28, by which the recall of appellants was undertaken by appellees, a city and the city clerk, did not in violate Fla. Const. Declaration of Rights, &sect; 12 and the U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a judgment holding that Special Acts of 1955, 1955 Fla. Laws ch. 55-31007, &sect; 28 (statute) was constitutional. Appellees, the city and the city clerk, undertook to recall appellants, city councilmen, pursuant to the statute's procedure. Appellants argued that the statute violated Fla. Const. Declaration of Rights, &sect; 12 and the U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV by failing to provide for notice of the filing of a recall affidavit and by its vagueness. Appellants further argued that they were denied equal protection because the affidavit charged appellants with misdeeds instead of making individual attributions. The court reasoned that it was difficult to see how a recall movement could escape appellants' notice, and appellants waived the right to object to lack of notice by instituting this action. The provision allowing both appellants to be included on the recall affidavit was valid because it did not conflict with any other provisions of organic law and, thus, was a proper exercise of the legislature's plenary power over all municipalities. An act of the legislature was not to be struck down unless its invalidity was shown beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment upholding the constitutionality of the statute that provided a recall procedure under which appellees, a city and the city clerk, undertook to recall appellant councilmen. The court concluded that the lack of notice was valid or that appellants waived any objection to the lack of notice. Further, appellants failed to show the invalidity of the statute beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 731.07. Appellant sought to admit into probate a will under which she claimed to be a beneficiary. The probate court denied admission of the will, holding that because the will failed to contain two witness signatures, the will was invalid. Appellant sought review, claiming that the statute was unconstitutional because it thwarted the testator's right to dispose of his property. The court affirmed. Because the statute was enacted to ensure the validity of wills and to avoid fraud, the will could not be admitted because it did not meet the statutory requirements. The testator's right to dispose of his property upon death was properly restricted by statute where the legislature found the statute promoted good public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions and sentences of death were upheld because defendants failed to preserve issues for review and appellate jurisdiction was lacking. Defendants were convicted and sentenced to death. Defendants brought a motion to vacate, claiming they were denied due process and equal protection of law because the issue of guilt and recommendation to mercy were tried together. The trial court seemed to be under the impression that defendants were attacking the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 919.23, which permitted a jury to recommend mercy in a capital case. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statute and denied the motion. Defendants appealed, claiming that although the statute was constitutional, they were given an unfair trial. The court transferred the case to the lower appellate court, holding that because defendants failed to attack the trial court's decision of the statute's constitutionality on appeal, appellate jurisdiction was lacking. The trial court's ruling did not construe a controlling provision of the constitution, and no other constitutional issues were raised. Thus, appellate review was precluded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant placed an advertisement in a newspaper for the sale of an automobile and the advertisement contained false and misleading statements. Appellant was charged by information for violating Fla. Stat. ch. 817.41 for dissemination of false and misleading information. Appellant moved to quash the information and contended that the statute was vague, indefinite, and unconstitutional, and that appellee state failed to prove each element of the crime of false pretenses as prescribed under Fla. Stat. ch. 817.41. The trial court denied his motion and he appealed. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 817.41 was valid and enforceable against appellant. The court reasoned that the statute was not vague and the definition section of the statute and the penalty section of the statute were properly read together, as the legislature intended. Secondly, under Fla. Stat. ch. 817.41, appellee was only required to prove that appellant disseminated the false and misleading information, not that the purchaser relied upon those facts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sued for a declaratory decree contending that 1963 Fla.

The chancellor held that ch. 63-200 was valid, Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 16 did not irrevocably allocate the tax and in no way restricted the power of the legislature to change county lines, and that the distribution of the &quot;seventh cent&quot; would have to be made on the basis of new county areas established by ch. 63-200. Appellants sought review. The court affirmed the final decree of the chancellor. The court held that the boundary descriptions in ch. 63-200 were adequate. The court held that computations of tax allocable were not irrevocably fixed for 50 years. The court found that ch. 63-200 was not invalid and that legislative acts would not be held invalid because the legislature adopting them was unconstitutionally apportioned.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city attempted to grant significant tax exemptions to appellants developers and appellees, citizens in a class, sued claiming that the ordinances passed by appellant city to facilitate the contracts between appellants and the tax exemptions granted to developers were invalid and unenforceable. Appellees also sought to have taxes reassessed for the years prior to the suit. The court affirmed and held that the ordinances granting the exemptions were invalid, thereby rendering the contracts based upon the ordinances invalid and unenforceable. The court reasoned that the exemptions could only be granted by legislative authority and none existed. The court also held that, while the tax exemptions were for a valid municipal purpose, the supposed consideration for the contracts was speculative and incidental and primarily for the benefit of a private enterprise and not for the public benefit. The court did not grant the reassessment because appellees had failed to institute suit within the required 60 days.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's decision invalidating the granting of tax exemptions to appellants developers and rendering unenforceable the contracts between appellants city and developers was affirmed because there was no legislative authority granting appellant city the right to exempt the taxes. However, the decision denying the reassessment was also affirmed because appellees failed to challenge the assessment within the required 60 days.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a motion for reduction of sentence from death to life, which was denied. By his motion, appellant contended that Fla.

VIII., that Fla. Stat. ch. 794.01, was patently unconstitutional because it required the trial jury simultaneously to determine both guilt or innocence and the penalty, and Fla. Stat. ch. 794.01 was unconstitutional as applied to appellant. Appellant alleged that statistics revealed a pattern of discrimination against African Americans in the imposition of the death sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county development authority adopted a resolution to borrow $ 244,000 from the United States, and in evidence of the debt executed a 30-year installment promissory note for that amount. The indebtedness was incurred to aid in financing a rural development project. By the resolution, appellee was obligated to proceed at once to build rural home sites that upon completion were to be sold at appraised market value. Appellant state brought an action questioning whether appellee, as a representative of the community, could go into the business to get a benefit that it would obliquely receive if the project were that of private enterprise. The trial court found in favor of appellee, and appellant challenged. The court reversed, finding that appellee's actions were barred by Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 10, because the proposed development was not related to public health, public safety, public morals or public welfare.</SPAN></P>

Only those accumulations of refuse or vegetation that are within 200 feet of a &quot;structure&quot; could be found to be a nuisance as a health or fire hazard.

Appellant argued that Special Acts of 1953, 1953 Fla. Laws ch. 53-29279, which required that he be a freeholder elector for one year prior to qualifying for office, was invalid.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was elected to the office of city commissioner. His opponent, appellee, was granted a temporary order enjoining the city from swearing appellant in because he was not a freeholder elector of the city for one year prior to qualifying for office. Appellant argued that Fla. Const. art. VI, &sect; 5, which directed the legislature to exclude certain convicts from office, prohibited the legislature from establishing any other qualifications, by operation of the principle of expressio unius est exclusio alterius. The court disagreed. Neither precedent nor reason supported appellant's argument. Further, the use of the words &quot;alter or amend &quot; in Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 8 expressly authorized the changing of policy underlying municipal charters so that municipal officers could be chosen as statutes may enact. The legislature had the power to impose qualifications, and the qualification at issue was not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the crux of petitioners' complaint was that respondent authorized companies that came within the grandfather provisions of ch. 63-416, &sect;&sect; 4(b) and (c) to transport the materials without first making a showing of public convenience and necessity. The court ruled that the legislature actually determined public convenience and necessity because it patently found that all auto transportation companies that had been transporting the materials in dispute and that met the requirements of ch. 63-416, &sect;&sect; 5(a), (b) and (c), were essential to the public convenience and necessity for the state's growth explosion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporations challenged a chancellor's decision that found 1963 Fla. Acts ch. 527 to be constitutional. Chapter 527 levied taxes on sporting goods. Appellants argued that the title of the act was defective when measured by the requirement of Fla. Const. art. III &sect; 16, which required each law to address but one subject, to be briefly expressed in the title. The supreme court affirmed. The title was not sufficiently defective to render the law invalid. Appellants asserted that the chancellor erred in rejecting their contention that powers attempted to be vested in the Revenue Commission constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative powers because they were so vague as not to afford proper guidelines for the administrative body to follow. The court disagreed, holding that the purpose and language of the act encompassed the powers of the commission. Lastly appellants contended that the chancellor erred when he held that the act did not violate the equal protection and due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions. The court again upheld the law, noting that acts of the legislature were presumed valid unless proved otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the decision of the chancellor that declared a state law, which levied taxes on sporting equipment, to be constitutional. The title of the law sufficiently indicated the nature of its provisions, the law properly vested powers in a commission to enact the statute, and it did not violate the equal protection and due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bathing suit manufacturers sought reversal of a trial court decision holding Fla. Stat. ch. 63-527 (1963) to be constitutional. Appellants challenged the law on two grounds. They asserted that the title of the law was inadequate to meet the constitutional standards of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 16, because the title's reference to swimming equipment did not sufficiently indicate that bathing suits were covered by the provisions of the act. The supreme court noted that the purpose of the constitutional requirement was to avoid surprise by apprising the public of the subject of the legislation. The court found that the title gave reasonable notice concerning its contents. Appellants next contended that the act was discriminatory by exempting other articles of clothing from the tax. The court noted the state's broad power to select subjects of excise taxation, which were not to be disturbed unless they created an unequal result. If the act was found to be discriminatory, the language of the statute made clear that commodities otherwise exempted were to be taxed to eliminate the discrimination. Appellants' arguments were rejected and the court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

Further, should the act be determined to be discriminatory, the inclusion of other commodities originally exempted from the act would eliminate any unequal result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers filed a complaint against respondents, members of the state racing commission and dog track operators, seeking to have Fla. Stat. ch. 550.162 declared unconstitutional. Chapter 550.162 allowed a set deduction for operating costs before the computation of excise taxes to be paid by dog track operators. Appellants claimed ch. 550.162 contained a capricious and arbitrary classification for tax exemption purposes and discriminated against taxpayers who were not allowed a similar deduction for their businesses. The trial court dismissed the complaint, and appellants sought review of the order. On review, the supreme court affirmed, holding that the state legislature had the power to impose taxes upon the privilege of operating dog tracks and to determine the amount or percentage that was to be deducted from pari-mutuel pools. The court held that ch. 550.162 did not grant a tax exemption, but specified how the tax was to be computed. Further, the court found no arbitrary or unreasonable discrimination among the subject class, that of dog track operators, and found that ch. 550.162 was a proper and constitutional exercise of the legislative power and function.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 193.11(3) under the authority of a decision by the supreme court in a companion suit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee agricultural landowners brought an action against appellant tax assessor to invalidate and set aside the assessments of their lands. Appellees contended that appellant failed to comply with Fla. Stat. ch. 193.11(3) in making the assessments. Appellant defended his actions by alleging that the statute was invalid under Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1. Chapter 193.11(3) provided that all lands being used for agricultural purposes were to be assessed as agricultural lands upon an acreage basis, regardless of the fact that any or all of said lands were embraced in a plat, subdivision, or other real estate development. The Florida constitution directed the legislature to provide a uniform and equal rate of taxation and prescribe such regulations to secure a just valuation of all property. The court noted that the uniformity requirement pertained to the rate of taxation only and not to legislative regulations to secure just valuation. The organic requirement of Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 did not forbid classification of property in providing for just valuation of taxable property; thus, the court affirmed the lower court's decision, which upheld the validity of chapter 193.11(3).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute in question, which provided for the tax assessment of agricultural land, was a valid legislative classification designed to secure a just valuation of agricultural lands. The statute was valid under Florida's constitution, which required a uniform and equal rate of taxation to secure a just valuation of all property.</SPAN></P>

Appellants' petition was denied because they failed to show that ch. 63-964 was unconstitutional. In reversing the decision, the court held that ch. 63-964 violated provisions of Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 11. Under Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 11(5), (6), the legislature could not lawfully adopt an act that related only to a specific county. The fact that the act related to public transportation did not change such restriction on legislative power. The limitation that legislative action affecting the specific county had to also affect one or more other counties was necessary to insure that the legislature would not, after adoption of the home rule charter, continue to have the power to enact laws relating only to the specific county.</SPAN></P>

Under &sect; 768.06, appellant was compelled to stand its entire loss and pay to appellee 50 percent of its damages. A determination was made that the statute was immune to the attacks made by appellant, and appellant sought review. In reversing the decision, the court held that the statute was invalid under the due process and equal protection clauses of the federal constitution and Fla. Const. &sect; 12. To penalize appellant was wholly arbitrary and contrary to the principles of law respecting the constitutional right of equal protection. The subject regulated by the statute was the liability of a railroad for damage done to persons and property by the running of its trains. Any regulation designed to compel a high degree of care on the part of those persons or corporations who rendered a public service involving the safety of persons and property had to be applied with equal force upon all such persons of corporations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relators associations sought to have respondent comptroller refund to them certain excise liquor taxes paid and collected pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 561.46. Respondent filed a motion to quash petitioners writ for mandamus. In denying the motion to quash, the court held that ch. 561.46 was amended by 1961 Fla. Laws ch. 61-271. The amendment converted the excise tax of ch. 561.46 into a tax mandatorily payable by the purchaser or consumer. The amendment effectively transformed the former manufacturers' tax into a consumer's tax. The statutory language indicated a specific legislative intent to identify the taxpayer in the body of ch. 61-271. However, relators were instrumentalities of the federal government, and could not be made the subject of a state-imposed tax burden without congressional approval. Even if the statute was invalid, relators were still entitled to the relief sought because the money was collected by the state, when no taxes were due.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied respondent comptroller's motion to quash petitions writ of mandamus, holding under the statute, relators associations were entitled to a refund of the amount of the taxes paid by them. The court ruled that the taxes were direct consumer excise taxes while that act was in effect, and because relators were instrumentalities of the federal government, they were not subject to state taxation of the type involved.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 370.172(2). They made a motion to quash the information, arguing that the statute was unconstitutional. Their motion was denied, and they were sentenced to pay a fine of $ 500 each or serve six months in the county jail. Defendants sought review, arguing that the statute under which they were convicted was unconstitutional. In reversing the decision, the court held that the evidence indicated that the offense upon which defendants were convicted was not committed in Monroe County. The boundaries of Monroe County were defined as so much of the State of Florida as was situated south of the county of Collier and west and south of the county of Dade. In 1962, the boundaries of Florida were changed to include only a distance seaward of three geographic miles in the particular area, and the offense was committed beyond the boundary line. The failure of the State to prove that the crime was committed in the county where the trial took place was fatal. The court passed on determining the validity of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 61-648 &sect; 3 (1961), was constitutional in view of Fla. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 15. The statute created small claims courts having jurisdiction of cases at law where the demand did not exceed $ 300.00. The act further provided as many small claims courts in the county as there were justice of the peace districts, and that the person duly elected or appointed justice of the peace in each such district would act as judge of the small claims court. The court first held that the section of the statute regarding holding of more than one office was constitutional because the statute did not create two distinct offices in violation of the state constitution. The circuit court also certified the question of whether Fla. Stat. ch. 61-648 &sect; 2 (1961) was constitutional in view of Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 11(2). The court found that insofar as it attempted to set a jurisdictional limit in excess of $ 100.00, it must be stricken as unconstitutional because the constitution fixed the upper limits of justice of the peace jurisdiction at $ 100.00.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business owner sought an injunction against defendant for enforcing a municipal ordinance that affected his business. His complaint was dismissed, and plaintiff sought review. In affirming the decision, the court held that the complaint was without merit because of the absence of sufficient facts to make a good claim or to state a cause of action. To plead ideas or conclusions were permissible when applied to stated facts. Conclusions did not make a pleading bad, but served no useful purpose unless supported by facts shown in support of the conclusion. When appropriate facts were alleged, conclusions served a useful purpose in pointing out the inference intended to be relied on by the pleader, and the point of law upon which conclusions of law could be made, as applied to the facts. The provisions of the ordinance were not stated, nor was the city code or charter provisions stated.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part, holding it was not error to sustain defendant city's motion to dismiss or grant plaintiff business owner leave to file an amended complaint because plaintiff's complaint was not well pled. The court ruled that the complaint was not based on the manner of enforcement but the grounds that the ordinance was being enforced, which were grounds for invoking equity jurisdiction when the complaint was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. IX, section 16. The court affirmed the decree validating the certificates, first holding that the statute was constitutional because it merely authorized the interim use for a limited period of such accumulated surplus gas tax funds, pending the ultimate use in each county of the portion of such funds allocable to such county. The state also alleged that the statute was invalid because the members of the board of highway secondary funds trustees (board), created by the statute, were state officers who must be elected by the people or appointed by the Governor under the requirements of Fla.

The court said that notice and hearing, if desired by a licensee, were the least required before a liquor license could be suspended or revoked by the director and a landlord was entitled to no less before his premises were padlocked for use as a liquor establishment. The court reached the conclusion that the action of the state beverage director was not illegal.

Spec. Acts ch. 31182, &sect; 8(e), under which relief was sought.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, owners of submerged land in a bay, argued that appellee water authority erroneously required them to prove, before it would grant them a dredge and fill permit for the land, that there would be no adverse effect upon the public interest. Pointing to 1955 Fla. Spec. Acts ch. 31182, &sect; 8(e), the court observed that appellee failed to prove, as required, a material adverse effect in justifying its refusal. Consequently, the standard of proof contemplated by the statute was lacking, the court added. The state's sale of the land to appellants' predecessors carried with it the right to bulkhead and fill, subject to reasonable regulation by the state. Depriving appellants of a use of their property could be accomplished only if a material adverse effect on the public interest was proven; otherwise, the denial constituted a taking of private property without just compensation. If the public interest was impaired by the proposed use of appellants' property, the burden was on appellee to demonstrate that fact, the court ruled. Agreeing that the statute was constitutional, the court concluded that the denial to appellants of a permit constituted a wrongful taking of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment denying appellants' application for a dredge and fill permit for submerged land they owned in Boca Ciega Bay was quashed, because denial was improper when appellee water authority failed to prove, as statutorily required, adverse effect upon public interest by appellants' proposed use of property, as denial constituted a wrongful taking of property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of violating a state law that prohibited interracial couples from living together outside of marriage. Relying on controlling case law at the time, the court had held that the state law did not infringe on defendants' equal protection rights, reasoning that the statute was directed against the offense and not against a particular race. However, the United States Supreme Court subsequently found the state statute at issue constitutionally invalid, holding that the statute's prohibition was discriminatory. Thus, on remand, the court overturned its original validation of the statute and remanded the case for reversal of the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Acting under authority of Fla. Stat. ch. 171.04, appellant city passed an ordinance that declared appellant's intent to annex lands that were owned by appellee landowners, and appellees filed their objections with the lower court. The lower court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 171.04 was unconstitutional on the ground that it constituted an unlawful delegation of legislative power to the judiciary. The court stated that annexation was exclusively a legislative function, and in accordance with Fla. Const. art. II, could not have been delegated to or exercised by a non-legislative body such as the judiciary. The court stated that under Fla. Stat. ch. 171.04, when appellees filed objections, the lower court had unlimited power, governed by nothing more that its own discretion, to have decreed that the annexation should or should not have taken place. The court held that the court was given the power to have determined under what conditions the annexation should have taken place, which was a legislative power and function, and the power then to have decided whether the self-determined conditions have been met or shown to have existed. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee owners of house trailers had sought review of the validity of an ad valorem tax that was assessed by appellant tax assessor upon several house trailers. Pursuant to Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 13, motor vehicles were subject to only one form of taxation, which was a license tax for the operation of the motor vehicle and was in lieu of all ad valorem taxes that were assessable against motor vehicles as personal property. The court held there was nothing in the exemption statutes that brought house trailers into the class of constitutionally exempt motor vehicles. The court stated that the terms &quot;house trailer&quot; and &quot;housing accommodations&quot; imputed a connotation that was contrary to the status of an exempt motor vehicle. The court held when it read Fla. Stat. chs. 200.45 and 320.081 and Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 13 together, it held that a license tag was to have been purchased when the house trailer was primarily used as a motor vehicle; however, as long as it was used primarily for non-transportation purposes, it was taxed as personal property. Judgment of the lower court was reversed as far as Fla. Stat. chs. 200.45 and 320.081 purport to have granted exemptions to house trailers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the lower court was reversed. Appellant tax assessor was not precluded from taxing house trailers that were used primarily as housing accommodations as personal property, however if the house trailer was used primarily for transportation then the vehicle was exempt from these taxes and only required license tags.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Complainant Florida Bar filed a complaint against respondent attorney that alleged he had misappropriated a client's funds. Under oath, respondent confessed that he was guilty and that he had not made full restitution of the money that he converted to his own use. He then claimed immunity in the disciplinary proceeding under Fla. Stat. ch. 932.29. Respondent argued that, by admitting to the circuit judge that he was guilty of larceny, he immunized himself from disbarment. The referee recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year. Instead, complainant's Board of Governors disbarred him permanently and ordered him to pay the costs of the proceeding. On appeal, the court held that the statute did not immunize members of the bar from disciplinary proceedings because only the judicial branch had the constitutional power to discipline attorneys. The court found respondent guilty of the violations and found no mitigating circumstances that justified a sanction less than permanent disbarment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment that permanently disbarred respondent attorney from the practice of law and ordered him to pay the costs of the proceedings was affirmed. The court rejected respondent's argument that he was statutorily immune from disciplinary proceedings because only the judicial branch was constitutionally authorized to discipline attorneys.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the award and the District Court of Appeal, Third District, transferred the case to the court.

The court held that the broad language of the policy which employed the word &quot;alighting,&quot; coupled with appellee's testimony that while alighting from the small car he was compelled to turn his body twisting his back and immediately suffered an accidental injury, did not appear to justify reversing the jury's findings on the ground that as a matter of law there was no accident or injury under the terms of the policy. Also, Fla. Stat. ch. 627.0127 was not unconstitutional. Appellant was not entitled to a jury trial for determination of attorneys' fees because such a right did not exist under common law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner water company sought a writ of mandamus after respondents, utility commission and its members, rejected petitioner's application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity to operate a water company within the corporate limits of a certain county pursuant to 1959 Fla. Laws ch. 59-372 (the general act). Respondents claimed that they did not have jurisdiction over water and sewer utilities in the county at issue because the state legislature, through 1959 Fla. Laws ch. 59-1958 (the special act), removed from them regulatory jurisdiction over private water companies operating in the county. Respondents asserted that the special act instead gave jurisdiction to the county board of commissioners. The state supreme court held that just because the legislature carved out of the general act by the special act the authority of respondents to regulate private water companies in unincorporated areas of the county did not render nugatory the remaining provisions of the general act. Thus, the court concluded, respondents had a duty to honor petitioner's application. Therefore, the court denied respondents' motion to quash and granted a peremptory writ.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that in one prior decision, it had expressed no view on the issue of whether the connection of a building to the sanitary sewer system then under construction was plumbing, within the contemplation of Fla.

The court further noted that persons licensed to install septic tanks who passed an examination as a prerequisite to installing such connections and whose work was subject to city inspection, as well as master and journeyman plumbers, were lawfully authorized to perform such work under a city ordinance and that the ordinance that was not offensive to ch. 469.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and the issuance of the preemptory writ. The court ruled that the trial court properly construed prior case law when it held that the method used by appellant tax assessor of fixing the valuation of property within the county that was subject to ad valorem taxes, whereby appellant tax assessor placed such property on the tax roll at percent of the just valuation ascertained by him, was contrary to law and was discriminatory. The trial court reasoned, and the court agreed, that such a method increased the homestead exemption fixed by the Florida Constitution, and wholly exempted over 35,000 homesteads placed on the tax roll and reduced the taxes of all parcels of homestead exemptions, thereby requiring other property in appellant county to bear the tax burden that justly rested upon parcels which had the benefit of homestead exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were convicted of unlawful assembly, a violation of a municipal ordinance, and they sought review of their conviction. Questions were certified from the United States Supreme Court to determine the jurisdictional issue. The court stated that the judgment that affirmed petitioners conviction was subject to review by the district court by petition for a common law writ of certiorari pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 5(3). The writ was issued in the sound discretion of a superior court directed to an inferior court in order to determine from the record whether the lower court exceeded its jurisdiction or deviated from the essential requirements of the law. The scope of review was limited to an exploration of the record to determine if supporting evidence was totally lacking, and would not be expanded by the reviewing court to attempt a re-evaluation of the probative weight of the evidence. Under Florida precedents, the affirming judgment did not construe, but rather, applied federal constitutional provisions, and would have been subject to review by the district court of appeal by a petition for a common law writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In answering the certified questions, the court ruled that petitioners did not exhaust Florida's available appellate remedies and the judgment that affirmed petitioners conviction was not rendered by the highest court in Florida. The court held that the judgment could have been tested by the federal constitutional claims in the Florida District Court of Appeal provided that all of such claims were &quot;indisputably properly preserved.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision of the trial court that found Fla. Stat. ch. 63-1689 and ch. 63-1697 unconstitutional, and entered a decree that validated refunding bonds as requested by appellee gas district. In affirming the decision, the court held that the statutes were ineffective to prevent the validation of the bonds. Chapters 63-1689 and 63-1697 purported to regulate the activities of appellee in a fashion that would affect its operations in two counties, and notice of intention to introduce the legislation should have been published in both counties. The bonds were being refunded to accomplish lower rates of interest and to establish an open end pari passu provision that would make possible future improvements within the terms of the present resolution without the necessity of another new financing program. The new issue would result in a substantial reduction in interest rates and that the 1963 bonds were subject to much more attractive call provisions. Further, there was a net overall saving to appellee and the new issue would carry much less restrictive requirements for future pari passu bonds to finance improvements and capital extensions.</SPAN></P>

The court granted appellees' motion to dismiss. Appellants challenged this motion. Appellants argued that ch. 550.37 involved arbitrary and non-generic classifications. The court disagreed and held that the classifications were not arbitrary and generic. Appellants argued that the classification of counties into which operations could be transferred was invalid. The court ruled the classifications were constitutional because of their prospective applicability.

On appeal, the court found correct petitioner's claim that the provision was unconstitutional because the formula did not secure just valuation of closely-held corporate stock and resulted in discriminatory treatment of that stock. The court reversed and remanded because, insofar as it applied to closely-held stocks, Fla. Stat.

The court reversed the order of the circuit court dismissing appellant's writ of alternative mandamus, finding that the organic requirements for a uniform and equal rate of taxation and just valuation did not forbid proper classification of property in making just valuations. The court found no legal bar to taxation of intangible personal property in a category separate and apart from the taxation of other property so long as the classification was not arbitrary or unreasonable when all under like conditions were treated the same.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an armored car service, sought reversal of an order of the trial court dismissing their complaint for declaratory decree, alleging Fla.

Const. art. III, &sect; XVI.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both appellant and appellee operated armored car services. After Fla. Stat. ch. 323.08(3) was amended, appellee was allowed to domicile its equipment is a greater geographical area than before, enabling it to compete more directly with appellant in those areas. Appellant then sought reversal of an order of the trial court dismissing their complaint for a declaratory decree, and holding Fla. Stat. ch. 323.08(3) as amended was constitutional. The court found no merit to appellant's argument that the statute violated the due process and equal protection provisions of the state constitution and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because appellant had no vested property rights at stake, and therefore there was no notice or hearing requirement of which appellant was deprived. The court likewise found no merit in appellant's argument that the amended statute contained two separate and unrelated subjects in violation of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; XVI, because the only subject matter of the statute was armored car services, and appellant offered no evidence to the contrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, a Metropolitan Court judge, brought an action against appellants, mayor and Dade County Board of County Commissioners, which sought declaratory judgment that the Home Rule Amendment, Fla.

The trial court chancellor decreed that the charter amendment was a valid and constitutional enactment, except as it vacated the offices of incumbent judges contrary to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 24. Appellants challenged the decree. The court ruled that Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 11 created the Metropolitan Court and provided the jurisdiction's voters with sovereignty over that court. The court ruled that art. VIII, &sect; 11 could neither be controlled by nor be deranged by Fla. Const. art. V. The court ruled that because the Metropolitan Court was of legislative origin, it was governed by the electorate's determinations. Therefore, the court reversed the trial court chancellor's ruling under art. V, &sect; 24 and held constitutional, under art.

The court held that a setoff was only allowed when enhancements to the remaining tracts of land are special or local and result directly and peculiarly to that particular tract. The court held that the setoff would not have been allowed given that the enhancements were to the community and not directly to the remaining tract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owner filed a complaint for equitable relief after his application for a variance permit to erect a gasoline filling station on his property was denied. He sought review of the determination that the 30 day limitation provided by Fla. Stat. ch. 176.16 was applicable to a chancery proceeding, and that he failed to file a petition for certiorari to review the adverse decision of respondent city commission within 30 days of the decision. In reversing the decision, the court held that the determination that ch. 176.16 was mandatory was erroneous, and petitioner was not precluded the filing of the equity complaint more than 30 days after the adverse action of respondent. Chapter 176.16 delegated zoning powers to cities but was not applicable unless respondent elected to utilize it. Respondent proceeded under its special charter powers, rather than ch. 176. The complaint was a direct attack on the validity of the zoning ordinance itself, as applied to petitioner's property. As a result, even if ch. 176 were otherwise held to be applicable, the statutory certiorari proceeding would not have been available to accomplish the results desired.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court quashed the decision of the lower court, holding it was error to determine that the statute was mandatory because the terms of the statute indicated it was not mandatory.

Moreover, respondent city suffered no prejudice from respondent utility's failure to separate the notice of rate changes from its explanation of reasons therefor. Substantial compliance resulted when a composite document was submitted. And an engineer's report appraising the utility's property was properly admitted into evidence when no objection was made to respondent commission. That the engineer was statutorily required to set the utility's fair value in determining the rate base did not give him exclusive power, as the report was merely a starting point in establishing valuation. With respect to the allowed rates, the court found that consideration had been given to the public interest, as required, as well as to the needs of respondent utility. And when utility service was unaffected, a rate producing less than a fair return to respondent utility was proper. While legislative standards for determining reasonable rates might operate unfairly to respondent utility's benefit, all parties were legislatively bound.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Order of respondent commission authorizing increases in water and sewer rates requested by respondent utility approved, because respondent commission satisfied requirements of law in approving rate change, as composite application document justifying request was in substantial compliance, as rate producing less than fair return to respondent utility was proper when service was unaffected, and as consideration was given to public interest.</SPAN></P>

Cross-appellant sought review of the decision that refused an injunction against the continued functioning of appellee Budget Commission. The court held that the chancellor acted within his jurisdiction when he proceeded to consider applicable statutes other than those assaulted by the complaint. Although the attack was directed at three particular statutes, the fact remained that if the Commission was authorized by another statute, the chancellor acted properly in recognizing the latter. The court could not disregard the judicial knowledge it had regarding Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee instituted a suit to set aside a sheriff's deed. Appellants asserted that the application of Fla. Stat. ch. 631.201 to contracts entered into before the effective date of the statute was unconstitutional. The validity of the statute was passed upon, and appellant sought review. In reversing the decision, the court held that remedies available under ch. 631.201 were inadequate substitutes for those that were available to appellants at the time of the contract. Because nothing in the statute required retroactive application, it was construed to operate prospectively only. The legislature, under the guise of modifying the remedy, could not impair the obligation of a contract, nor impair substantial rights secured by contract. The law in force at the time the insurance contract was entered into provided means for the enforcement within the state. The effective curtailment of all remedies for enforcement of a Florida judgment based on breach of a contract entered into prior to enactment of the statute constituted an impairment of contract prohibited by U.S. Const. art 1, ch. 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision that found that the application of the statute did not impair the obligation of the contract entered into between the parties, holding the remedies available under the statute were inadequate substitutes for those available to appellants at the time of the contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant indigent filed a motion to vacate commitment pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 924 following his guilty pleas to the several misdemeanors charged against him. His motion was denied and he sought review. In affirming the decision, the court held the legislature provided for a public defender to represent indigent defendants in all non-capital felony cases. By limiting the scope of ch. 924 to felonies, the Legislature had declared the public policy of Florida to be that persons accused of misdemeanors only did not necessarily require the appointment of counsel to assist in their defense. The court found that nothing in the applicable case law indicated conclusively that the requirement of court appointed counsel was intended to apply to all crimes, misdemeanors as well as felonies, traffic violations, and any infraction of the law for which one was haled into court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of appellant's motion to vacate commitment and held that there was nothing in the Florida Constitution nor in the United States Constitution that required that an indigent defendant should have court appointed counsel to defend him on a misdemeanor charge, and that under the applicable statute, persons accused of misdemeanors only did not necessarily require the appointment of counsel to assist in their defense.</SPAN></P>

IX, &sect; 15 to appellant for the purposes of constructing water and sewer facilities in unincorporated areas, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a county water and sewer district, was created by 1957 Fla. Laws ch. 57-1624, Sp.

Laws ch. 59-589, which gave appellant part of part of the county's annual funds that it received from race track parimutuel betting pursuant to Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 15 was enacted, appellee county commissioners sued appellees board of county commissioners to enjoin them from paying appellant. The chancellor held that ch. 59-589 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the title to ch. 59-589 was specific enough to meet the requirements of the state constitution. Because ch. 57-1624 and 59-589 dealt with the same subject matter, they had to be read in pari materia, and when read together the procedures for the expenditure of funds were clearly defined. Because ch. 59-589 provided that the funds were to be used to build water and sewer lines in the unincorporated areas of the county, which was a valid county purpose, the act did not divert county funds and was thus constitutional. Therefore, the court reversed the holding of the chancellor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation filed a complaint against appellee county officials attacking the validity of the county assessment of appellants property for ad valorem taxing purposes. It was held that the tender of the amount legally due could not be made beyond the 60 day period prescribed by Fla. Stat. ch. 192.21, the validity of Fla. Stat. ch. 196.01 was upheld, and appellant's complaint was dismissed with prejudice. Appellant sought review. The court held that the statutory requirement of a tender was met if the tender was made as a condition to relief, which could be accomplished beyond the 60 day period for filing the suit. The legislature never intended that the deposit of the amount of taxes conceded to be legally due was a jurisdictional prerequisite that was to be made during the 60 day period allowed for the filing of the complaint. Section 196.01 was construed as a legislative condition to granting relief as distinguished from a condition to filing suit.

Appellants filed a motion for directed verdict which argued the statute violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 21. The trial court denied this motion and convicted and sentenced appellants. The district court and the court both affirmed the trial court's decision. Appellants brought and the court granted a motion for rehearing. Appellants argued the trial court erred in denying their directed verdict motion. Appellants asserted that ch. 370.172(3) violated art. III, &sect; 21 because it improperly criminalized mere possession by failing to require any proof of illegal intent for unlawful use. Appellants noted that because the equipment could be used for lawful purposes, the statute was overbroad. The court agreed and held the law unconstitutional only insofar as it criminalized mere possession, because that unreasonably interfered with individual liberty in a manner unnecessary to protect the public. The court reversed appellants' conviction and sentence in all prior court decisions.</SPAN></P>

Appellant county manager ousted appellee summarily and without notice. The court concluded that appellant county, under its charter and pertinent ordinances, had the power to abolish the office of county sheriff, to hire appellee on a daily basis to serve at the will of the appellant, and to fire him without cause or notice. Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 11(1) provided that the county electors had the power to adopt a home rule charter which could abolish all offices provided for by Fla. Const. art.

The Dade County, Fla., Charter &sect; 3.04(B) provided the right to suspend, remove, or discharge any department head, with or without cause, to the county manager.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was charged with murder in the first degree, committed when he was 17 years old. In an attempt to avoid the death penalty, his attorney convinced him to stipulate to the facts. The jury found him guilty of first degree murder and recommended no mercy. He was sentenced to death. The sentence was affirmed on appeal, and petitioner filed for a writ of habeas corpus. The court found that the court appointed counsel were experienced criminal lawyers. Petitioner and his counsel hoped for leniency in the form of a mercy recommendation. There was no evidence in the record that counsel had guaranteed leniency. Their hopes were evidently decimated by the clear showing of murder, portrayed by the bare facts uncolored by pictures and other condemning evidence. The stipulation was a tactical maneuver joined in by the petitioner and his family with full knowledge of the risk assumed. The court also found that petitioner's age was not an element of the crime. Maturity sufficient to form the required intent was all that was essential.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied petitioner's request for a writ of habeas corpus and determined that he had knowingly waived his constitutional rights in stipulating to the facts in the hope of gaining leniency, upon the advice of competent counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants moved for a temporary injunction on the basis of allegations in a complaint. Arguments were heard on the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 562.131 (1961). The court denied the temporary restraining order and decreed that the statute was constitutional and a valid exercise of police power of appellee State of Florida. Appellants sought review of the judgment. Appellants contended that ch. 562.131 placed an undue burden on interstate commerce, constituted a deprivation of property without due process of law, and impaired the obligation of contract. Appellee countered that ch. 562.131 had to do with the regulation of the liquor traffic. Therefore the power of the legislature to protect the health, morals, safety, and general welfare of the community was without limit so long as reasonable. The court concluded that the test to determine the issue was whether they have some actual and reasonable relation to the maintenance and promotion of the public health and welfare, and whether such was in fact the end sought to be attained. The court affirmed the judgment. The act under review met the test that established it as a valid exercise of its police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, a city and its officials, sought review of a decision of the First District, District Court of Appeal, (Florida) for respondent widow, relator. The district court certified as a decision of great public interest whether a retired public employee or his contingent beneficiary had a vested or contractual right in a public pension plan so as not to be effected by subsequent legislation affecting the contingent beneficiary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state legislature enacted legislation that an employee receiving a pension could, within six months of the effective date of newly enacted legislation restricting contingent beneficiary payments, exercise an option to take a reduced pension and have a certain amount paid upon his death to anyone he named who had an insurable interest in his life, and that any payments then being made to a widow should not be interrupted. In this case, the decedent husband failed to select any option and later died. Respondent widow brought a writ of mandamus that was quashed in the trial court but reversed in the appeals court. Petitioners, a city and its officials, sought review of the appeals court decision for respondent to retain 75 percent of her husband's pension benefits as a contingent beneficiary and certifying as a question of great public interest whether or not a retired public employee or his contingent beneficiary had a vested or contractual right in a public pension plan so as not to be effected by subsequent legislation. The court applied case law stating that the right of the employee-husband vested at the time he actually retired, and affirmed the judgment for respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appeals court decision for respondent widow, concluding that the right of the widow vested simultaneously with that of her husband and was not impaired by the amendatory act. Therefore, a contingent beneficiary had a vested or contractual right in a pension plan that vested when the primary beneficiary's rights vested, and that right was not affected by subsequent legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city passed an ordinance that prohibited operators of lodging accommodations from using outdoor signs to advertise accommodation rates. Petitioner motel owners sued to enjoin enforcement of the ordinance. The trial court upheld the ordinance as a valid exercise of police power, and the appellate court affirmed. Petitioners sought further review. The court held that the ordinance was not a valid exercise of police power because the ordinance was discriminatory and did not have a reasonable relationship to the general welfare. There was no aesthetic justification for the ordinance because all other motel advertising signs were permissible and a sign advertising rates was not distinguishable from a sign advertising other aspects of a motel's services. Further, other businesses in the area were allowed to advertise rates for their services. The court found that the ordinance improperly restricted competition between luxury motels and other motels. Because the court determined that the ordinance was unconstitutional, the appellate decision sustaining its validity was quashed.</SPAN></P>

Fla. Laws ch. 61-581 and 1961 Fla. Laws ch. 61-1493 dealt with the amount of compensation and the reimbursement of costs to which appellant was entitled. The circuit court held that both Fla.

Laws ch. 63-1310, affecting the election of councilmen and the mayor of appellee city, contending it was invalid. Appellants intervened. The chancellor found the statute to be unconstitutional. Intervenors appealed, arguing the statute adequately reflected a clear legislative intent and that certain words which were inadvertently omitted could be inserted to effectuate its intent. The court agreed. It found that the intent of the statute was clear. In holding that the judicial obligation was to sustain statutes, if possible, the court ruled that it would supply the omitted words. The court also found that the provision did not nullify the city's participation in the county permanent voter registration system, but expanded the city's. Thus, the statute was cumulative. Finding the subject provision no broader than its tile, the court found the statute constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator faced prosecution on an information charging him with perjury before the grand jury. Relator sought a writ of prohibition directed to respondent, one of the criminal court judges in the court in which he faced prosecution. Relator asserted that respondent was without jurisdiction over the matter because the alleged false swearing occurred before a grand jury which was illegally constituted because 1949 Fla. Laws ch. 25554, the statute under which the number of grand jurors was determined, and 1957 Fla. Laws ch. 57-550, the statute under which the grand jurors were selected, were both rendered invalid by the passage of other acts. The court held that it was relator's burden to establish all of the facts alleged. Therefore, because relator did not establish in the record the fact that the grand jury was organized and selected pursuant to ch. 2554, and ch. 57-550, nor did it reflect when the grand jury was organized, relator failed to meet his burden to establish those facts. Further, the state refused to stipulate to the existence of any of the missing facts, and respondent denied many of those facts in his return to the rule nisi. Accordingly, the rule nisi was discharged.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that because the trial court enjoined enforcement of a statute against plaintiffs where the statute clearly defined plaintiffs under ch. 408.01(1) as persons subject to its terms, the trial court passed on the validity of a statute, and the court had jurisdiction pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V. &sect; 4. The court held that because the educational requirements were unrelated to the competent performance of plaintiffs' limited activities in their establishments, there was no reasonable relationship between the educational requirements of the statute and the public health or welfare. Therefore, the definitions of applicability of ch. 408.01(1) were not susceptible of lawful limitation and were thus invalid. Therefore, the court affirmed the decree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following federal court decisions that determined that the Florida constitutional and statutory provisions which established apportionment and reapportionment were unconstitutional, the governor sought advice on his authority to call recurring sessions of the state legislature until reapportionment was accomplished. The court concluded that, in view of the pronounced urgency, the governor was justified in seeking advice regarding his powers and duties. The court determined that the governor was authorized to call recurring sessions. The federal court decisions clearly voided the provisions prospectively. Regardless of the federal court's jurisdiction to render the opinion, it had the power to enforce its judgment in this cause. The federal court orders eliminated the Florida statutory and constitutional organic limitations on the size of the state house and senate, and pursuant to Fla. Const. art. IV, &sect; 8, the governor had the authority to continue calling extra sessions until a reapportionment bill was enacted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor's request for an advisory opinion was granted, and the court determined that the governor was authorized under the state constitution to call continuous sessions of the state legislature until such time as a reapportionment bill was enacted in conformity with the federal constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee architect entered into a contract with appellant real property owners to provide architectural services for the construction of a residence. The contract stipulated that appellee would receive specified percentages of the construction costs as compensation. Disagreements arose over the design and other factors related to the project. Ultimately, appellee filed a claim of lien against the property, claiming that unpaid architectural fees were due. The trial court denied appellants' request for a jury trial on the issues presented by their counterclaim, and the appellate court upheld the order. The supreme court reversed, holding that when a timely jury demand was made, the filing of a compulsory counterclaim for relief cognizable at law in an action for equitable relief did not constitute the counter-claimant's waiver of the right to a jury trial. Also, in suits at common law, the right of trial by jury was to be preserved. The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, the tax assessor and an intervening party challenging the circuit court's ruling, sought review before the supreme court. The supreme court affirmed the circuit court's judgment, holding that the statute was unconstitutional because assessment of stock in trade at one-fourth of invoice cost was plainly not based upon any reasonable relationship to the just or true value of such property in the hands of the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

Indenture provisions setting aside bond proceed amounts necessary to meet interest requirements for 54 months after their delivery were valid and legal under Fla.

Appellants claimed that Rule 2 was a valid exercise of the regulatory powers granted to appellants by ch. 465. The court held that the lower court ruled correctly in finding ch. 465 unconstitutional because the statute purported to restrict the right of an affected party to attack the validity of the quasi-legislative rule, Rule 2, which had been entered without notice or hearing. The validity of Rule 2 did not bear a reasonable relationship to public safety, health, morals, and general welfare.

The requested injunctive relief was granted by the lower court. In considering the jurisdictional question, the court found no place in the lower court's decree in which the chancellor undertook to explain, define, or otherwise eliminate existing doubts arising from the language or terms of any constitutional provision. Rather than speculate as to whether the decree did or did not hold portions of Fla. Stat. ch. 480 to be unconstitutional and whether or not it had jurisdiction of the cause, the court determined not to decide the question of jurisdiction, but rather, it temporarily relinquished control of the cause to the chancellor. His sole direction was to enter an order setting forth whether he directly passed upon the validity of the statute, or any portion thereof, and if so, what portions were held valid or invalid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner filed a writ of certiorari for review an order of respondent, Florida Railroad and Public Utilities Commission, which denied an application for transfer of an auto transportation brokerage license.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner owned an auto transportation brokers (ATB) license that he sought to assign. One witness protested the transfer. The hearing examiner filed a recommended order granting the transfer application. Respondent commission eventually issued an order revoking its former orders and denying the transfer because it found petitioner, as transferee, had held itself out as an auto transportation broker without having previously obtained a license though there was no conviction of that offense as required by statute. The transfer of an ATB license was provided for under Fla. Stat. Ann. ch. 323.31(6). The court examined ch. 323.31(6) and eliminated part of the statute that stated that commission could reasonably alter, restrict, or modify the terms and provisions of a license or restrictions on transfer where the public interest may be served as being unconstitutional. The court found that respondent commission deviated from the law in rejecting the recommendations of the hearing examiner and in refusing to approve the transfer of the petitioner's license given there was no conviction.

The state appealed and defendant cross-appealed. The state then filed a motion to dismiss the cross appeal. The appellate court held that the motion to dismiss was lacking in merit and relinquished jurisdiction to the trial court with directions to amend the order on the motion to quash so as to specify its ruling on the validity of ch. 836.05. In compliance, the trial court ruled that ch. 836.05 was not unconstitutionally vague or invalid. Thereafter, the state sought review of the trial court's decision regarding the validity of ch. 836.05. The reviewing court returned the case to the appellate court. The court stated that the ruling as to the validity of ch. 836.05 was not a final judgment because it was one of the two cases still pending, and, hence, the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court held that 1951 Fla. Laws ch. 27438 (Act), under which appellee was suspended, was invalid and unconstitutional on its face. The circuit court reasoned that the statute conferred an arbitrary power on appellant's board of commissioners to determine when and how the best interests of the patients and appellant would be best served without providing sufficiently definite standards for the guidance of the board and staff members affected. On appeal, the court found that it was at least arguable that statutes vesting authority in a hospital board to control medical staff membership were essentially distinguishable from and needed contain less specific standards than laws delegating power to a professional or occupational licensing board. The court held that the Act adequately stated a standard by which the propriety of exclusions or suspensions of physicians from hospital staffs could be measured, and that granting of injunctive relief on the sole ground of statutory fatal insufficiency was in error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff's husband was killed in an accident while he was employed by defendant. Plaintiff sued defendant for negligently failing to provide her husband with a safe place to work. Defendant alleged that jurisdiction over him under Fla. Stat. ch. 47.162 was unconstitutional. The supreme court ruled that the statute was not a restraint of interstate commerce or violative of due process and held that it was a valid exercise of the state's police power to protect its citizens and others within its borders. Furthermore, the supreme court found that defendant had the requisite minimum contacts with the forum so that the suit was not a denial of due process and did not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. The accident took place at a time when defendant's tugboat was being operated within the forum state. Defendant failed to furnish the decedent a safe means to board and leave the tug. The supreme court found that the evidence when considered in the light most favorable to plaintiff, made a prima facie showing that negligence on the part of defendant played a part in causing the death of plaintiff's decedent. Accordingly, judgment for plaintiff was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment for plaintiff widow was affirmed. The statute under which jurisdiction over defendant was established did not violate due process rights, did not restrain interstate commerce, and provided a valid police power under which the state protected interests of its citizens and others within its borders, and the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant negligently failed to provide plaintiff's husband with a safe place to work.</SPAN></P>

Appellants contended that the statute offended &sect; 20 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of Florida that concerned the right of people to bear arms in defence of themselves, except for the Legislature's ability to prescribe the manner in which arms could be borne. Appellants placed great stress on the proviso that excluded sheriffs and other law enforcement agencies. The court affirmed the judgment of the criminal court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a trial court judgment that upheld the constitutionality of a local act requiring written notice of tort claims against appellee city as a condition precedent to suit and dismissed appellant's complaint. Appellant asserted the local act was unconstitutional in light of the court's recent decision limiting the doctrine of municipal immunity. The court disagreed and stated that the rule remained valid that in order to state a cause of action against a city for damages for personal injuries, a complaint was required to specifically allege that the required notice of claim was given. The court held the decision cited by appellant did not destroy in toto many of the basic differences between private and municipal corporations. In support of its holding, the court cited the recent passage by the legislature of Fla. Stat. ch. 95.241 (1961) that was a general act requiring a written notice of claim of an action in tort against a municipality and that specifically provided that local acts on the same subject remained valid and effective.

Upon remand, the court stated that it was required to analyze the decision of the Supreme Court in order to determine whether it had completely nullified the requirements of &sect; 876.05 or whether it had held invalid merely a portion of the statute. The court held that when the portion of the statute declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court was eliminated, the balance of the act remained in full force and effect because the remainder was a valid, coherent, workable statute which the legislature would have enacted into law absent the invalid language. The court therefore reversed the order of the chancellor in the underlying case to the extent that it approved the objectionable language but affirmed the decree to the extent that it upheld the remainder of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant property owners brought suit seeking injunctive relief against appellee flood control district. Appellants sought to enjoin further assessments or expenditures on behalf of the district and a refund of moneys on hand obtained through the levy of an annual uniform ad valorem tax on all property located within the district. After the trial court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a cause of action, appellants sought review. Appellants alleged that the levy authorized by Fla. Stat. ch. 25270 was not in proportion to the benefits conferred and was therefore an unconstitutional taking of private property without just compensation. The court disagreed and held that the legislature had the authority to assess taxes for public improvements for a common public benefit to a taxing unit as a whole. Appellants also alleged the tax violated Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 (1940) which proscribed ad valorem taxes upon real property for state purposes. The court refused to consider the issue because the purposes for which the levy was authorized were district or local as opposed to state. The court therefore affirmed the decree of the trial court dismissing appellants' complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of an interlocutory order that sustained a motion to dismiss their complaint. In the complaint, appellants challenged the validity of two portions of Fla. Stat. ch. 59-1356 that established appellee county aviation authority. Appellants alleged the statute violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 20, which prohibited the passage of local laws regulating the jurisdiction and duties of any class of officers and local laws for assessment and collection of taxes for State and county purposes. The court held that as long as the purpose served was a public one, there was no constitutional prohibition against the establishment of special improvements districts and county development authorities. Further, the court held that local laws that authorized a particular tax for a particular local purpose were not prohibited and that the incidental involvement of county officers was not unconstitutional as long as the county agency was established by local law to serve a proper county purpose.

The trial court upheld the validity of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 98.201, 101.59 (1959) and dismissed the elector's mandamus proceedings against the supervisor to compel the restoration of his name to the list of qualified voters.</SPAN></P>

The supervisor denied the elector's application under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 98.291 (1959) for the restoration of his name to the books even after he gave the requisite proof that his name was improperly removed. The court agreed with the elector's contention that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 98.201, 101.59 (1959) were unconstitutional and void for failing to comply with the essential elements of due process in U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV, and &sect; 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Florida Constitution. The court decided that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 98.201, 101.59 (1959) failed to provide the elector a notice and an opportunity to be heard before striking his name from the registration list. The court ruled that an elector had a personal right to have his name remain on the list for the period prescribed by law. The court decided that the trial court reached an incorrect conclusion based on a false premise. The court found no principle or authority providing that one's name could be stricken from a registration list without notice and an opportunity to be heard.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a final decree the court validated and confirmed turnpike revenue bonds, to be used by appellee state turnpike authority to redeem a previous issue, to construct an additional portion of the authorized project and to reimburse a corporation for expenditures advanced in the construction of an interchange. Appellants contended that the finding of the lower court that a portion of an interstate was not in the same traffic corridor as the turnpike project was not supported by substantial competent evidence. This contention arose out of a resolution adopted by appellee concerning the Trust Indenture. The court found that controversy about the Trust Indenture was not germane to the question of the validity of the proposed issue of revenue bonds. Appellants further contended that appellee would be required to make an illegal, unlawful, and unconstitutional expenditure if bond proceeds were used for the reimbursement. The court held that the financing and construction of this interchange in the manner in which it was done and the necessity therefor was purely an administrative matter involving business judgment and discretion of appellee. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the decrees of the circuit court. The court held that the circuit court was in error in adjudicating &sect; 324.021 et seq. to be unconstitutional. The court held that there were numerous means within the law by which a person could relieve himself or herself from the inconvenience of having his automobile license revoked. The court held that a method of review was provided by rules of practice and procedure in the state courts. Therefore, the court held that while provision for notice was not carried in the body of the challenged act, if notice was required, it was amply provided for in the judicial structure of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, the tax collector and tax assessor of a particular county and the state comptroller, argued that the sale of electricity by appellee city to inhabitants outside the city and in the particular county was not a municipal purpose and, thus, appellee's utility property was subject to taxation. The court disagreed, pointing to previous rulings that the furnishing of electricity was a municipal purpose, and that the purpose did not change merely because residents outside the city were served. Because furnishing of electricity to residents of another county was earlier held to be a municipal purpose served by appellee, provision of this service to the particular county was also a municipal purpose, the court stated. Rejecting the contention that amendments to Fla. Stat. ch. 192.06(2) and 192.52 made such a ruling inapplicable to the utility property in the county at issue, the court found nothing in the provisions that would force it to conclude that the tax exemption provisions in these statutes applied only to the county outside the city, or that any meaningful distinction existed between &quot;public&quot; and &quot;municipal&quot; purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment affirmed voiding taxes assessed by appellants, the tax collector and tax assessor of a particular county and the state comptroller, on utility property of appellee city located in the particular and enjoining appellants from future attempts at assessing or seeking payment of taxes on this property, as provision of electricity by appellee to residents outside city remained a &quot;municipal purpose&quot; that entitled appellee to tax exemption.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that even though the questions presented might be moot, the case was of sufficient importance and public interest to retain jurisdiction and determine the unsettled questions. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 87.13 (1959) was not inhibitory so as to prevent the maintenance of this action for declaratory decree. The court held that 1959 Fla.

The court held that 1945 Fla. Laws ch. 22604 and 1953 Fla. Laws ch. 28450 were unconstitutional and void due to the restrictive application to particular counties immediately involved within the population bracket and no others. The court held that 1955 Fla.

On appeal, defendant argued that the statutes were unconstitutional. The court found that the statutes provided ascertainable standards of guilt in satisfaction of due process requirements and that possession of obscene materials was not constitutionally protected as free speech. Thus, the court upheld the constitutionality of the statutes. Defendant next contended that his possession and sale of the obscene material fell within an exception for obscene materials held by authorized persons for prosecution purposes. He claimed that he possessed and sold the obscene materials at the request of F.B.I. agents. However, the record, which included the agents' testimony, did not support defendant's contention.

The lower court found that one conveyance from grantor mother to petitioner son was an ineffective attempt to alienate a homestead without consideration, and that grantor mother had only conveyed a life estate. The district court affirmed. On appeal, the court quashed the district court's decision. The court interpreted ch. 95.23 and found that when there was an attempted alienation, which was illegal or ineffective against the heirs of a homestead owner, the heirs could immediately enter a court of equity to establish their interest in the subject matter.

The chancellor entered summary final decree for plaintiffs enjoining defendant from enforcing the provisions of Ordinance 58-35 against plaintiffs, and dismissing the counterclaim of defendant.

It was invalid and unenforceable both as to taxicab companies holding master permits issued by the commission, and as to taxicab companies regulated by ordinances of the various municipalities located within Dade County.

The motion was denied and, upon trial, the municipal court found them guilty. Appellants then took a direct appeal to the supreme court. Appellee moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The court ruled that appellee's argument was well taken and that the court lacked jurisdiction under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 4, which provided for direct appellate jurisdiction only in cases involving construction of a state statute. Although appellants' motion referred to the state statute, they were charged and convicted of violating a city ordinance. Thus, the supreme court lacked jurisdiction over a direct appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was the real estate commission. Appellee was a real estate broker. Appellant revoked appellee's registration by order due to his confinement in a federal institution for income tax evasion.

Appellee filed a complaint in circuit court asserting that Fla. Stat. ch. 475.25(2)(1957) was unconstitutional, and seeking to enjoin appellant to interfere with the broker's retention of his registration certificate. The circuit court ruled in favor of appellee and, by final decree, declared ch. 475.25(2) unconstitutional. Appellant challenged the decree. The court concluded that the circuit court's decree in the original certiorari proceeding, upholding the revocation of the license, became final as between the parties on the expiration of the appeal period. The cause of action and the parties in subsequent proceedings, the proceedings involved directly in this appeal, were identical and, as between these parties, the matter was res judicata.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee insured had brought a claim against appellant insurer for proceeds under an insurance policy. The policy provided that any suit under the contract must be filed within twelve months from the discovery of the loss. The court addressed the question of whether the policy, which originated in a foreign state, was valid under Fla. Stat. ch. &sect; 95.03. Section 95.03 provided that any policy terms requiring suit to be filed in a period shorter than five years were void. Construing the statute so as to avoid the conclusion that it was unconstitutional, the court held that the statute could not be held applicable solely to contracts made and executed in Florida. By construing the statute in its entirety, the court ruled that it was clear that it was intended to apply to any contract whatever, foreign or domestic. Thus, there was sufficient contact with the state for the court to exercise jurisdiction. As to the loss sustained under the policy, the court held that under the rule that an insurance policy must be construed in favor of the insured, the loss sustained was covered. The loss sustained was not due to a willful act on the part of the insured.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the terms of appellant insurer's policy requiring suit to be brought within twelve months from the discovery of the loss were void because the legislature clearly intended to prohibit such limitations under its statutory provisions.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus and asserted he was illegally detained under his imposed sentence and could only be sentenced for a maximum of five years.

After a chancellor issued an injunction and decreed that the section was not self-executing but required the legislature to create the offices of circuit court judges, appellants, the secretary of state and the comptroller, sought review. On appeal, the court held that it was clear that the provision should have been construed to be self-executing and as not requiring legislative action to activate the effect of its provisions as to the number of judges. The court vacated the decree, the injunction, and dismissed the suit because the provision was self-executing. The incumbent governor had both the authority and duty to fill such vacancies by appointment, and appellee had the authority and duty to fill any remaining vacancies by appointment after appellee came into office. The court also held that appellee would have no authority to appoint any person to the offices appointed by the incumbent governor, unless any such office fell vacant through one of the causes provided by law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bookseller was convicted of the sale and distribution of an obscene magazine in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 847.01 (1957). He sought review and argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 847.01 was unconstitutional because it eliminated the requirement of scienter and because it failed to set forth ascertainable standards of guilt. He further argued that the trial court committed error when it instructed the jury. The court reversed and remanded. It construed the statute to impliedly require a charge and proof of scienter. It found that a person charged under the statute had to be charged with commission of the prohibited acts and with knowledge of the obscene character of the documents or articles involved. Furthermore, the state was required to prove the knowledge at trial. The court also found the jury charge was in error because it had the effect of telling the jury that the appellant could be found guilty even if he lacked knowledge of the obscene character of the publication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under Fla. Stat. ch. 876.05- 876.06, public employees were required to execute a loyalty oath, which stated that they did not presently or in the past support the Communist Party or other subversive organization. Appellant teacher had been employed for nine years by appellee school district when it was discovered that he had not executed the loyalty oath. Appellant refused to execute it and filed a complaint for a declaratory decree that the statute was unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statute. On appeal, appellant asserted that the statute did not contain an element of scienter. The court thought that scienter was implied. Appellant next argued that the oath was unconstitutional because it was in addition to the oath prescribed by the Fla. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 2. The court responded that the oath in the Florida constitution applied to officers in the constitutional sense, not to employees like school teachers. Finally, the court concluded that appellant lacked standing to attack the statute as a bill of attainder or an ex post facto law because he denied any past or present associations which prevented him from executing the oath.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that upheld the constitutionality of the loyalty oath statute because it rejected appellant teacher's arguments regarding scienter and conflict with the state constitutional oath. Additionally, the court held that appellant lacked standing to raise arguments that the statute was an unconstitutional bill of attainder or ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant school district sought review of the decision of the trial court, which declined to validate bonds for the district after they were approved in a special election. The trial court declined to validate the bonds on the basis that the proceedings leading up to and including the election were so infected with gross and substantial irregularities that the reregistration of voters and the election were invalid. On review, appellee state contended that the reregistration statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 97.081, was unconstitutional and invalid. Upon review of prior decisions regarding the constitutionality of the reregistration statute, the court held it to be constitutional in light of the legislature's acceptance of the court's prior decisions and the fact that it had not attempted to repeal the legislation after such decisions. The court also held that special elections must be conducted in substantial compliance with constitutional requirements. One publication of the notice was not substantial compliance because the statute required notice to be published once a week. Such a requirement was a condition precedent for an effective election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because it found that the reregistration statute was constitutional and that substantial compliance with its procedures and requirements was lacking, which thus vitiated the effectiveness of the special election.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed a decree that validated revenue-anticipation certificates proposed to be issued by appellee county development authority. Appellee was authorized, pursuant to 1959 Fla. Laws ch. 59-103, to acquire real property and construct projects necessary for the development of the county. Appellee intended to use the proceeds to purchase real estate and construct a building that would be leased to a private business. The court reversed and held that the proposed bonds violated Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 10, which prohibited the use of public funds to benefit a private enterprise. The court stated that a plan that used public funds for a project that had a primary public purpose, and only incidental benefits to a private enterprise, was constitutional. The court found that, here, when appellee had no set plan for the project, the bonds should not have been validated. The court also commented on the process, noting that although it was not required under Fla. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant stated charged appellee by information with a violation Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 104.31, alleging that appellee, a county employee, advised other county employees to pay or contribute part of their salary to the campaign fund of candidates in a primary campaign. Appellee pled not guilty and filed a motion to quash the information, contending to the extent that &sect; 104.31 purported to make it unlawful merely to advise another employee to make a political contribution, it constituted an unconstitutional infringement of freedom of speech and a violation of Fla. Const. Decl. Rights, &sect; 15. The trial judge held that, for &sect; 104.31 to be constitutional, the word &quot;advise&quot; had to be construed to comprehend coercive or commanding advice. Inasmuch as the information failed to allege these additional elements, the judge sustained appellee's motion. Because the very act of advising by one employee to another in connection with political contributions was detrimental to the public service, such act could be prohibited and the commission thereof could be penalized. The trial judge erred when he concluded that &sect; 140.31 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner argued respondent did not have jurisdiction over rates as U.S. Const. art. VI, clause 2, the supremacy clause, precluded state interference. Respondent argued the power to regulate intrastate commerce was one of those powers reserved to the states by the U.S. Const. amend. X. The court reversed and recognized the supremacy of the general government in those areas in which the federal organic law directed it to function. The agreement of the government to move the household goods of servicemen was part of the government contract with the men at the time of their enlistment. Provision for such transportation was authorized by the Career Compensation Act of 1949, 37 U.S.C.S. &sect; 253(c). For both interstate and intrastate transportation of property owned by service personnel, it was obligation of the federal government to see to transportation of the property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By Fla. Gen. Laws ch. 57-368 (1957) the legislature attempted to abolish the fee system of compensation for county sheriffs by a general act that established a comprehensive salary scale. Appellee county sheriff submitted a proposed budget to appellant board of county commissioners. Appellant refused to honor appellee's salary requisition. Appellant brought an action that requested a declaratory judgment as to the validity of the statute. Appellant contended that the statute violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 20 and Fla. Const. art.

The supreme court reversed the trial court's decision finding that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 20 and Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 21. The court found that the statute purported to fix the annual salary according to the population of the county.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tax assessor sought review of a decision of the trial court (Florida), which granted appellee corporation's motion for summary judgment in appellee's action challenging the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 193.221 regarding a tax assessed against appellee's sub-surface rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A tax was assessed by appellant tax assessor against appellee company's sub-surface rights pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 193.221 upon the written request of the owners of the surface of the land. Appellee attacked the law upon constitutional grounds, asserting that it constituted a delegation of legislative power. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The chancellor granted appellee's motion, finding the tax void and enjoining its collection by appellant tax collector. The court upheld the finding of the chancellor, determining that the law was not a lawful exercise of the power of taxation by the legislature. While the legislature could exercise its taxing power through statutory boards acting within definitely prescribed statutory limitations, the exercise of taxing powers thereby granted could not be made to depend upon the arbitrary discretion of a statutory board or individual. Here the statute enabled the owner of a record interest in the surface of the land the ability to decide when the authority granted by the law would be exercised as to that particular tract of land, an unauthorized delegation of the legislative power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to appellee corporation in a suit brought to determine the constitutionality of a statute under which taxes on sub-surface mineral and oil rights were assessed. The statute was unconstitutional because it granted a taxing power dependent upon the unbridled discretion of the owner of a record interest in the surface of the land that amounted to an unlawful exercise of the power of taxation.</SPAN></P>

The court considered whether or not the record made by appellant school board in the trial court evidenced lawful compliance with the procedural requirements of Fla. Stat. ch. 236. It found that the record clearly established that the procedure followed was in compliance with the statute. Further, it found nothing in the statute, or any other law that required the state board of education to approve these bonds. Nevertheless, the court held that it clearly appeared from the record that the initial resolution proposing the bonds was approved by the state superintendent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court considered whether Fla. Stat. ch. 465.18, which required owners or operators of a retail drug establishment to have a licensed pharmacist in constant and immediate supervision, could be lawfully extended to cover all operations of a drug store, including those unrelated to the preparation and sale of controlled drugs and medicines. Appellee, who had been charged by appellant state with violation of the statute by information had successfully moved to quash the information. The court was mindful that only part of the business of a retail drug establishment dealt with the preparation and sale of controlled drugs while the other operations required no pharmaceutical skill and knowledge. Thus, it held that in order for the state to lawfully include innocuous operations of a drug store, it had to show that they were so related to preparation and sale of controlled drugs and medical supplies as to make their inclusion necessary to efficient enforcement. The court determined that it was impossible to construe the statute in this way so as to hold it constitutional, and affirmed the order of the lower court declaring it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the statutory requirement that appellant swear or affirm in writing that appellant had not registered as a member of any other political party during the two years immediately preceding the date of said oath was not arbitrary or capricious, but, rather, was reasonably related to the public policy of maintaining party loyalty and perpetrating the party system, which was essential to democratic government.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant teacher sought a temporary injunction against appellee school board after appellee discovered that appellant had never subscribed to the non-communist oath required of all public officials and employees under Fla. Stat. ch. 876.05. Appellant contended that being required to state the oath violated his constitutional rights. Appellant sought review after the chancellor denied the temporary injunction. On appeal, the court held that the chancellor did not abuse his discretion because appellant failed to demonstrate that irreparable injury would follow the denial of the injunction. Appellant alleged that he merely feared that appellee would discharge him based on his refusal to take the oath. The court found that the nature of any such injury was not clear, distinct, or unequivocal; thus, appellant's complaint failed to adequately support a case for injunctive relief. Finding no abuse of discretion, the chancellor's order was affirmed. The court declined to consider the constitutionality of 876.05 until the chancellor made a final ruling on the issue.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded the judgment, finding that the statutes were not vague and indefinite because they prescribed conduct that had an ascertainable standard of guilt. The court found that ch. 828.21 provided that the meaning of a &quot;delinquent child&quot; was as defined under the laws of Florida, and that Fla.

The trial court held that it had no constitutional power to hear and determine the cause because jurisdiction was wanting unless a suit to enjoin the assessment was filed after the roll became final and prior to the expiration of sixty days from that date under Fla. Stat. ch. 192.21. The trial court then dismissed the case based on lack of jurisdiction. Appellant attacked Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In separate cases, appellants were charged with unlawfully driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or narcotic drugs and while their normal faculties were impaired, in violation of Dade County, Fla., Traffic Ordinances &sect;&sect; 19.01-1 and 19.01-2. Each of the appellants claimed that he was entitled to a jury trial under Fla. Const. Declaration of Rights, &sect;&sect; 3 and 11. The trial judge denied motions for a jury trial in each case, and each of the appellants was tried without a jury and found guilty. Appellants' petitions for review presented the same issues and were consolidated. The appellate court held that Fla. Const. Declaration of Rights, &sect;&sect; 3 and 11 did not guarantee appellants the right to a jury trial because a violation of a local traffic ordinance was an infraction, not a crime.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that appellee was not entitled to the presumption created by statute,&nbsp;Fla. Stat. ch. 185.34 (1957). In the alternative, appellant maintained that if appellee was entitled to the presumption, the statute was unconstitutional for the reason that it was an arbitrary and capricious classification without any reasonable basis. The trial court held that appellee was entitled to the presumption and that the statute was constitutional. The supreme court reversed the lower court's decision. The court held that so long as there was a rational connection between the fact proven and the ultimate fact presumed and so long as the adverse party was given reasonable opportunity to proffer evidence and have a jury decide the facts at issue, there was no violation of due process or equal protection guaranteed by the state or federal constitutions.

</DIV>

Appellant filed its petition for compulsory payment of the claim. Two years later, a motion to dismiss appellant's petition was filed. The trial court denied appellant's petition on the ground that its claim was barred by the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 733.211. The statute provided for a three-year period in which appellant was entitled to file its compulsory payment claim. The supreme court affirmed the trial court's decision, finding that the statute in question was constitutional. The object of Fla. Stat. ch. 733.211 was to expedite and facilitate the settlement of estates in the interest of the public welfare and for the benefit of those interested in decedents' estates.

Stat. ch. 465.011 et seq., which excepted current Florida pharmacists from the four-year degree requirement, but excluded from eligibility for examination those pharmacists with identical academic training with that of others previously registered and currently practicing, deprived him of equal protection and abridged his privileges and immunities. The court affirmed the lower court's decision upholding the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 465.011. The court believed that the rule of prospective uniformity, subjecting all who entered the profession after the passage of the law to the same conditions, was the prevailing and proper view. The justification for the separate classification, that there was a presumption of competence arising from acceptable performance for a given period of time within the governing jurisdiction, was sufficient to uphold the statute.</SPAN></P>

After a chancellor granted a summary decree to appellee and ruled that the statute was constitutional, appellant sought review.

The court affirmed the summary decree for appellee because the chancellor's conclusion that appellee had the authority to fix minimum prices and require payment, was amply supported. The court found that appellee clearly had the power to require appellant to take milk delivered under a previous course of dealing. The court found no showing that appellant was affected by interstate commerce but noted if they were mere loss of economic advantage or income would not affect the situation.</SPAN></P>

It was perfectly apparent from the chancellor's decree that he found that respondent commission had before it the various factors involved in price-fixing. He further found no evidence produced showed that the operations of the distributors had been unprofitable or that the prices in effect would not render a fair return on their business.

Appellant city challenged the judgment, arguing that the trial judge lacked jurisdiction to determine the constitutionality of the statute and that appellees were estopped from raising the question. Examining the briefs submitted by the parties, the court determined that it lacked jurisdiction under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 4 to hear the case. The court noted that if appellant had, by its briefs and points raised, asserted its right to a review of the aspect of the decree which passed on the validity of a statute, the court would undoubtedly have had jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners began to make changes to a building and began to erect a pyramid atop a building. Appellee airport obtained a temporary injunction to prevent plaintiff from building the pyramid. Appellants then filed suit to invalidate Fla.

The court affirmed because zoning regulations duly enacted pursuant to lawful authority were presumptively valid and the burden was upon appellants to prove that it was unreasonable and bore no substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Appellants failed to substantiate their contention that the enforcement of the height limitation amounted to an unlawful taking of the property in controversy because the structure was being erected for aesthetic purposes only. The court found that the airport zoning regulations conformed to the standards of aviation and compliance with those Federal regulations was required to obtain federal aid in airport construction, thus it did not deprive appellants of the beneficial use of their land.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and stated that there was a clear distinction between an appropriation of private property to a public use in the exercise of the power of eminent domain, and the regulation of the use of property - and its destruction, if necessary - in the exercise of the police power. The court then considered whether the lower court erred when it held that Fla. Stat. ch. 581.17(2) (1957) was invalid insofar as it authorized the destruction of a grove owner's healthy trees before compensation shall be paid or secured to the owner. The court held that there was not a compelling public interest sufficient to have justified making an exception to the basic and fundamental rule of due process, that required notice and a hearing before the deprivation of a substantial right.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee entered into a contract with appellant by which the parties agreed not to re-enter the newspaper field in the county, directly or indirectly, as owner, stockholder or partner for a period of five years and would not abet such competition. Appellee, in a declaratory action seeking to have the non-compete provision declared void, alleged that he was untrained in any other business and could not earn a livelihood. Appellee claimed that under Fla. Stat. ch. 542.12 (1957), the agreement was not binding on him inasmuch as he had not sold the good will of any business, and had not executed it as a stockholder selling his shares in a corporation. Appellant alleged that appellee was restrained only from re-entering the newspaper or printing business in the capacity of owner, stockholder or partner and from aiding someone else in the establishment of a competing business. The execution of the agreement assuring non-competition was so necessary to consummate the sale that appellee thought his signature should fetch him a sizeable amount of money, which it did. As such, appellee was not entitled to equitable relief allowing him to repudiate his obligation under the contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision that a non-compete clause in a contract between appellant and appellee was void, holding that appellee was not entitled to equitable relief in appellee's attempt to repudiate his obligation under the contract because appellee received his share of the purchase price from the contract and received a bonus for signing the non-compete clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought the reversal of separate decrees of the chancellor affirming the validity of certain acts of the legislature that regulated aspects of appellant municipality. Legislative authority over state municipalities is provided in Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 8. The supreme court held that a state municipality is endowed with the powers of local self-government, and the legislature has control over the operation and management of property owned by a municipality in a proprietary capacity. So long as the statutory enactment recognizes the continued public nature of the property and merely sets up an agency for its operation and control in the continued interest of the public there can be no objection to such legislative action. Granting the existence of the power to act, the wisdom of exercising it, and the necessity for its exercise are matters for legislative determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the statutes promulgated by the legislature that regulated certain aspects of the government of appellant municipality were not violative of any provisions of the Constitution and, therefore, the decrees entered by the chancellor upholding the acts were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant inmate sought review of a decision of the trial court (Florida), which convicted her of the second-degree murder of her husband, on the ground that the statute under which the all-male jury panel was selected, Fla. Stat. ch. 40.01(1), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, appellant inmate challenged the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 40.01(1), which provided that the name of no female person was to be taken for jury service unless she had registered her desire to be placed on the jury list with the clerk of the circuit court, and argued that it deprived her of her constitutional rights to an &quot;impartial jury&quot; and to equal protection of the laws. The court disagreed and held that women, as a class, were excludable from the jury service without any infringement of appellant's constitutional rights, noting that a rule on or regulation of women's service on juries was not objectionable merely because it might have incidentally operated to limit the proportion of women on juries. The court further found that the statute under consideration was valid because it had not made an arbitrary classification or discrimination, but had a rational basis for its limitations as a protection against any infringement on women's primary duty in preserving the family unit. The court affirmed, rejecting as without merit appellant's remaining challenges to various procedural rulings during the course of her criminal trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant inmate's criminal conviction, finding that the statute under which the all-male jury panel was selected in appellant's case was constitutional because there was a rational basis for requiring women who wished to serve on juries to register their desire to be placed on the jury list with the court clerk, given that jury service could impinge upon their traditional responsibility for the family unit's daily welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the appellate court determined that appellee materialman's underlying cause of action did not arise out of Fla. Stat. ch. 255.05, but out of the performance bond executed by appellant contractor, holding that whether the statute was constitutional or not under the facts of the case was immaterial and not dispositive of the litigation regarding the bond. The appellate court found that the bond was required not only by the statute but by the express terms of the contract between the county and appellant contractor, noting that the bond by its terms was for the benefit of appellee in furnishing labor and materials for the project. Accordingly, the appellate court held that the portion of the judgment appealed from which purported to pass upon the validity of the statute was obiter dictum and thereby held for naught. The appellate court affirmed the remainder of the judgment as without error, holding that, even with the elimination of the portion of the judgment which had led to the direct appeal, the appellate court still had the authority to determine the remaining issues involved in the appeal under the language in Fla.

The landowner's property in the project area was nor dilapidated or run down. He brought suit to enjoin appellees from proceeding with the project, claiming it violated his right to possess property and was an unauthorized taking of private property for private use under Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 5, 10 and Fla. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 29. The validity of the plan was upheld. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the inclusion of sound structures did not invalidate the whole project because the purpose of the Urban Renewal Law was to transform an entire slum area into a wholesome community. Therefore, the condition of the landowner's property was immaterial. The court also held that the plan of slum clearance and redevelopment constituted a public use, directly related and inimical to the public health, safety, and welfare. It simply did not matter that incidental benefits would inure to private individuals or corporations.</SPAN></P>

Appellee brought an action alleging that the practice was an unconstitutional invasion of his rights to use the public ways and an illegal search and seizure contrary to the federal and state constitutions. The Chancellor held for appellee. The court reversed and held that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 322 required operators of motor vehicles to obtain a driver's license and Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 322.15 required every licensee to have his operator's license in his immediate possession when operating a vehicle. These requirements were a reasonable regulation of an individual right in the interest of the public good and did not disregard constitutional guarantees.

The court granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The court found the statute was constitutional despite the fact that there was no compliance with Fla.

Defendant county appealed from the decision, arguing the statute was a local act and it should have been enacted with the procedural formalities required under the constitution.

The trial court dismissed appellant's complaint upon appellees' motion, and appellant challenged the decision. The supreme court found that the amendatory statute was unconstitutional. The supreme court found that the amendatory act repealed the sections of the old act that provided for the examination and licensing of new applicants to practice naturopathy. The new act provided a new classification scheme, placing neuropaths into three different classes, all dependent upon when they obtained their license. The supreme court held that there was no reasonable basis for the attempt made to grant special privileges to a limited group, itself a closed class, within the larger closed class.

The information alleged that the larceny occurred while appellee was a municipal officer. Appellee filed a motion to quash the information, which was granted by the trial court. The trial court gave no reasons or grounds for granting appellee's motion. Appellee's motion alleged that the information showed on its face that the applicable statute of limitations had run, that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 932.06 was unconstitutional in that it denied the defendant equal protection and due process of law, and that the allegations of the information were insufficient. Appellant urged that the court had jurisdiction because the trial court, in granting the motion to quash, must have decided that &sect; 932.06 was unconstitutional. Where it was not shown by the order from which appeal was taken that the trial court directly passed on the validity of a statute, the court could not assume that the trial court did so. As such, the court remanded the action for an order from the trial court setting forth the grounds upon which appellee's motion to quash was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the order quashing the information that charged appellee with larceny while in public office, holding that the trial court gave no reasons for granting the motion and that where several grounds existed on which the trial court might have acted, even though erroneously, the court under its limited appellate jurisdiction had no right to act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Committee served the witness with a subpoena duces tecum, requiring him to produce at a stated time and place all books, records, and lists of memberships pertaining to certain organizations. The witness petitioned to quash the subpoena as unconstitutional. The trial court denied the motion, and he sought further review. The intermediate appellate court transferred the appeal to the court, which affirmed. It explained that whether the provisions in the subpoena for the production of documents and to otherwise testify had exceeded the Committee's authority was premature. It noted that the court could not assume that the questions to be asked, or the books to be produced, would have violated any constitutional right of the witness. The legislature had authorized the Committee to investigate alleged unauthorized activities. The time to raise the issue of the Committee's action was when it occurred. The court would not speculate in advance as to what the Committee might do, or how it might violate the witness's rights, and there had been no showing or reason for suspicion.</SPAN></P>

The court found there was no reasonable relationship between the restriction affecting the signs described and the safety of the public. The practicality of the argument that any sign placed beyond 15 feet of a right-of-way would not distract the motorist was difficult to comprehend. Furthermore, the court could not accept the view that gasoline dealers should be singled out and regulated in order to prevent motorist distraction, yet dealers in other products attractive to the motorist need not be so hampered.

After the chancellor upheld the contract as valid and enforceable and held Fla. Stat. chs. 25519 and 30202 unconstitutional and inoperative, defendant appealed. On appeal, the court noted that Fl.

The court affirmed the decree in part because the contract's validity was not attacked on grounds except other than the statutes and therefore it was valid and enforceable. The court reversed in part because Fla. Stat. ch. 30202 was unconstitutional in its entirety, and the court found parts of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were a land purchaser and trustees. Appellant land purchaser had a real estate purchase agreement with appellee, a property seller, to purchase 186 acres. A land survey found 132 acres of the land were dry and 54 acres were wet. Appellee held title to the dry land. Appellant trustees held title to the wet land. Appellant land purchaser brought an action for specific performance which offered to fulfill the agreement if appellee obtained title for the wet land. The trial court chancellor refused intervention by appellant trustees. The chancellor rejected appellee's argument that Fla. Stat. ch. 253.12 (1951) was unconstitutional because it deprived appellee of rights in the 54 acres under the Butler Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 271.01 (1921). The chancellor, however, held that appellee had sufficient title to receive payment from appellant land purchaser for all 186 acres. Appellant challenged the chancellor's decision by asserting that ch. 253.12 was unconstitutional because it repealed ch. 271.01. The court refused to decide that issue because the contract did not give appellee marketable title for the wet land. The court reversed the trial court decree and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Supreme Court of Florida granted petitioner railroad companies' writ of certiorari on the question of whether or not sand, phosphatic sand, dolomite, clay, and crushed rock were products that fell within the definitional section of Fla.

The court answered in the negative and concluded that the transportation of the subject material was within the excluded jurisdiction of respondent. In deciding the matter, the court employed a rule of legislative construction which provided that courts were obligated to give meaning to all words chosen by the legislature. The court reasoned that, notwithstanding the statute's confusing phraseology, by any accepted definition, the materials were neither horticultural nor agricultural, and they certainly had no connection with the seafood, forest, or dairy industries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant filed suit against, inter alia, appellee city and admitted in his complaint that he failed to comply with the provisions of 1937 Fla. laws ch. 18896 (chapter 18896), which required that a party give the city manager written notice of intent to sue prior to filing suit against the city. The trial court entered judgment in favor of appellee city on the ground that appellant failed to give the required written notice. On review, appellant argued that chapter 18896 was unconstitutional because the prerequisites for introducing local or special legislation were not followed in connection with the statute. The court rejected appellant's argument and affirmed the trial court's judgment. Chapter 18896 dealt with a subject comprehended in the term &quot;government,&quot; and therefore it was validly enacted pursuant to Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 636.261 was facially unconstitutional because it prohibited the direct or indirect solicitation of business by public adjusters and as it applied to appellee adjuster.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee public adjuster provided a service to insureds who had suffered loss by cataloguing and assessing value to their losses. Appellee did not provide his clients with legal advice. He filed suit to have Fla. Stat. ch. 636.261 (Ch. 636) declared unconstitutional as a restriction of his right to contract. Appellant state sought review after the lower court declared Ch. 636 unconstitutional. The court found that all adjusters, including public adjusters, were permitted to advertise their services without restriction by law. The court noted that public adjusters did not offer legal advice in providing their services. The court found that appellant state did not articulate a need to restrict all adjusters' legitimate business to protect the public morals, health, safety or welfare. The statute unreasonably and arbitrarily restricted state adjusters' right to contract, and the lower court's decision was upheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision declaring a state statute prohibiting public adjusters from soliciting business unconstitutional was upheld. Appellant state gave no reasonable justification, based on public health, welfare or safety, to restrain public adjusters from soliciting business. The court viewed the statute as an unreasonable restraint on a legitimate business and all public adjusters' right to freely contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state sought review of an order from the Circuit Court for Sumter County, (Florida) that quashed one count of criminal defendant's information charging him with unlawful possession of moonshine under Fla. Stat. ch. 562.451 because the statute was vague and unenforceable and that it lacked jurisdiction to hear that count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was charged with, among other counts, possession of moonshine whiskey in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 562.451 (Ch. 562.451), which prohibited possession of unregulated alcoholic beverages. The lower court quashed that count, finding Ch. 562.451 vague and unenforceable, and plaintiff state appealed. The court found that the statute was a patchwork of many prior laws that had been consolidated and did not effectively put citizens on notice that all moonshine was to be considered contraband. For example, the controlling section of Ch. 562.451 did not define moonshine whiskey as a proscribed alcoholic beverage, but another section strictly penalized possession of moonshine whiskey in a blanket fashion. Another section provided that possession of moonshine whiskey was only of evidentiary significance, but did not define it as a strictly liability crime. Finally, another section provided penalties for its possession. Strictly construing the criminal statute, the court agreed that the sections could not be reconciled and that Ch. 562.451 was unenforceably vague. Accordingly, the lower court's quash was upheld.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision that Florida's criminal moonshine whiskey possession statute was unenforceable as unconstitutionally vague was upheld. The statute's sections were irreconcilable and did not clearly define possession of moonshine whiskey as a felony, nor did the statute provide citizens with adequate notice that all forms of moonshine whiskey were to be considered contraband. Criminal defendant's information under the statute was properly quashed.</SPAN></P>

Yet as to the sale of writing instruments, the supreme court held that appellant pen corporation was a dealer, and that it should register as a dealer and collect and remit the use tax for the sales of writing instruments.

Defendant objected, claiming that his rights to freely travel between the states would be violated, and the statute did not provide for bail. The trial court held that the state statute was unconstitutional, and plaintiff appealed the ruling. The court held that since defendant was not a fugitive from justice, he had a constitutional right to travel between the state freely, and without restrictions. The court determined that under the U.S. Const. amend.

Appellee denied appellant's motion to quash the amended information, and the lower court affirmed appellee's decision. On further appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's order. Appellant had acted in bad faith when he circumvented the homeowner's restriction on the sale of the property. The homeowner had a legal right to refuse to sell his property to Jews. By failing to inform the homeowner that the buyer was appellant's employee, appellant also breached his duty to inform the homeowner of any circumstance that might be reasonably expected to influence appellant's complete loyalty to the homeowner.

Appellants therefore argued that the search incident to their arrest was improper and that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence seized. Appellants also contended that the trial court erred in denying their motions for a severance and that the evidence was inadequate to sustain the jury verdict. The state supreme court affirmed the judgment because the lower court carefully instructed the jury with regard to the evidence that was allowed against each appellant, because the lower court acted well within its judicial discretion in denying the motions for severance, and because the trial jury could not have correctly arrived at any other verdict than the one reached based on the evidence.</SPAN></P>

Appellants contended that they had not violated ch. 473 and if their actions were found to be violative, then ch. 473 was unconstitutional. On review, the court found the statute was constitutional because it did not prohibit a non-certified accountant from working at the business or occupation of accountancy so long as he did not hold himself out as a certified public accountant. The court found that to prohibit non-certified accountants from doing routine accounting work would conflict with the fundamental right of citizens to enter into contracts of personal employment and would abridge the right of private property without any relation to the general or public welfare.

Appellant had been arrested for violations of Fla. Stat. ch. 855.01 (1955) and Fla.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner was arrested for violations of Fla. Stat. ch. 855.01 (1955) and Fla. Stat. ch. 855.02 (1955), so-called &quot;blue laws,&quot; when he opened his used car business on a Sunday and sold a car. He petitioned the trial court for a writ of habeas corpus against appellees, sheriff and constable, but was denied. On appeal, the court found the statutes unconstitutional and reversed the trial court's decision. The closing of all businesses on Sunday may have born a rational relationship to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare because protection was afforded to all citizens from the evils of uninterrupted labor. However, it did not follow that laws containing the exemption of many businesses, such as the statutes under consideration, could be said to bear such a relationship as to have declared them valid general laws simply because they operated equally upon all within a certain class or classes. It was necessary that a valid and substantial reason exist to make such laws operate only upon certain classes rather than generally upon all. Thus, the statutes were unconstitutional and appellees were ordered to discharge appellant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court that discharged appellant prisoner's writ of habeas corpus petition was reversed because the &quot;blue law&quot; statute that required businesses to close on Sundays was unconstitutional; the state lacked a valid and substantial reason to make such a law operate only upon certain classes rather than generally upon all. Appellees, sheriff and constable, were ordered to discharge appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tile contractor sought review of the decision of the trial court (Florida), which dismissed appellant's complaint, declared Winter Park, Fla., Ordinance No. 548 valid, and held that the city tile examining board as constituted was valid under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant tile contractor sought an occupational license pursuant to Winter Park, Fla., Ordinance No. 548. Although appellant was issued a license, he was notified by the city tile examining board that the issuance was in error because he failed to pass an exam. After receiving notice of a revocation hearing, appellant sued for a declaratory decree, claiming that the ordinance was invalid. The trial court ruled against appellant and held the ordinance was valid and the board was properly constituted under the provisions of the ordinance. Appellant sought review, claiming the ordinance was invalid because it sought to regulate the business of a tile contractor, which did not affect the public interest and bore no substantial relationship to any legitimate objective of police power. The court held it could not rule on appellee city's authority because the issue was not placed before the trial court. However, the court, based on the assumption that appellee city was authorized to regulate the business of a tile contract, held the ordinance contained an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The court reversed the order and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment upholding an ordinance of appellee city and held that the ordinance contained an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landowners entered into a written contract with a general contractor for the construction of a residence on their premises. The contract did not require a surety bond and authorized the owner to pay to the contractor 90 percent of the contract price prior to the time when final payment was due. After the owners had paid this amount, the contractor abandoned the contract. The lower court entered a summary decree in favor of respondent lienor for the full amount of his lien irrespective of the amounts that petitioners had paid to the general contractor. Petitioners contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 84.05(11)(a) (1955), which compelled petitioners to have secured a performance bond or in the alternative to withhold 20 percent of the payments as they become due under the contract, and that subjected them to both personal and property liability if they failed to do either, impaired their liberty of contract and subjected them to a penalty that was so unreasonable and unconscionable as to deprive them of their property without due process of law. The court held that petitioners' contention was sustained. Fla. Stat. ch. 84.05(11)(a) (1955) was held unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order that granted respondent lienor the full amount of his lien was quashed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings because the statute that subjected petitioner landowners to both personal and property liability in the event that they failed to have secured a performance bond or withheld a portion of the payments impaired their liberty of contract.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants wished to construct a multiple level parking garage on their property. Plans were exhibited to appellee city council in connection with the application for a building permit, which called for the construction of a multiple level parking garage and revealed a number of mercantile stores to be located on the street level for the purpose of financing the project. Appellee rejected appellants' application for a permit for construction because the property was zoned for multiple-family districts. The court affirmed appellee's decision, and held that the ordinance at issue was reasonable and constitutional. Nothing in the ordinance deprived appellants from beneficial use of their property. The use of a portion of the building for stores or other business enterprises would have violated the integrity of the district and started a growth that could have spread and destroyed the character of the neighborhood. It would have constituted spot zoning, a practice that the court and all other courts had universally condemned.</SPAN></P>

On an earlier appeal, the court found that relator could not be denied admission solely because of his race, but declined to issue a peremptory writ of mandamus. Relator appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which found he was entitled to immediate admission to respondent based on Brown. Relator filed a motion for a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel respondent to admit him. The court found that the Supreme Court's ruling did not abrogate the rule which denied federal courts the right to regulate or control long-established rules of practice and procedure adopted by state courts for the administration of justice. The court found that the state had a dominant interest to prevent violence at respondent university. The court found that violence in university communities and critical disruption would have occurred if Negro students were admitted to respondent.

The court held that the legislature had the power to enact the law and that they could validly condition the adoption of the act upon the approval of the voters most interested in the matter. This was not a referendum under the state constitution. The trial court had concluded that comprehensive zoning of rural property was a fundamental right and could not be regulated through special or local acts.

Appellee was indicted for perjury based on the allegation that he had sworn falsely that he had not lent assistance to the party. The criminal court granted appellee's motion to quash both indictments. One of the grounds for the motion was that state statutes on sedition were preempted by federal legislation. On appeal, the court decided that the loyalty oath requirement under Fla. Stat. ch. 876.05 did not interfere with the federal government's prosecution of those who engaged in sedition. Appellee also argued that the loyalty oath statute was unconstitutional because it asked about his former relationship with the Communist Party. The court recognized that assistance to the Communist Party could have been unknowing, and implied a knowledge requirement into the statute.

Appellant argued that because ch. 28150 was invalid, chs. 465.02,07 were not repealed, and therefore, he could take the exam thereunder. Appellees replied that ch. 28150 did not violate art. III, &sect; 16 and that, even if it did, this flaw was corrected by ch. 29615, Acts of Fla. 1955. The court agreed with appellees and found that because the two titles of ch. 28150 were sufficiently similar and reasonably related to the topic of pharmacy, this provision did not violate art. III, &sect; 16. Therefore, the court affirmed the circuit court's order to quash the writ.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court decision to quash a writ of mandamus requested by appellant, a potential pharmacist, to direct appellees, Florida Board of Pharmacy, to permit him to take the board exam to practice pharmacy. The court held that the state law appellant challenged did not violate the Florida Constitution's requirement of similar and related topics, and hence the constitution did not invalidate the state law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted in the municipal court for serving beer to a minor, and she appealed her conviction. The circuit court granted respondent town's motion to dismiss because petitioner failed to file an appeal bond as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 932.52(16). The court affirmed the decision of circuit court. In so ruling, the court rejected petitioner's argument that ch. 932.52(16) unconstitutionally restricted her right to appeal. The court found that ch. 932.52(16) did not deny the right to appeal but merely regulated the method by which criminal defendants exercised the right to appeal. Moreover, the court found that a bond requirement did not place an unreasonable or prohibitive burden on one seeking review by the circuit court. The court ruled that the requirement of a bond was a reasonable and valid exercise of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of Alachua County (Florida) that affirmed the order of the Municipal Court of Gainesville which revoked petitioner's driver's license after petitioner was convicted of driving a vehicle in an intoxicated condition. Petitioner contended that Fla. Stat. ch. 322.25(2) imposed unconstitutional punishment and constituted an improper delegation of authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner challenged the revocation of his driver's license by the municipal court after he was convicted of driving in an intoxicated condition. The court affirmed the revocation. It was uniformly accepted across the entire country that the state had the power to grant drivers' licenses and the corollary power to suspend or revoke the license under appropriate circumstances. Suspending or revoking a license was an aspect of protecting the public from the dangerous behavior of the licensee, not punishing the licensee, and consequently, the revocation of petitioner's license was not punishment, double punishment, or a bill of attainder. Fla. Stat. ch. 322.25(2) did not violate Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 34 which authorized the creation of municipal courts to punish violations of municipal ordinances. Again, revocation was not punishment. Further, actual revocation was mandatory under ch. 322.25(2), making it an administrative or ministerial duty that did not provide the municipal court, or any other court, any discretion. As revocation was ministerial duty, it comported with art. V, &sect; 34 and was not offensive to the Florida Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for a writ of certiorari was denied because the revocation of petitioner's driver's license was a mandatory, ministerial or administrative duty of the municipal court, and revocation was not offensive to the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the chancellor's determination that Village of Virginia Gardens, Fla. Ordinance 47 and Fla. Ordinance 49 were unconstitutional and affirmed the injunction against enforcing them. Appellant municipal corporation enacted the subject ordinances that regulated water rates and that resulted in a gross operating loss to appellee private water company. Appellee alleged that the ordinances violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV and sought an injunction. On review, the court found that appellant merely asserted that appellee had not exhausted its administrative remedies. However, there was no showing that such remedies existed, and the court held that it took more than the mere saying so by the party asserting it that there was such remedy. The court held that utility rates, when adopted, had to be adequate to produce a reasonable return on capital investments and to meet operating expenses.</SPAN></P>

Laws. ch. 30227 unconstitutional and quashed the proceedings and transferred the cause to the criminal court of record. Appellee was arraigned for manslaughter and pleaded not guilty. Appellee filed a motion to quash the proceedings, which was granted by the circuit court on the grounds that the statute under which appellee was charged was unconstitutional. On review, the court found that under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 16, the title of an act defined its scope, and the body of an act was not allowed to contain a valid provision beyond the range of the subject stated in the title. The court found that the body of ch. 30227 appeared to operate upon a class of persons broader than the title of the act indicated and held that the entire section was unconstitutional. The court held that that the legislature intended the act to be entire and not severable, and the errors of draftsmanship were sufficient to require a declaration that the act was repugnant to the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

Appellant citizen groups filed suit for declaratory and injunctive relief, challenging the lease agreement as unconstitutional. The trial court denied the injunction and sustained the validity of the lease. Appellants sought review, contending that the execution of the lease was prohibited by Fla. Const. art.

Testing the validity of the lease agreement against Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 10 and the city charter, the supreme court ruled that appellee city did not abuse its discretion. The supreme court ruled that beautification of a modern city by extensive and well-conceived planting of trees, flowers, and shrubs was a proper function of municipal government. Similarly, the supreme court noted that the lease was circumscribed by restrictions that precluded the exploitation of the land and the contemplated improvements for private gain.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a decision of the lower court (Florida) which held that a portion of appellant's ordinance was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant installed a sanitary sewer system and passed an ordinance requiring connection. The ordinance provided that upon such connection being completed, any septic tank being used was to be discontinued and filled with soil. Section two of the ordinance provided that any licensed septic tank contractor could do the work. The lower court, in a suit filed by the appellee for injunction, held that section two of the ordinance was in conflict with Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 469, which provided that in a city of 7,500 people, anyone seeking to do plumbing work had to first receive a certificate and permanently enjoined appellant from enforcing that section. Appellant argued that the ordinance was valid and that the legislative act was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the injunction. The action of the legislature in limiting the application of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 469 to cities of over 7,500 population was clearly within the legislative field. The fact that the act did not apply to all cities and towns of the state did not, within itself, render the statute unconstitutional. Because the legislative act was valid, section two of the ordinance was in conflict and invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court's decision which held that a section of appellant's ordinance was unconstitutional and which denied appellee's request for attorney's fees was affirmed because the ordinance clearly clashed with a valid and constitutional state law and appellee was not entitled to attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

Although the trial judge's reasons for ordering a jury trial might not have been sound, the error was harmless. Because the trial judge had the power to direct the course of the trial in a manner consistent with the requirements of justice, he could order a trial by jury so long as he did not abuse his discretion.
