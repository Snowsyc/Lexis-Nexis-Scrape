Appellant also argued that the trial court erred by refusing to allow him to cross-examine a witness about unserved warrants against her for felonious assault, and failed to intervene ex mero motu to preclude the prosecutor from making numerous improper statements to the jury during closing arguments. Concluding that appellant's trial and capital sentencing proceedings were free of prejudicial error, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence, holding that appellant was not prejudiced by the granting of relief that he had sought in opposing joinder of the additional murder charge.

Upon advise of counsel, defendant pleaded guilty to the sexual offense charges. Defendant was convicted of both counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence because defendant received a fair trial and capital sentencing proceeding. Defendant voluntarily and knowingly entered into the plea and the court was satisfied that defendant understood the strategy behind the plea. Counsel was competent and fully believed the plea was the best way to avoid the death penalty. Based on the evidence and defendant's numerous confessions, counsel realistically concluded defendant had little defense to the charged crimes and attempted to spare his life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a judgment of the Superior Court, Richmond County (North Carolina), which imposed a sentence of death upon defendant after defendant pled guilty to first-degree murder on the basis of premeditation and deliberation and to robbery with a dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant entered a grocery store, robbed the store and murdered one of the co-owners. Defendant was apprehended and arrested. Defendant pled guilty to first-degree murder on the basis of premeditation and deliberation and to robbery with a dangerous weapon. Defendant exercised his right of appeal and bypassed the Court of Appeals. Defendant maintained the instructions given to the jurors prior to voir dire were not proper, a juror was improperly dismissed, he was not permitted to give a peremptory instruction regarding mitigating factors, proper mitigating factors were not presented to the jury, and the sentence was disproportionate. The court affirmed the lower court's decision and upheld the application of the death sentence. The court reasoned that none of the issues that defendant raised on appeal created prejudicial error or resulted in an unfair sentencing proceeding. Further, the court held that the jury decided that the mitigating factors did not apply, but rather the aggravating factors of defendant's conviction of a prior violent felony and commission of murder for pecuniary gain convinced the jury. Lastly, the court held that the death sentence was not disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court, which imposed the death sentence on defendant, was affirmed because the jury properly applied the aggravating factors of defendant's commission of the murder for pecuniary gain and a prior violent felony conviction to determine that defendant should be sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged judgments imposing sentences of death after he was convicted of the first-degree murders of two men. Defendant broke into a home to steal a gun. Defendant shot one of the men after he awoke while defendant was stealing the gun. The other man accosted defendant and was also killed and castrated. Defendant then set fire to the home. On the morning after the murders, defendant's family tried to have him committed and he was arrested at a detoxification center. Among numerous other contentions, defendant argued the trial court violated his rights as an indigent defendant to have two attorneys represent him while his lead attorney was ill during a pretrial proceeding; erred in failing to dismiss, at the close of all the evidence, the charge of first-degree burglary since the indictment was insufficient to allege burglary; and erred in finding that defendant's incriminating statements were entirely voluntary. The appellate court affirmed the convictions and sentences, holding that effective representation did not require that both appointed attorneys be involved in every aspect of defendant's case, and there was no error or abuse of discretion by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finding there was no error or abuse of discretion by the trial court, the court affirmed the conviction and death sentence, concluding that the case was not substantially similar to any case in which the court had found the death penalty disproportionate because defendant was properly convicted of killing two men in their homes and showed no remorse for the brutal murders and castration.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-27(a), appellant challenged as of right a judgment of the Superior Court of Guilford County (North Carolina) that imposed a sentence of death on him upon a jury verdict finding him guilty of first-degree murder, robbery, burglary, and kidnapping. Appellant contended he was entitled to a new trial based on procedural and evidentiary errors by the court during his trial and capital sentencing proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his convictions for first-degree murder, contending the trial court erred by denying the motion of his two attorneys to withdraw, by failing to make necessary findings to support its initial decision to shackle him, and by abusing its discretion in refusing to unshackle him before he testified. Appellant also contended the trial court erred by denying his assignments of error pertaining to the jury selection process, claiming the prosecution was allowed to peremptorily excuse a black prospective juror on the basis of race. Appellant also asserted he was entitled to a new sentencing hearing because robbery was improperly submitted to the jury as an aggravating circumstance. The appellate court affirmed the judgment because appellant failed to satisfy the two-prong test to establish prejudicial error arising from denial of his attorneys' motions to withdraw, the reasons given by the trial court adequately explained its actions regarding appellant's restraint, the prosecution's reasons for its peremptory challenges were properly deemed race neutral, and aggravating circumstances were properly submitted to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Based on its conclusion that appellant received fair trial and capital sentencing proceedings, free of prejudicial error, the court determined the sentence of death recommended by the jury and entered by the trial court must be left undisturbed because a murder committed in the home particularly shocked the conscience since such murder involved violation of an especially private place, one where a person had a right to feel secure.</SPAN></P>

It found that the prior criminal activity was properly admitted, that it was proper to submit the mitigating circumstances to the jury, that the defendant's counsel's performance did not fall below an object standard of reasonableness, and that it was proper to admit photographic evidence of the victim's condition after the murder because the Rules of Evidence did not apply in a sentencing hearing.

Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 143-443(b), 143-469(b)(2), 143-456(a)(2), (4), and (5), and North Carolina Admin. Code tit. 2, r. 9L .1005(b), (c), and (e).</SPAN></P>

A neighbor exited her home and encountered a vapor that made her eyes burn and her lips tingle. The neighbor complained to the NCDA. The Pesticide Board concluded that the sprayer violated laws by applying the pesticide in a manner inconsistent with its label and by applying it in a faulty, careless, or negligent manner. The Pesticide Board concluded that the sprayer also aerially deposited pesticide within 300 feet of the nearby business, 25 feet of a highway, and 100 feet of the neighbor's residence. The sprayer sought judicial review in the trial court. The trial court reversed. The court of appeals affirmed and the court reversed. The court held that the court of appeals erred in holding that there was not substantial evidence to support the pesticide board's decision to assess a civil penalty. The court concluded that rule 9L .1005 did not violate the constitutional rights of due process or equal protection. The distinction between aerial and ground applicators was rationally related to the increased likelihood of an off-target occurrence associated with aerial application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals and reinstated the NCDA's decision against the sprayer.</SPAN></P>

Defendant moved to dismiss the charges against him under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-954(a)(4), alleging that the detention statute was unconstitutional. The district court dismissed the charges. The state appealed and the reviewing court affirmed. Defendant appealed, contending that &sect; 15A-534.1(b) was unconstitutional facially and as applied in his case. The court held that the statute was facially constitutional. However, the court determined that application of &sect; 15A-534.1(b) significantly harmed defendant's fundamental right to liberty when unreasonable delay prevented him from receiving a prompt post-determination hearing before the first available judge regarding the conditions of his pretrial release. The court held that defendant was not given an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner, and the application of &sect; 15A-534.1(b) violated his procedural due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The class was composed of taxpayers who paid the intangibles tax but failed to meet the notice requirements of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-267. Under the tax scheme of N.C Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-203, shareholders of corporations doing business inside the state were taxed at a lower rate than shareholders of corporations not doing business within the state. Subsequently, the Supreme Court held that the deduction provision was unconstitutional. The trial court decertified the class and dismissed the action for refunds for failure to comply with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-267. In response to the Supreme Court's decision, 1997 N.C. Sess. Laws 771,771 was enacted, which based the refund rights of the class on the notice requirements N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-267. The court reversed the decision of the trial court because all the taxpayers who benefited from the unconstitutional deduction provision were relieved of liability. Further, taxpayers complying with &sect;105-267 were provided a refund. Thus, 1997 N.C. Sess. Laws 771,771, violated the tax uniformity requirement of N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A taxpayer received a judgment in a patent infringement action and classified the judgment for North Carolina corporate income tax purposes as nonbusiness income under N.C.

The North Carolina Department of Revenue reclassified the award as business income which increased the taxpayer's tax liability. The secretary upheld the department's decision and the taxpayer paid the tax due and sought a refund. The trial court granted the secretary's motion for summary judgment and the appellate court reversed the trial court and granted summary judgment in favor of the taxpayer. The court reversed the appellate court and held that &sect; 105-130.4(a)(1) encompassed the independent functional test which allowed extraordinary transactions to constitute business income if the relevant asset was used by the corporation in its regular course of business. The judgment compensated the taxpayer for infringement of its patents which were an integral part of its regular business, and thus the court held the judgment constituted income and should have been classified as business income.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs claimed that the town of Bethania was created by the general assembly in 1839 and comprised 2,500 acres.

Defendants claimed that the town of Bethania was created by 1995 Sess. Laws 74 (1995 Act) and consisted of 400 acres. The court noted that the general assembly had the authority, by special or local act, to create municipalities and change the boundaries of municipalities. The court found that this caused plaintiffs' argument that the 1995 Act violated certain parts of the North Carolina Constitution to fail. The court found that the North Carolina Constitution did not direct the general assembly to create municipalities by general laws. Plaintiffs also contended that the 1995 Act violated N.C.

The court stated that the city was authorized by statute to use the impervious-area method in setting the fees and that there was substantial evidence that this was the best method for calculating the fees.

The trial and appellate court upheld the board's decision. On appeal, the state supreme court held that the statute's legislative goals and policies, combined with its adopting rules and regulations, were sufficient to withstand such a challenge. The court found that there was a need for expertise in the achievement of the legislative policy and that the board was more suited to making a decision such as this than was the legislature. Further, there were adequate procedural safeguards to assure adherence to legislative standards because a council and the court were required to approve the board's rules. The court ruled that the board's rule was properly adopted and that the board was not required to adopt the rules according to the Administrative Procedure Act.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and others convicted of murder in two fatal shootings were arrested after he assaulted a victim with the murder weapon. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of the unrelated assault. Specifically, defendant contended that the trial court erred by admitting (1) the victim's testimony regarding the assault, (2) the testimony of three law enforcement officers concerning the investigation of that incident, and (3) eight photographs of the victim's injuries and the crime scene. The crux of defendant's argument appeared to be that even if admissible under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 404(b), evidence of the prior assault should have been excluded under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 403 (1992). The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of misconduct otherwise admissible under Rule 404(b). In fact, the trial court guarded against the possibility of prejudice by providing the jury with a limiting instruction before the victim's testimony. The court further concluded that defendant received a fair trial and capital sentencing proceeding, free from prejudicial error.</SPAN></P>

Similarly, defendant's Fifth Amendment rights were not violated because there was a break in custody between his assertion and his confession. Excusal of a potential juror was proper where she admitted her inability to vote for the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the relationship between the public employee retirement systems and plaintiff state and local government employees whose retirement benefits vested was contractual in nature, that the right to benefits exempt from state taxation was a term of such contract, and that such exemption did not constitute an unconstitutional contracting away of the state's taxation power. The state's passage of 1989 N.C. Sess. Laws chapter 792, &sect; 3.9 (the Act), which placed a cap on the amount of benefits exempted from state taxation, impaired the contract and the impairment was not reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose. Thus, the Act was an impermissible impairment of contract under U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The Act also constituted an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation. The court held that the trial court's error in granting an injunction barring future collection of taxes was not prejudicial and that the state should cease collection of taxes pursuant and begin issuance of refunds. The court held that the trial court erred by limiting relief only to those taxpayers who protested in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-267 (1989).</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed in part, holding that the tax benefit bestowed on religious entities by &sect; 105-275(32)(v) was not merely incidental, but rather was an exclusive benefit denied to other similarly situated nonprofit homes for the aged. The court reasoned that to differentiate between the homes resulted in the favoring of the religious over the secular. Additionally, the court reversed in part because &sect; 105-275(32)(v) was an integral part of the definition of a qualifying home for the aged, sick, or infirm contained in N.C. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stole mail from an apartment building, including a credit card bill the card number of which he used to order clothing from a catalog. He decided that he could be connected to the mail theft and decided to destroy the evidence by setting fire to the apartment building. Defendant and a companion used kerosene they purchased to ignite a fire in the apartment building. One man died from smoke inhalation and two women were severely injured. At the guilt/innocence phase of his trial on charges of first degree murder and attempted first degree murder, he presented no evidence. He was convicted of all charges. At the sentencing phase he was received the death penalty. On appeal, the court concluded that there was no error by the trial court in (1) failing to permit defendant to voir dire the jurors on the issue of parole, (2) admitting his medical records from the jail, (3) the state's peremptory strike of one black prospective juror, (4) refusing to instruct the jury as to second degree murder, (5) failing to intervene ex mero motu to correct allegedly improper arguments by the state, or (6) submitting aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the penalty phase.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to defendant's conviction for three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, he argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jurors, in the sentencing phase, that they were required to consider only statutory mitigating circumstances that they deemed to have mitigating value. The court found that the jurors were not so misled and defendant was not entitled to a new sentencing hearing. The court found that reading the entire jury charge in context, the instructions in question could not have had the effect of confusing issues of statutory and nonstatutory mitigating circumstances for the jury. Furthermore the court held that a mere lapse in language by the trial court while reading instructions to the jury, which was not called to the trial court's attention at the time it was made, would not have constituted prejudicial error when it was apparent from the contextual reading that the jury could not have been mislead. Furthermore, the court found that the sentences of death imposed upon defendant were not disproportionate to the crimes committed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was sentenced to death following a jury verdict of guilty of first-degree murder of his wife. The court overruled all 29 assignments of error finding no error in the trial or sentencing proceeding and held that the death sentence was proportionate. There was no error in the trial court's refusal to charge on self-defense because all of the evidence that would exculpate defendant showed that a shooting by his wife was accidental. There was no error in the admission into evidence during the sentencing hearing of four misdemeanor warrants against defendant. The wife had sworn to the warrants and evidence contained on the warrants was probative of an aggravating circumstance that defendant killed a witness against him. There was no error in the denial of defendant's motion to suppress all his statements to law enforcement officers and items gathered in a search of his home. Police had probable cause to arrest defendant after a neighbor told that he had killed his wife. When defendant came to the door armed with a toy pistol, this was an exigent circumstance that justified the police officers entering the house without a search warrant to arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not try to help the victim, he did not confess, and the transcript reflected evidence of numerous motives for the murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and first-degree murder. Following a capital sentencing proceeding pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000, the jury recommended the death sentence for the murder conviction. The Superior Court of Rowan County (North Carolina) sentenced defendant to death for the first-degree murder conviction and to a term of 10 years for the conspiracy conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant raised numerous assignments of error concerning both the guilt/innocent phases and sentencing phases on both charges. On appeal, the court found that the superior court had not erred in conducting the trials and affirmed the judgments of conviction. The court also affirmed the imposition of the death penalty on the first-degree murder charge. However, the court found that the superior court erred by imposing a sentence in excess of the presumptive sentence for conspiracy to commit murder without making findings in aggravation as required by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1340.4(a). The court reasoned that since the presumptive sentence for the conspiracy charge was three years, the superior court was required to find and weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors before it imposed a sentence greater than that contained in the statute. Accordingly, that portion of the judgment was remanded for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court did not find that the admission of the police officer's statement that defendant refused to put in writing his oral statement did not deprive defendant of his rights against self-incrimination because when he made the statement he had been given his Miranda rights. The court found no plain error during the capital sentencing for allowing the testimony of a witness about defendant's prior assault on her husband and the effect the attack had on her life. It was not error to refuse to submit the statutory mitigator that the murder was committed while defendant was under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance under N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged their convictions from the Superior Court, Cumberland County (North Carolina), for robbery with a dangerous weapon and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon. In addition, one defendant received the death penalty both for first-degree murder on the basis of premeditation and deliberation and under the felony murder rule, and the other received life imprisonment for first-degree felony murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, convicted for robbery and murder, claimed error, but the court found that defendants opened the door to evidence about killing a cat at the murder scene; the evidence was probative on the issue of intent, state of mind, or for context; and it was relevant to explain or rebut evidence elicited in cross-examining the state's witnesses, when defendants implied that another man acted independently and that they were only joking about a plan. The court found that one of them communicated his premeditated plan, fled, and used an alibi, so the trial court did not err in refusing a voluntary intoxication instruction. The court found that the death penalty was not based on passion, prejudice, or arbitrariness, and the sentence was proportionate because the murder occurred in the victim's home, defendant fled while the victim was alive but did not seek medical help, and defendant used the victim's homosexuality to induce him into a vulnerable position. The court asserted that no confrontation rights were violated and that one defendant's intent was irrelevant because they acted in concert. The court held that no mistrial was warranted and that the sentences would be undisturbed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendants' claims of error regarding their convictions for robbery and murder, holding that they received a fair trial and sentencing, free from prejudicial error, and the sentences as entered, a death sentence and life imprisonment, would be left undisturbed. Intoxication did not negate one defendant's premeditation and deliberation. Defendants induced the victim to be vulnerable in his home where he expected to be secure.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, town and utility company, brought an action against defendants, county and board of commissioners. The county challenged the constitutionality of the Water Supply Watershed Protection Act. The court of appeals (North Carolina) reversed the trial court's granting of the county's motion for summary judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The construction of a water intake by the town on a river in the county was going to make the river watershed subject to certain regulations of the EMC. The county contended that the WSWPA constituted an unconstitutional delegation of the power to legislate. The court held that the WSWPA was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143-214.5(b) (1996) specifically directed the management of watersheds by controlling development density, performance-based alternatives, or a combination of both. The procedural safeguards were adequate. The rule-making power of the EMC was subject to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143-214.1(e) (1996). The General Assembly created the Watershed Protection Advisory Council consisting of representatives of state and local government as well as special interest groups which met with the EMC seven times before rules were adopted. The WSWPA required the EMC to submit reports quarterly to the Environmental Review Commission. In adopting rules, 40 informational meetings and eight public hearings were held across the state. The failure of an amendment to the WSWPA to pass constitutional muster did not condemn the entire Act.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had properly excused six prospective jurors for cause, and properly refused to allow defendant to question them. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting defendant's questioning of two other prospective jurors because he had sufficient opportunity to ask questions to intelligently exercise his peremptory challenges as to these jurors. Also, there was sufficient evidence supporting defendant's convictions of first-degree murder, felony murder, lying in wait, and first-degree kidnapping.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of pouring gasoline on his girlfriend and setting her on fire with a match. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of a nurse regarding out-of-court statements made by the victim before her death in which she identified defendant. The court held that the trial court did not err in holding that the victim's statements possessed circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. There was no indication that the victim had any reason not to tell the truth after learning that defendant was in jail and could no longer hurt her. However, the trial court erred in relying upon corroborating evidence in reaching the conclusion that the statements were trustworthy. The evidence fully supported the conclusion of law. Therefore, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Further, the record supported the sole aggravating circumstance found by the jury that the murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel. The court concluded that the case had the characteristics of first-degree murders for which it had previously upheld the death penalty as proportionate. Accordingly, the death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

The trial court then entered an order setting forth findings and conclusions in support of the decision to deny defendant's motion for self-representation and to appoint the formerly designated standby counsel to represent defendant as his trial counsel.

App. 674, 471 S.E.2d 673 (1996), affirming in part and reversing in part a custody order entered by Chaney, J., on 29 March 1995 in District Court, Durham County.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff caretaker filed suit against defendant natural mother for legal custody of a child who lived with the caretaker. The District Court, Durham County (North Carolina), concluded that it was in the child's best interest that custody be awarded to the caretaker, but awarded custody to the mother because she was a natural parent; the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. The caretaker sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chief issue was what circumstances could require the constitutionally-protected interest of natural parenthood to yield to the &quot;best interest of the child&quot; test prescribed by N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-13.2(a). The court held that conduct inconsistent with the parents' protected status, which need not rise to the statutory level warranting termination of parental rights, could result in application of the &quot;best interest of the child&quot; test without offending the Due Process Clause. Where the responsibility of a parent to act in the best interest of his or her child required temporary relinquishment of custody, the parent should notify the custodian upon relinquishment of custody that the relinquishment was temporary. Because the trial court had made no findings about whether the caretaker and the mother agreed that the surrender of custody would be temporary or about the degree of contact that the mother maintained with the child after the parties separated, the court could not conclude whether the mother should prevail based upon the constitutionally protected status of a natural parent or whether the &quot;best interest of the child&quot; test should be applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the lower appellate court and remanded the cause for a determination of whether the mother's conduct was inconsistent with the constitutionally protected status of a natural parent. If so, the trial court should determine custody based on the &quot;best interest of the child&quot; standard.</SPAN></P>

The court further found that this did not bargain away a necessary state power, that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 128-27(i) and 135-5(n) allowed the employees three years from any continuing reduced payment in which to bring suit, that the employees were entitled to the reductions taken from them as well as to interest on those funds, and that the employees were entitled to their attorneys' fees out of the litigation fund created.</SPAN></P>

The jury found as four separate aggravating circumstances that defendant previously had been convicted of a violent felony and as an aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in the commission of a robbery. The jury found the statutory mitigating circumstances that the murder was committed while defendant was mentally or emotionally disturbed and that defendant's capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was impaired. The jury also found five nonstatutory mitigating circumstances and the catchall mitigating circumstance. The jury recommended a sentence of death.

The defendant appealed the conviction and sentence on numerous grounds. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant and sentencing him to death. The court held that the defendant received a fair trial and that the capital sentencing proceeding was free of prejudicial error. Specifically, the court found that the trial court committed no error by ordering the defense expert to prepare a written report of his findings for the state. The court concluded that the trial court was authorized to do so under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-905(b). Moreover, the court indicated that no physician-patient privilege was created between a physician and a criminal defendant who was examined in order to determine whether the defendant was able to stand trial. The court also found that there was no abuse of discretion in admitting photographs of the crime scene into evidence. Finally, the court concluded that a witness' hearsay statement was admissible under the state of mind exception to the hearsay rule.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that it was not error for the trial court to use the word &quot;may&quot; instead of &quot;must&quot; in giving the instruction concerning the non-statutory mitigating factors. The court ruled that the trial court was without authority to require the jury to consider certain non-statutory mitigating factors that defendant asserted were supported by the evidence. The court ruled that it was not error for the trial court to refuse to instruct the jury that the defendant could be sentenced to life without parole because at the time the statute provided for the possibility of parole after 20 years. The court found that the jury's finding of aggravating circumstances was proper. The court found that the death sentence was proportional compared to sentences imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed this decision entered by the appeals court because N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-215 (1992) clearly showed that the North Carolina General Assembly intended that if any part of the statute providing for an intangible tax was declared unconstitutional, that part should be severed for the statute, and the balance of the statute should be enforced. The court found that the offending portions were not so interconnected with the other parts that enforcement could not be completed. The court reversed the portion of the appeals court's decision that did not apply the rule of the case retroactively. Specifically, the court found that the United States Supreme Court required that its application of a rule of federal law be given retroactive effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court's decision was affirmed because the court found that the unconstitutional portions of the intangibles tax statute and the other parts were not so interrelated or mutually dependent that the imposition of the tax could not be done without reference to the offending part.

The district attorney argued that the General Assembly was without constitutional authority to pass &sect; 7A-66.

Both parties appealed. In reversing in part and affirming in part, the court held that (1) where the city adopted a resolution to prosecute the dinette owners and an injunction forbidding the dinette's operation, there was an issue of fact whether the dinette owners' freedom of speech was thereby abridged and thus suit under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 was appropriate, (2) the city officials could be sued in their official capacities, (3) whether the city officials in their individual capacities retaliated against dinette owners because of their free speech exercise was a question of fact, (4) the city officials were not entitled to qualified immunity, and (5) there was an issue of genuine fact as to whether the city officials acted out of malice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and criminally convicted following the murder of her disabled husband. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court used the same item of evidence to prove more than one aggravating factor in both the conspiracy and solicitation cases. The court disagreed because the language on the sentencing form was explanatory, not a separate factor. Thus, the trial court did not find two factors in aggravation based on the same evidence. The court agreed that solicitation to commit murder was a lesser offense of murder as an accessory before the fact. Under the definitional approach, the court vacated defendant's conviction for solicitation to commit murder. The indictment and the evidence supported the verdict of murder. Witnesses' statements regarding the victim's then existing state of mind were admissible. Further, given the overwhelming evidence against defendant, there was no reasonable possibility that, had the evidence not been admitted, a different result would have been reached. Defendant was not induced to remain silent before her arrest, and the use of her prearrest silence for impeachment did not violate her Fifth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant was not entitled to a petit jury composed in whole or in part of persons of a certain race.

Therefore, the court upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty as applied to defendant. The court held that defendant failed to show that admission of the victim's pictures was unduly prejudicial or improper. The court held that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find premeditation and deliberation in defendant's actions.

Defendant could be found guilty of sexual assault even if the assaults occurred after the victims died because the assaults were a part of a continuous transaction that began when the victims were alive. There was sufficient evidence that defendant committed two of the murders based upon his desire to avoid arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant was convicted of first degree murder and several other crimes and sentenced to death. The court affirmed the lower court's sentence, finding that there had not been abuse of discretion or prejudice when the lower court refused to permit inquiry as to jurors' feelings regarding the death penalty. Similarly, the court found that the jury instructions issued concerning the meaning of a life sentence had been proper because a defendant's eligibility for parole was not a matter for jury consideration. The court found that opinion testimony from lay witnesses was properly admitted as having been rationally based on witness perceptions and helpful to understanding the issues. The court held defendant failed to demonstrate that disputed prosecutorial arguments caused gross impropriety. The court noted evidence of a codefendant's sentence was properly deemed not relevant to the jury's sentencing determination and that evidence of defendant's past violent felonies was properly admitted at sentencing. Finally, the court found that defendant's sentence was proportional to the crime of witness killing and upheld the forfeiture of his truck under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 90-112.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his nephews picked up a prostitute. When she asked for money, defendant assaulted her, had her put on handcuffs, took her to the woods, sexually assaulted her, had his nephews tie her to a tree, and stabbed her. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder, sexual offense, and rape and was sentenced to death. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentence. The court held that the deceased could withdraw consent anytime prior to penetration and that defendant's actions were constructive force for the purpose of the sexual assaults. His nephews' presence was enough to establish that defendant was aided and abetted because defendant was likely to regard their presence as encouragement. Testimony of defendant's prior bad acts was admissible because it demonstrated his modus operandi. The trial court was not required to give defendant's requested instruction verbatim as long as it gave it in substance. Defendant failed to produce the substantial evidence required to get mitigating circumstances submitted. The court held that defendant's death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate because it was premeditated, deliberate, and involved torture.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During voir dire, the trial court held that only one of defendant's two appointed attorneys was permitted to question prospective jurors.

The only aggravating circumstance submitted to the jury was that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(9). The jury found this aggravating circumstance to exist. Jurors also found one or more mitigating circumstances to exist. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 84-14 (1985) was not violated because the trial court did not deny defendant the assistance of a second attorney or so drastically circumscribe the second attorney's role as to render the appointment of two attorneys meaningless. The court further concluded that the record fully supported the aggravating circumstance found by the jury and found that there was no indication that the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary consideration. The court also held that the case was similar to six other cases in which the court found the death sentence proportionate.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the trial court's order of disclosure was a proper exercise of its discretion. The court found that it was not error for the state to introduce extensive evidence to prove the existence of aggravating circumstances that defendant had previously been convicted of a felony involving violence or the threat of violence to another person, because the prosecution had to be permitted to present any competent, relevant evidence relating to the defendant's character or record which would support the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Defendant sought review of the convictions and the death sentence, arguing that the trial court improperly admitted a knife found some time after the murders, that the prosecutor made improper comments during closing, that inadmissible character evidence was admitted, that the trial erred by failing to submit jury instructions, pursuant to N.C.

Defendant also argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could determine if defendant's age had chronological value as a mitigating circumstance. The court affirmed, stating that the trial court was required to submit, pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(f)(6) (1995), any statutory mitigating circumstance supported by the evidence. However, the consumption of alcohol by defendant was not enough to warrant submission of a statutory mitigating circumstance under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(f)(6).

Defendant testified that he intended to steal marijuana when he broke into and entered the victim's home; thus, there was direct evidence presented at trial of defendant's intent to commit larceny sufficient to support the burglary conviction. The court concluded that the pecuniary gain aggravating circumstance was properly submitted to the jury because pecuniary gain was not an essential element of the crime of felony murder.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizen filed suit challenging N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 158-7.1. The Superior Court of Forsyth County (North Carolina) found that the statute was unconstitutional, enjoined the local governing bodies from making further incentive grants, denied the citizen's motion for a mandatory injunction to require recovery of incentive grants, and dismissed the claim that the local governing bodies violated the Open Meetings Law. All parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen claimed that &sect; 158-7.1, under which the local governing bodies were authorized to make economic development incentive grants to private corporations, was unconstitutional because it violated the public purpose clause in N.C. Const. art. V, &sect; 2(1), and because it was impermissibly vague, ambiguous, and without reasonably objective standards. The court held that &sect; 158-7.1 furthered a public purpose because (1) it was within the appropriate scope of governmental involvement and reasonably related to communal needs and (2) it primarily benefitted the public and not a private party by creating a more stable local economy. The court also held that the meaning and intent of &sect; 158-7.1 were sufficiently clear to pass constitutional muster. The court further found that there was no violation of the North Carolina Open Meetings Law because there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's finding that each closed session held to discuss economic development expenditures was preceded by a motion and approving vote to go into closed session at an open and regularly scheduled public meeting and because no action was taken at the closed meetings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's rulings that N.C. Gen.

The court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the local governing bodies did not violate the Open Meetings Law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court concluded that it did not have the authority to accept the plea because there was sufficient evidence to try the case capitally. Upon review, the court reversed. It found that the Constitution did not prohibit the use of absolute prosecutorial discretion in determining which cases to prosecute for first-degree murder so long as such discretionary decisions were not based on race, religion, or some other impermissible classification. The prosecutor could accept a plea of guilty for second-degree murder or a lesser offense until defendant was determined to be guilty of first-degree murder by either plea or verdict. Not until then was the trial court bound to conduct a capital sentencing proceeding unless there was no evidence to support a finding of aggravating circumstances. The trial court acted under a misapprehension of law in refusing to consider the plea agreement.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's motion to bypass the Court of Appeals on additional convictions for first-degree arson, first-degree burglary, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and two counts of larceny of an automobile was allowed 9 July 1993. The appeal was heard in the Supreme Court 7 December 1993. On 2 March 1994, defendant filed a motion for appropriate relief with the Supreme Court, which remanded the case on 11 May 1994 to the Superior Court, Polk County, for an evidentiary hearing. The Superior Court denied the motion for appropriate relief in an order entered by Llewellyn, J., on 12 June 1995.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer filed suit against defendant, the Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Revenue, seeking to recover a refund for taxes paid under protest pursuant to the Soft Drink Tax Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 105-113.41 - .43 (Supp. 1994), N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 105-113.44 - .47 (1992). The COURT OF APPEALS OF NORTH CAROLINA had affirmed a judgment entered in favor the taxpayer. The Department appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department had conducted a Soft Drink Tax Audit of the taxpayer, a food service distribution company. Following the audit, the Department issued a Soft Drink Excise Tax Audit Report and a Notice of Tax Assessment to the taxpayer pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-241.1. By this notice, additional soft drink excise taxes were assessed against the taxpayer for sales of specific concentrated juice products covering a three-year period. The taxpayer unsuccessfully filed an objection to the assessment and an application for a hearing with the Department. By this objection, the taxpayer sought rescission of the assessment with respect to the concentrated products sold by it on the ground that such concentrated products were exempt from taxation pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-113.47. The taxpayer then filed a claim for refund pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-267 with the trial court, which granted summary judgment in favor of the taxpayer. The court held that a registration requirement was implicit in the Act and a relevant rule from N.C. Admin. Code tit. 17, r. 4D.0507 (July 1984). Thus, because the taxpayer failed to register with the Secretary, it was not entitled to a refund.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress his statements, that because he was intoxicated he could not formulate the specific intent to kill, and that his rights were violated when the trial court refused to admit allegedly relevant mitigating evidence during the sentencing proceeding. The court affirmed. Defendant's remarks were volunteered statements, and the detective's questions did not convert the conversation into an interrogation. The trial court found as fact that defendant was coherent and not confused, and that although defendant had been drinking, he was not under the influence of alcohol. The trial court then concluded as a matter of law that defendant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his rights. Defendant failed to carry his burden to produce substantial evidence which would support a conclusion by the judge that he was so intoxicated that he could not form a deliberate and premeditated intent to kill. The proposed testimony was not relevant and admissible under the auspices of allowing jurors to reconsider any guilt phase residual doubts.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found no error, holding that the jury selection and the guilt and sentencing phases of defendant's trial were free from prejudicial error and that the death sentence was not disproportionate. In analyzing the jury selection phase, the court found that the exclusion of jurors with a bias against the death penalty that might have impeded their ability to follow the law was proper and that defendant's failure to raise a Batson objection precluded him from raising the issue on appeal. During the guilt phase, the trial court properly ruled on the admissibility of defendant's prior assault on the victim, state of mind statements by witnesses, and defendant's conduct before and after the murder, and the prosecutor did not act improperly during his closing argument. Because of the nature of the crime and the aggravating circumstances, the death sentence was not disproportionate as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that the trial court's failure to give a peremptory instruction, which may have caused one or more jurors to fail to find as a mitigating circumstance that defendant worked as a cook in the prison, was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded that the record fully supported the aggravating circumstances found by the jury. There was no indication that the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary consideration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grandparents challenged the decision of the District Court, Buncombe County (North Carolina), which dismissed the grandparents complaint against defendant parents seeking visitation of their grandchildren based on the conclusion that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-13.1(a) (1994) was unconstitutional in that it deprived the parents of their right to determine with whom their children would associate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature's creation of special statutes to provide for grandparents' visitation rights suggested that it did not intend &sect; 50-13.1(a) as a broad grant to grandparents of the right to visitation when the natural parents had legal custody of their children and were living with them as an intact family. The legislature intended to grant grandparents a right to visitation only in the situations specified in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-13.2(b1) (1987), N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-13.5(j) (1994), and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 50-13.2A (1987). Had it intended otherwise, it would have repealed the specific statutes when it amended &sect; 50-13.1(a), the general statute. The court found that although the 1989 amendment probably was added to provide that in certain contexts &quot;custody&quot; and &quot;visitation&quot; were synonymous, in the context of grandparents' rights to visitation, the two words were not synonymous. The court held that &sect; 50-13.1(a) did not grant grandparents the right to seek visitation when no custody proceeding was ongoing and the minor children's family was intact.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In challenging his death sentence, defendant claimed the trial court erred in unduly restricting questions during voir dire about whether a prospective juror could consider imposing both a death sentence and life imprisonment on a convicted murderer and whether he would consider both aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Error was alleged in the excusals for cause granted to the state for five prospective jurors, in the trial court's refusal to give a peremptory instruction on several mitigating circumstances, and in its refusal to allow an expert witness for defendant to testify about his emotional or mental disturbances. The court found that the voir dire sufficiently covered attitudes regarding the death penalty, and thus, even assuming proper questions were excluded, their exclusion was harmless. The court also found a sufficient basis to show impermissible bias with respect to the jurors excused for cause, that the peremptory instructions were not required because the evidence on the mitigating circumstances was conflicting, and that any error in the restriction of testimony of the expert witness was harmless because other witnesses sufficiently covered the subject matter.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to death on each of these murder charges, and he appealed. The court affirmed. Defendant alleged several errors on appeal. Defendant first contended that the prosecutor selected his case for capital trial in an arbitrary manner in violation of defendant's constitutional rights. Capital punishment was not rendered unconstitutional simply because the prosecutor was granted broad discretion in deciding which cases to try capitally. Therefore, in order to prevail on his claim, defendant had to show that the decision to try him capitally was motivated by a discriminatory purpose and had a discriminatory effect. Defendant did not make this showing. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence taken from his residence during a search consented to by his girlfriend. A search was not unreasonable if lawful consent to search was given. A third party could give permission to search where she possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that where no offer of proof was made after objections were sustained, they were not preserved for appellate review. Moreover, no error occurred when the jury was instructed to consider defendant's sanity only after it had considered defendant's mental ability to formulate the specific intent to kill as these are two different concepts, and no improper shifting of the burden of proof occurred at trial. Finally, the sentencing proceeding was not improper because evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the State supported submission of the especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel circumstance instruction based on the particular aggravating circumstance or circumstances found by the jury during the sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>

It held that the jury properly found the existence of 5 aggravating circumstances, but found only 17 of 34 mitigating circumstances. The evidence was sufficient to warrant the submission of aggravating circumstance to the jury. Nothing in the record suggested that the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The death sentence was proportionate to the heinousness of the crimes.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that defendant had received a fair trial and that the death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate. Defendant had committed a brutal, merciless, and dehumanizing attack, which included severe blunt-trauma injuries and a depraved sexual offense. The record contained overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt, including his confession, DNA results, and blood-type matching. The evidence supported the aggravating circumstances under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(e)(9), (e)(5), (f)(1), and (f)(7). The victim had numerous injuries to her head, face, neck, chest, back, hands, and arms, as well as her rectum and vagina. Defendant's prior criminal history included his numerous beatings of the victim, an incident in which he shot a man, and a conviction for assault. Defendant contended that the trial court erred by finding that he voluntarily reinitiated interrogation after requesting a lawyer by saying, &quot;let's go ahead and talk.&quot; The court disagreed and found that he was not in custody at the time because he knew he was free to leave, and he was never handcuffed, frisked, or threatened.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that there was competent evidence to support the trial court's findings of fact that the search warrant was on the premises when the police entered defendant's residence and that it was read before any search was undertaken in the house. The court also held that the trial court held a voir dire to determine the admissibility of defendant's statement, and its findings of fact after such a hearing were conclusive and binding on the court because they were supported by competent evidence even though the evidence was conflicting.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, defendant one was guilty of felony murder by his own statement, and therefore, his conviction was affirmed. The court also affirmed defendant two's conviction and rejected his numerous assignments of error. Defendant two's confession was not obtained in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-501(2) simply because he was interrogated by police before he was taken before a magistrate. The police fully advised defendant two of his constitutional rights. Moreover, the fact that defendant two's confession was admitted in a redacted form did not violate his rights because he was not prejudiced by it.</SPAN></P>

The court held that there was a presumption that public officials discharged their duties in good faith and exercised their powers according to the law.

The court found that the taxpayers met their burden. N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 32 precluded exclusive or separate emoluments except in consideration of public services. All compensation due the county manager under the terms of his employment had been paid.

The court held that defendant's alleged &quot;Hobson's choice&quot; between asserting her privilege against self-incrimination and her right to testify on her own behalf was illusory. The trial court's denial of her motion for a continuance did not force defendant to choose between these two constitutional rights but to make a purely tactical decision as to whether it would be more advantageous to testify in that trial, in her capital trial, in both trials, or not at all. Defendant also argued that the trial court committed reversible error by admitting irrelevant evidence concerning the life insurance policy on her stepson, in violation of her right to a fair trial. The court held that the evidence that defendant became one of the beneficiaries of an insurance policy on her stepson's life days before he was killed was relevant to show her motive for murdering her stepson.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was linked to the victim's stabbing death by a blood-stained shirt and a latent fingerprint on a bloody piece of wood. Witnesses identified the shirt as one that defendant wore the night of the murder; the witnesses saw defendant again later that night wearing a different shirt. Defendant told the witnesses that he had killed a woman. Defendant was convicted and sentenced. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have understood the term &quot;moral certainty,&quot; which the trial court had included in a jury instruction at defendant's request, to be dissociated from the evidence. The language clearly directed the jury to base its decision on the evidence. The prosecutor's questions on closing argument: Where is his alibi? Where was he? did not merit a mistrial. The remarks were directed solely to defendant's failure to offer evidence to rebut the state's case and were in response to defendant's jury argument; they were not an impermissible comment on defendant's failure to testify. A tardy production of Brady material did not merit a mistrial; defendant failed to show prejudice thereby.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his motion to suppress evidence was improperly denied. Specifically, defendant argued that several pieces of evidence that were seized from his person was obtained as a result of an unconstitutional detention because police officers at an airport held him without any reasonable, articulable suspicion that he had been involved in a homicide. Defendant further contended that an incriminating statement made to a police officer should have been excluded because the statement was the result of an unconstitutional arrest. The court held that both the evidence and the incriminating statement were properly obtained. The court held that the police officers had sufficient justification to conduct an investigatory stop of defendant at the airport because the police had found the victim's car in the parking lot with its hood still warm, defendant fit the profile of the suspect in the case, and a clerk directed them to defendant who had purchased a ticket with the victim's credit card.

The trial court erred in submitting mitigating circumstances because in its instruction it varied the wording of a statutory mitigating circumstance, and the instruction permitted the jurors to decide such circumstance was without weight.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to proceed pro se. Defendant was allowed to waive in-court representation by counsel, once the statutory inquiry under N.C. Gen.

The prosecutor's proffered explanations for preemptory challenges of prospective black jurors under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1212(9) (1993), satisfied the Batson test and were not race-based when the reasons for the challenges included the jurors' lack of candor, and family that had engaged in prior felonious criminal activity. During sentencing it was not error to admit a prior crime of assault in rebuttal to defendant's evidence that he was generally of good character and as to the mitigating factors of his age, that he was a loving father of two children, and had adapted well to prison. After a proportionality review pursuant to N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court, Rockingham County (North Carolina), which imposed two death sentences on defendant on the recommendation of the jury after he was convicted of two counts of first degree murder. He was also sentenced to a prison term as to his convictions for armed robbery of the victims, which were the subject of a separate appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree murder and the trial court imposed two death sentences. Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and death sentences. The trial court did not commit error by denying defendant's motion for change of venue because defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that pretrial publicity tainted his chances of receiving a fair and impartial trial. The evidence of defendant's prior prison escape and thefts was properly admitted to establish defendant's intent and motive for the murders at issue, and the evidence was more probative than prejudicial. Defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on second degree murder because the state's evidence was positive as to each element of first degree murder and there was no conflicting evidence relating to any of the elements. The prosecutor did not deny defendant a fair trial by arguing that the jury should apply an unconstitutional definition of the reasonable doubt standard because the prosecutor's definition did not lower the state's burden of proof. Due to three aggravating factors being found, the death sentence was not disproportionate to the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions on two counts of first degree murder because the trial court's rulings were proper and sufficient evidence supported the jury's decision. The court affirmed defendant's two death sentences because they did not violate the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments and they were not disproportionate to the crimes.</SPAN></P>

After remand by the United States Supreme Court in light of a recent opinion, it was concluded by the court that a reasonable doubt instruction that had been given during defendant's trial was free from error. The case was before the court for consideration of defendant's remaining points of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction for first-degree murder and his capital sentence. The court upheld the conviction and the sentence. The court held that the trial court's ruling that the prosecutor had not exercised his peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory could not be clearly erroneous because the trial judge chose one of two permissible views of the evidence. The court held that while ex parte conferences between the trial judge and prospective jurors did violate defendant's right to be present at all stages of the trial, the resulting error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the evidence established that his presence would have made no difference in the outcome of the conversations. The court held that the trial court did not err when it submitted defendant's borderline retardation as a nonstatutory mitigating circumstance because the evidence did not mandate submission of the statutory circumstances of impaired capacity. The court held that defendant's sentence was proportionate because the court's review of other cases in the proportionality pool did not reveal that jurors had consistently returned life sentences in cases like defendant's.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of plaintiff police officers, who alleged that the city breached its contractual obligation to pay certain compensation promised in return for early retirement and also brought action for an unconstitutional impairment of contract, an unconstitutional taking, and a violation of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police officers had taken early retirement in reliance on the city manager's erroneous interpretation of new legislation,&nbsp;N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 143-166.42. After the city informed the police officers that their compensation was to be reduced, they brought suit. The court reversed the appellate court decision. The court held that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 143-166.41, 143-166.42 did not authorize the city to make separation allowances based on overtime pay, longevity pay, and accrued vacation, and that the police officers could not invoke the doctrine of estoppel to prevent the city from asserting the defense of ultra vires. The police officers' contract and constitutional actions failed because they never had a contractual right to receive payments in excess of those provided for in &sect; 143-166.41. The Manager's representations were ultra vires, or beyond the power of the city, such that they were unenforceable. Also, the city was not estopped from asserting the ultra vires defense because the Legislature never authorized the city to enter into such separation allowance contracts, such that there was an entire absence of power, where the city only had that power that the Legislature granted.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of driving while impaired. He appealed to the superior court for trial de novo and sought dismissal of the charge against him on the ground that former Chapter 74A of the General Statutes of North Carolina was unconstitutional. He argued that the statute authorized a religious institution to exercise the police power of the state because it permitted employees of a religious institution to be commissioned and function as police officers. The superior court dismissed the charges against him and ruled that former Chapter 74A was an unconstitutional entanglement of state and church. The court of appeals reversed and held the statute was constitutional on its face and as applied. On appeal, the court reversed and reinstated the dismissal of the charges. As applied, former Chapter 74A violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The state's delegation of its police power to the religious university was an unconstitutional delegation of an important discretionary power to a religious institution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's statements to a doctor were inadmissible because they were not statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment. It was harmless error for the trial court to fail to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter, because the jury was properly instructed on first and second degree murder and found defendant guilty of first degree murder based on premeditation and deliberation.

The court concluded that the evidence supported the jury's finding of the sole aggravating circumstance, that the murder was committed for pecuniary gain, and that the sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of any arbitrary factor. The court found that the proportionality pool included two cases that recognized the death penalty as a proportionate punishment for contract killings committed under remarkably similar circumstances. The court concluded that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because he consented to his attorney's decision to concede guilt to second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter. The court determined that defendant could not claim that he was prejudiced by an instruction on consideration of the statutory mitigating circumstance in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-2000(f)(6) (1988) because he invited the error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The criminal defendants claimed that the district attorney used his powers to set the criminal dockets under N.C.

The superior court had jurisdiction to hear the civil claims under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-240 (1989). The criminal defendants had standing to represent a class of those similarly situated because their claims were repetitious, yet evading review, and one case was not concluded. The statutes were constitutional under the separation of powers doctrine because the district attorney was a quasi-judicial officer and there was no intrusion on the superior court's inherent authority to manage the criminal docket. Although the statutes were constitutional under the Due Process Clause of the federal constitution and the law of the land clause under N.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 because they did not facially violate the criminal defendants' rights, the criminal defendants raised a question of fact as to whether the statutes' application violated their constitutional rights.

The court further held that although it did not approve of the prosecuting attorney's argument that used Biblical quotations, the court believed that the jurors were able to discount the promise. The Biblical quotation used by the prosecuting attorney implied to the jurors that if defendant was guilty and they convicted him they would have been blessed by God. However, the court ordered a new capital sentencing proceeding for the error by the trial court in finding the aggravating circumstance.

Appellants, county, county education board, community college, county medical authority (county entities), and the state attorney general, challenged the order of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina) that affirmed the trial court's ruling declaring the statutes unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county entities argued that the statutes were constitutional because they were general rather than local and, if local, they did not relate to health or sanitation and thus were permissible under N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24. They contended that the city required special legislative attention because the city and the county could not agree on which entity should perform the inspections of the buildings covered by the three acts. They contended this inability to agree provided a rational basis for the legislature's objective in enacting the acts, that of designating the county to perform the inspections. The court affirmed the appellate court's decision, holding that the statutes were local. Based on N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-411 and the facts of the case, the court perceived no rational basis that justified the separation of the city from all other cities in the state for special legislative attention regarding the designation of an appropriate inspection department. The court also concluded that the acts that altered the selection process of those who would enforce the building code affected health and sanitation. Thus, the acts were prohibited by N.C. Const. art. II, &sect; 24.</SPAN></P>

The adjacent landowner claimed that the statute provided sufficient notice because the statute in question was a self-executing statute and did not cause vested property rights to be reduced to a mere cause of action. The court rejected the adjacent landowner's arguments and affirmed the lower court. The court pointed out that due process required notice greater than that provided by operation of law prior to divestment of a vested property interest. The court noted that the disputed statutory language unconstitutionally transferred property from the record title holder to the adjacent landowner by creation of a presumption that, after a period of time, the title was taken from the record title holder, and transferred to the adjacent landowner without any notice or consideration. This presumption effectively forfeiting the record title holder's rights in a valuable property interest.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals (North Carolina) reversed, and based upon a severance cause in the statute struck the unconstitutional portion only. Both parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The intangibles tax paid was imposed upon the value of the stock which was the result of computing the allocable percentage of the issuing corporation's income to North Carolina, which reduced by that percentage the value of the stock for intangibles tax purposes, and similarly reduced the intangibles tax by that percentage. By analogy to another state's intangibles tax imposed on domestic corporations that owned stock in foreign corporations that did not pay property taxes in that state as being substantially equivalent, sufficient for Commerce Clause purposes, to that state's tax on the domestic corporations' property, the court held that &sect; 105-203 also satisfied the Commerce Clause. The court reasoned that &sect; 105-203, in effect reduced the corporate taxpayer's intangible tax liability directly and inversely proportionally to the issuing corporation's income allocable to North Carolina, and increased the intangibles tax to the extent the issuing corporation's income was not taxed by North Carolina. Therefore, the intangibles tax compensated for the higher income taxes paid by North Carolina corporations versus those corporations that did some business in the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and held that the North Carolina intangibles tax levied on the ownership of corporate stock did not violate the Commerce Clause because it did not discriminate against interstate commerce and in favor of intrastate commerce.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and death sentence imposed by the Superior Court, Stokes County (North Carolina), pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 7A-27(a). Defendant claimed that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a change of venue, denied his motion for funds to employ a pathologist, unconstitutionally limited the scope of defendant's voir dire, and refused to intervene ex mero motu during the prosecutors' closing arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed after he was convicted of murder and the death penalty was imposed. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and the sentence imposed. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a change of venue. The court noted that defendant had not established a reasonable likelihood that pretrial publicity prevented him from receiving a fair and impartial trial. The court ruled that defendant did not demonstrate a sufficient showing of particularized need to warrant the trial court's retaining an independent expert for the defense, that the trial court did not unconstitutionally limit the scope of defendant's voir dire, did not abuse its discretion in curtailing defendant's voir dire inquiries, did not err in denying defendant's challenge for cause of prospective jurors, and did not abuse its discretion in the conducting of the jury voir dire. The court concluded that the prosecutors' arguments were not so grossly improper as to require the trial judge to intervene ex mero motu. The court held that based on the characteristics of defendant and the crimes he committed, the death sentence imposed was not excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the trial court had committed no error in denying defendant's motion for a change of venue, in conducting the voir dire, or in conducting the trial. The court found that the sentence imposed was not disproportional or imposed because of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and affirmed defendant's conviction and the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court found no error with the superior court's decision, and held that the 10 prospective jurors were properly dismissed because they had expressed strong opposition to the death penalty and defendant had not shown that further questioning would have produced different answers on the part of the jurors. Having found no merit in defendant's remaining assignments of error, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court then proceeding to conduct the requisite proportionality examination of the capital punishment imposed by the superior court and found that the present case was more similar to several cases in which the jury had imposed the death sentence. Accordingly, the sentence of death imposed in the present case was determined not to be disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the first-degree rape and first-degree murder of a 69 year old widow. An appellate court ordered a resentencing in view of a United States Supreme Court decision. At the resentencing, the jury found as an aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed while defendant was engaged in the commission of a rape. No mitigating circumstances were found by the jury, and the jury recommended a death sentence. On appeal, defendant raised several arguments concerning instructions given by the court during the resentencing proceeding, and he also maintained that the sentence was disproportionate to the crime committed. The court held that defendant received a fair trial, and that the trial court made no prejudicial errors in its jury instructions that would justify setting aside the sentence. Additionally, the court compared the facts and circumstances of defendant's crime and the background of other cases where the death penalty had been imposed. This comparison led the court to concluded that the imposition of the death sentence upon defendant was neither disproportionate or excessive under the facts of the case. The death sentence was thus affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that because defendant's motion to dismiss did not require a jury, the trial judge was authorized to enter an order out of session. Further, plaintiffs' cause of action, for statute of limitations purposes, arose at the time defendant's billboard ordinance first became effective because it was then that the regulation injured plaintiffs' property in a clear and concrete fashion.

In its written judgment the trial court referenced the parties' ages in the factual findings. In the oral statement explaining the decision, the trial court mentioned the father's age and stated that the child's best interests were better served by placing him with the younger mother because she would live longer. The appellate court reversed the judgment on grounds that the trial court impermissibly treated the father's age as a fundamental reason for its decision. On discretionary review, the state supreme court ruled that the trial court properly considered the father's age and, moreover, the record established that the father's age was but one of several factors weighed by the trial court. Other factors, the court observed, included the father's alleged infidelity, drinking problem, and the parties' different preferences for the child's religious and educational training. The court ruled that the trial court did not impermissibly classify the father based upon his age nor did it apply a presumption against the older parent, in violation of N.C. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's challenges to jury selection, jury instructions, and sentencing. A juror who gave conflicting answers about the death penalty was properly excluded. Defendant had adequate opportunity to question jurors about mental illness and retardation. Evidence supported each element of first-degree murder and did not support a second-degree murder instruction; evidence of defendant's mild retardation and organic brain disorder was not presented until sentencing. Instructions that allowed the jury to infer premeditation and deliberation from a lack of provocation correctly placed the burden of proving those elements on the state. Evidence did not support an instruction on voluntary intoxication. A state statute requiring a trial court to instruct a jury during capital sentencing about parole eligibility was not in effect at the time of trial and did not apply. The trial court properly submitted as aggravating circumstances that the two murders were committed as part of a course of conduct. Despite defendant's IQ of 69, the death penalty was not unconstitutional. The death penalty was not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.</SPAN></P>

After reviewing the resentencing phase of defendant's trial and finding that no error occurred, the court concluded that the record supported the jury's finding of the single aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed for the purpose of collecting life insurance proceeds. The court then determined that it could not hold as a matter of law that defendant's death sentence was disproportionate or excessive. Unlike the other cases involving the single aggravating circumstance of pecuniary gain, defendant had pre-planned the murder over a lengthy period of time and coldly calculated the brutal assault. The killing was unprovoked, defendant showed no remorse or pity after the murder, and he was not found to be under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance.</SPAN></P>

The court similarly rejected as meritless defendant's challenge to the denial of his suppression motion, the refusal to allow him to refresh a witness' recollection, and the refusal to permit the testimony of the public defender. With respect to sentencing issues, the court concluded that each of the challenged jury instructions was appropriate, as they comported with the relevant law and the jury was able to follow the instructions as they were given. The court further found that none of the challenged remarks made during closing argument sufficiently prejudiced defendant as to warrant reversal.

By attacking the victim's character for marital fidelity, defendant went beyond what was necessary for his defense and opened the door to the rebuttal evidence.

There was no error in denying the request to submit a possible verdict on second degree murder to the jury.

The court held that the trial court did not commit reversible error even though it denied defendant's request to interrogate the jurors as to whether they could follow an instruction that a life sentence actually meant a life sentence that was not subject to parole. The court held that defendant had the right to such an interrogation, however the trial court's error did not amount to a prejudicial error because all of the selected jurors were present when two potential jurors indicated that they felt that a life sentence meant that defendant would eventually be paroled. The court held that because the selected jurors did not indicate that they agreed with the two potential jurors that were excused, it was probable that they did not consider the possibility of parole in their ultimate decision to impose the death penalty. The court held that videotape of defendant committing a robbery in conjunction with the murder was properly admitted even though defendant had pled guilty to the robbery because the video was relevant to show defendant's motive for the murder.</SPAN></P>

On direct appeal, his convictions for murder, robbery, and assault were affirmed, but his death sentence was vacated and remanded. On review, the court found that the state used peremptory challenges in a race-neutral way. The state's objections as to form of questions about whether prospective jurors could consider a life sentence if they found that mitigating outweighed aggravating circumstances were sustained because, among other things, some of the questions were not properly phrased. The trial court properly excused a juror for cause where her responses indicated that her feelings about the death penalty would prevent her from following the law. It was error to refuse to submit the mitigating circumstance that in prison, defendant could abide by the rules, but any error was harmless as to the failure to submit the circumstance because a different result would not have been reached at sentencing. Objections to jury instructions were overruled for reasons including that the instructions were a correct statement of the law of mitigation. Finding no error, the court affirmed the sentence, holding it was proportionate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former federal employees and active duty federal military personnel and reservists contended they were entitled to full refunds for income taxes paid by them on pension benefits for the tax years 1985 through 1988 because the state statute exempting state employees' retirement benefits from taxation but not granting the same exemption to their federal counterparts violated the constitutional doctrines of intergovernmental tax immunity and 4 U.S.C.S. &sect; 111. The court concluded the former federal employees and active duty federal military personnel and reservists were procedurally barred from recovering the refunds sought because they failed to comply with the state's statutory postpayment refund demand procedure, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 105-267 (1992). The court further held that the refund procedure provided in &sect; 105-267 was free from any constitutional infirmity and that it could, therefore, effectively bar actions for refunds in the tax years for which the procedure was not followed.

The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction and sentence.

The court also rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in admitting autopsy photographs, holding that although some of the photos were gruesome, they were relevant to illustrate the testimony of the pathologist and were illustrative of the nature of the victim's wounds. The court held that the admission into evidence of knives taken from defendant's residence were relevant and that the trial court did not err by refusing to grant defendant's motion for a directed verdict and in instructing the jury on the definition of malice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant exhausted his peremptory challenges but did not renew his challenge for cause. He thus foreclosed appeal of the trial court's denial of a challenge for cause.

The state was not bound by an exculpatory statement that it introduced if there was other evidence tending to throw a different light on the circumstances of the homicide. Such other evidence included the absence of any knives the victim could have used, defendant's previous threat to shoot a man he saw in the house, and defendant's initial statements that he killed two people, which did not include any self-defense claim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's imposition of a death sentence upon the jury's recommendation after defendant pled guilty to murder. The jury found aggravating circumstances in that defendant's crime was heinous, atrocious, or cruel where the victim died a slow and painful death, was kidnapped, beaten and sexually assaulted by defendant, and the murder was part of a course of conduct in which defendant engaged and included similar crimes of violence against women. The jury did find mitigating circumstances in defendant's law abiding history and medical testimony regarding defendant's brain damage from an aneurysm and subsequent surgery. The court refused to set aside the sentence because it found defendant's sentence was not disproportionate and not the result of the actions of an aberrant jury. The court rejected defendant's claims of error regarding mental examinations provided to the state, unrecorded bench conferences, the denial of individual voir dire, denial of requested jury instructions regarding life imprisonment and the death penalty, and the admission of victim photographs, victim impact statements and defendant's statements of other crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court declined to set aside defendant's death sentence because the sentence was not disproportionate and there was no indication that it was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors. The court held that the evidence supported the jury's findings of aggravating circumstances where the victim was kidnapped and sexually assaulted, and the crime was part of a course of conduct of similar crimes by defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant killed them and burglarized their home. Defendant was charged with and convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court did not err in excusing jurors who were opposed the death penalty, in denying defendant an opportunity to rehabilitate panelists similarly opposed, or in refusing to suppress defendant's statements due to a lack of counsel. Defendant was given a proper first appearance pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-601. Breaking and entering need not be submitted as a lesser included offense of burglary, and no error in failing to submit that defendant had no significant history of prior criminal activity. Defense counsel told the court they were avoiding it for strategic purposes. There was no duplication in submitting aggravating factor questions. There was sufficient evidence to support a submission that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel. There was no error in the prosecutor arguing in favor of death so defendant could not commit more crimes, or in referring to the Sixth Commandment in his argument.</SPAN></P>

Further, the court held that there was not any evidence to show that defendant was provoked. The court held that the trial court did not err in instructing the jury on felony murder because the crime of burglary with explosives, as defined N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-57, was a &quot;burglary&quot; within the purview of the felony murder statute. The court rejected defendant's contention that he was denied the right to represent himself, holding that defendant did not request to proceed pro se with sufficient clarity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, neighboring county and its zoning administrator, appealed a decision of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which reversed a decision granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff county and declaring a landfill zoning ordinance unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A county and individuals filed an action for declaratory relief, seeking to have a neighboring county's zoning ordinance declared unconstitutional. The court of appeals reversed the judgment finding the ordinance unconstitutional and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the decision of whether to permit a sanitary landfill was an administrative zoning decision. The county's grant of a permit application that passed the ordinance county was an administrative zoning decision that the county zoning administrator could properly make. It was not an impermissible conflict of interest because the applicant for the permit was the county itself. The same logic that permitted the county commissioners to delegate authority to the zoning administrator to issue special use permits also supported the decision that the commissioners had authority to allow the zoning administrator to issue permits for uses by right subject to special requirements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment reversing the decision finding the county landfill ordinance unconstitutional was affirmed because it was a valid legislative prerogative to change the sanitary landfill use from a &quot;special use permit&quot; category to a &quot;use by right under prescribed conditions&quot; category. The ordinance, which allowed the zoning administrator to approve the permit application for siting of a landfill, was constitutional and lawful on its face.</SPAN></P>

The court of appeals vacated the trial court judgment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The State petitioned for review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The first group of descendants asserted the 1962 deed was ineffective to convey the property due to noncompliance with the private examination statutes in effect at the time of conveyance. The first group claimed instead that title continued to both the husband and wife as tenants by the entirely and that upon the husband's death the property passed to the wife individually by operation of law. In such case, the first group argued, the property descended upon the wife's death by virtue of her intestacy to the five children in five equal parts rather than passing in six shares as directed by the husband's will and codicil. On appeal, the court ruled the second group of descendants had standing to challenge the statutes in question. The court noted the examination requirement allowed a wife to void a transaction into which she otherwise competently had entered on the sole basis that the contract was not certified by the clerk of the court. The court ruled the private examination statutes required unequal application of the law at the time the 1962 deed was executed and were unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff corporations filed suit for a declaratory judgment asserting that the Refund Anticipation Loan Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53-245 to 53-254 violated the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The Superior Court, Wake County (North Carolina), denied the corporations' motion for summary judgment and entered summary judgment in favor of defendant state bank commissioner. The corporations sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporations argued that Congress legislated so comprehensively that it had left no room for supplementary state legislation on refund anticipation loans (RAL). The corporations cited 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 6011(e) and Rev. Proc. 90-62, 1990-2 C.B. at 663 in support of their argument. The corporations also argued that the Refund Anticipation Loan Act violated the Supremacy Clause because it infringed upon and interfered with business operations of out-of-state banks. The court rejected the corporations' arguments. The court held that 26 U.S.C.S. &sect; 6011(e) pertained only to electronic filing. Further, Rev. Proc. 90-62, 1990-2 C.B. at 663 was superseded by Rev. Proc. 91-69, 1991-2 C.B. at 897. Neither authority cited by the corporations specifically mentioned RALs. Moreover, revenue procedures were without legal effect in Supremacy Clause challenges. The court found that the Refund Anticipation Loan Act did not place an undue burden on interstate commerce. The court ruled that the burden on interstate commerce was only incidental, that the burden did not exceed the local benefits, and no pervasive federal regulatory scheme existed for RALs.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 45-21.16(d) (1991), before foreclosure may commence. The lender had attempted foreclosure on the property of the mortgagor. The lender assigned as error the trial court's denial of its authority to proceed under the terms of the Deed of Trust to conduct a sale pursuant to the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect;45.21.16(d). The lender contended that a right to foreclose under the instrument should have been read narrowly so that if a deed of trust simply contained the requisite wording constituting a power of sale in the event of a default, then there was per se a right to foreclose under the instrument. The court disagreed with this contention and affirmed. The court stated that in order for a trustee under a deed of trust to have any right to foreclose on a parcel of land the deed of trust must encompass the subject property as security for the debt owed by the mortgagor.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated and remanded the sentence of death and affirmed the convictions and the non-capital sentences. The court found that there was sufficient evidence presented to support defendant's first-degree kidnapping conviction because he only released the victim to the police after the police cornered him. The court concluded that the trial judge's instruction during defendant's sentencing, which required the jury to unanimously agree on each mitigating factor before applying it, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the non-capital sentences as there was sufficient evidence that defendant was not honorably discharged from the military and therefore the lower court did not err in failing to find the statutory mitigating factor.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then admitted killing his wife, but denied that he had planned to kill her. The court found no prejudicial error in the conviction and affirmed the imposition of life imprisonment. Defendant did not show plain error as to jury instructions given because, even if the jurors had been told about the qualifications of one witness, the jury would have reached the same result. Defendant's failure to object to questions by the prosecutor meant waiver of the attorney-client privilege, which defendant did not raise. Nor was plain error committed when defendant's neighbor was allowed to testify that defendant's wife constantly complained and belittled defendant because defendant did not meet the burden of proving that the cross-examination resulted in an error so grave as to cause the jury to reach a decision it would not have reached absent the testimony. Finally, a life imprisonment sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the bench conferences did not violate defendant's rights because they were attended by his attorneys, and it was not necessary to record bench conferences between trial judges and attorneys. The court found that the trial court gave an unconstitutional instruction that required the jury to find mitigating circumstance unanimously, and the state did not demonstrate that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, so the sentencing proceeding was constitutionally infirm and the instruction might have prevented one or more jurors from finding mitigating circumstance existed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) it was reversible error for the trial court to conduct a private conversation with the juror; (2) the substance of the conversation between the trial court and the juror was not revealed nor did the trial court reconstruct it at trial and thus the state could not demonstrate that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; and (3) the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for a state-paid mental health expert on the ground that defendant was not represented by court-appointed counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that although the trial court erred in not submitting one statutory mitigating factor, that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because none of the jurors would have found that circumstance to exist. The court held that the jury received the unanimity instruction found unconstitutional in McKoy. The court held that the state met its burden of showing that error was harmless because the trial court clerk's poll of the jury foreman and individual jury members demonstrated that the jury unanimously found only 1 of the 10 mitigating circumstances applied to defendant. The court held that the jury poll demonstrated unequivocally that the instruction did not prevent any juror's consideration of defendant's mitigating evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a jury trial in the Superior Court, Wilkes County (North Carolina), which convicted defendant of first-degree murder and robbery with a dangerous weapon. The court granted defendant's motion to bypass the Court of Appeals. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to suppress certain inculpatory statements and in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction stemmed from the discovery of the dead body of a restaurant bank manager in her car outside of a local bank, and the theft of two bank deposit bags that had been in the victim's possession. On appeal, the court held (1) the police did not conduct a custodial interrogation and defendant thus was not entitled to Miranda warnings prior to his subsequent confession to the murder, (2) defendant's confession was voluntarily made after being advised fully of his Miranda rights, (3) the trial court did not err in denying defendant's pretrial motions for authorization of a private investigator and an ex parte hearing at which to apply for funds to employ expert assistance, (4) there was no abuse of discretion in the admission of 52 color photographs of the crime scene and the victim's body, (5) the evidence was insufficient to warrant a jury instruction on voluntary intoxication, and (6) the trial court erred in denying defendant's request to submit to the jury the possible verdict of second-degree murder based on evidence that defendant may have killed the victim with malice but without premeditation and deliberation in the course of the robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the trial court's conviction of defendant for first-degree murder under the felony murder rule. As a result of the trial court's error in refusing to instruct the jury on second-degree murder, the court arrested judgment on the conviction for the underlying felony, robbery with a dangerous weapon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board declined to accept the judge's notice of candidacy for a seat on a state appellate court that was currently occupied. Thereafter, the judge filed an action for injunctive relief and mandamus against the Board and its individual members. The trial court entered judgment for the judge and issued a writ of mandamus ordering the Board to conduct an election. The Board had predicated its decision on the basis of eight-year judicial commissions that the governor had granted to certain appellate judges that had filled vacancies midway through the prior judge's term. On appeal, the court endeavored to determine if N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 163-9, which provided that an election to a judicial vacancy permitted the elected judge to serve only for the unexpired term, violated N.C. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16. The court in turn determined that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 163-9 was not prohibited by the North Carolina Constitution and was a lawful exercise of legislative power. Since the eight-year commissions issued by the governor were inconsistent with the statute, they were invalid. Thus, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the authority of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 163-125, the election board refused to allow two mayoral candidates to file for the office of mayor until they resigned their seats on the town council. The court held that &sect; 163-125, the &quot;resign to run&quot; statute, was contrary to the express terms of N.C. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6. The mayoral candidates were qualified voters in North Carolina, who were not disqualified from elective office by any provision of the state constitution. Thus, they were eligible for election by the people to office under the express language of N.C. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6. The legislative attempt to require the resignation of those having the mayoral candidates' status as holders of another elective office imposed an additional qualification for elective office, not provided by the state constitution, and thus, failed to pass constitutional muster.</SPAN></P>

The two classifications of taxpayers that received favorable treatment under the state income tax laws were reasonable and not arbitrary.

The court observed that a statutory provision was made for an action against the state, the procedure described by the statute had to be followed, and the remedies afforded were exclusive. The court further noted a constitutional defense to the validity of a tax did not exempt appellants from the mandatory procedure for challenging the tax. The court found in the present case all class demand letters were preceded by the filing of the complaint, and as a result, appellants failed to satisfy the condition precedent of demanding a refund before instituting an action against the revenue secretary. The court further found that absent specific statutory authorization for class or representative refund demands, such demands were ineffectual to satisfy the demand condition precedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed in part summary judgment for respondent agents, but reversed partial summary judgment in favor of appellant class, and remanded for entry of summary judgment in favor of respondent state revenue agency, for appellants' action challenging the validity of taxes collected under the repealed tax exemption was foreclosed by the failure to comply with statutory condition precedent to instituting such an action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff attorney sought review of a decision of the Superior Court, Watauga County (North Carolina), which granted summary judgment in favor of defendants, governor, attorney general, and bar president, in the attorney's action alleging that N.C.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was not considered for district judge because of his political party affiliation. He filed an action asserting that &sect; 7A-142, which governed the appointment of persons to fill the unexpired terms of district court judges, violated the Constitution of North Carolina by placing the additional qualification of candidates that they were to be the same political party as the vacating judge. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the governor, attorney general, and bar president. On appeal, the court affirmed. Unless the constitution expressly or by necessary implication restricted the actions of the legislative branch, the General Assembly was free to implement legislation as long as that legislation did not offend some specific constitutional provision. N.C. Const. art. VI, &sect; 6 did expressly limit disqualifications to office for those who were elected by the people to those disqualifications set out in the constitution. However, no provision of the constitution so limited disqualifications to office for those who were appointed, whether the appointment were for a purely appointive office or to fill the unexpired term of an elective office.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the jury was not instructed that they were permitted to take into account any mitigating circumstances under the McKoy standard. After a hearing, the court agreed, vacated the sentence, and remanded the case to the superior court for a new sentencing hearing. The court held that (1) even though the same evidence supporting the mental or emotional disturbance circumstances were considered by the jury on the rejected impaired capacity circumstance, the McKoy error was not rendered harmless; (2) it would not have been inconsistent for one or more jurors, considering the same evidence in support of both circumstances, to find that defendant was mentally or emotionally disturbed but that his capacity to appreciate his conduct's criminality or to conform his conduct to law was not impaired; and (3) the trial court did not err in failing to permit the introduction of voluntary intoxication evidence to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a class action, the Superior Court, Wake County (North Carolina) rendered judgment for plaintiff taxpayers holding defendant, state and its officers and agencies, liable for refunds for taxes paid on federal pensions or military pay before a precedent was decided. The state and its officers and agencies appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the precedent did not apply retroactively because (1) it was a case of first impression; (2) the decision was not clearly foreshadowed as evidenced by the fact that 23 states had plans similar to the exemption of state employees from taxation of their pensions, which had been in effect since 1941 without court challenge; (3) retroactive application would have no effect on the operation of the principle that the precedent would advance because the general assembly repealed the provisions of the tax system at which the precedent was aimed; (4) the state acted reasonably under the law as it was then understood when it exempted the benefits of state pensioners from income tax and it excluded part of the pay of National Guardsmen and it would be inequitable to require the state to refund the taxes paid by federal pensioners and military personnel in light of the state's dire financial straits and the cost of refunds. The rule the court applied to decide whether the precedent was retroactive was invoked by pleading no retroactive relief. The state did not waive its right to refuse a refund of these taxes. The taxpayers were not entitled to refunds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed that he beat the victim, drove him to a field, and stabbed him in the chest. The court rejected defendant's juror selection challenges. One juror was properly excused for views on the death penalty, one was too emotional, and one worked with defendant's mother. Evidence of defendant's racism was admissible to prove motive. Photographs of the victim's maggot-infested, decomposing body were not used excessively or solely to arouse the jury's passions. Defendant's confession established a conspiracy, so statements by his co-conspirator were admissible against defendant even though conspiracy was not charged. Defendant's statement to officers that he did not care if he received capital punishment was relevant to his state of mind when he confessed. Admission of hearsay evidence from two officers about statements made by defendant and his co-conspirator was harmless error; the statements were corroborated by other witnesses. In the penalty phase, it was reversible error to instruct the jurors that they had to unanimously find there was evidence of defendant's impaired capacity before they could consider that mitigating factor in making a sentencing decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment by the Superior Court, Alamance County (North Carolina), which convicted him of first-degree murder of his girlfriend's son whose death was caused by water intoxication. Defendant contended that there was insufficient evidence presented of premeditation and deliberation and of murder by torture and that the trial court's instructions on murder by torture were inadequate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, finding the record showed defendant had developed a pattern of using extraordinary methods to punish and humiliate the boy and the boy's death was a result of a disciplinary method. The court found testimony by a witness qualified as an expert in pediatric critical care medicine was admissible under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 702(1988). The court held the qualification of an expert witness was left to the sound discretion of the trial judge. The expert's testimony as to the ultimate issue under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 704 (1988) was not objectionable and the testimony that utilized several legal terms and concepts was proper. The court held defendant admitted he coerced the boy to drink large quantities of water, which ultimately caused the death. The court held that malice was not a prerequisite of murder by torture under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-17, which was classified as first-degree murder as there was no reference to malice. Since murder was not defined by statute, the trial court employed the common law definition under N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-1(1986) and neither premeditation nor deliberation was an element of the crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for murder in the first degree and conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree as a result of the stabbing death of her husband. She was found guilty of conspiracy and murder in the second degree. The State appealed from the appellate court's holding that the trial court had erred by submitting as a possible verdict murder in the second degree. The appellate court affirmed the conspiracy conviction. The court affirmed the judgment below. It held that the trial court erred in submitting the possible verdict of murder in the second degree, as the evidence supported only a possible verdict of murder in the first degree. The court concluded that the evidence against defendant was not overwhelming because it could have raised doubts in the minds of reasonable jurors. The court noted that, had not the inviting verdict of murder in the second degree been available to the jury, the verdict may well have been one of not guilty. Because the State failed to prove that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the court held that defendant was prejudiced by the trial court's error and that her conviction for murder in the second degree was properly reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder on the basis of premeditation and deliberation and felony murder. He was also convicted of robbery with a dangerous weapon. The jury recommended that defendant be sentenced to death for the first degree murder. The Superior Court, Richmond County (North Carolina), imposed a sentence of death for the murder and arrested judgment on the robbery charge. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that no prejudicial errors had occurred during the guilt phase of the trial. However, the court did find that the trial court had erroneously instructed the jury regarding its deliberations on the mitigating factors presented by the defendant. The trial court instructed the jury that it could not consider any circumstance in mitigation of the offense unless the jury unanimously concluded that the circumstance had been proved. The trial court then instructed the jury to answer &quot;no&quot; to each mitigating circumstance that it failed to find unanimously. The court determined that, under the circumstances, the error was not harmless because the court could not conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the erroneous unanimity instruction did not preclude one or more jurors from considering, as mitigation, defendant's good work record or his diminished capacity to appreciate the criminality of his act or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. Nor could the court conclude that the jury, acting under proper instructions, would nevertheless have imposed the death penalty. Accordingly, defendant was entitled to a new sentencing proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed. The judgment of sentence was reversed and the case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina), which affirmed his conviction for second degree murder and the denial of his motion to dismiss the charges. Defendant contended, inter alia, that the murder charge against him should have been dismissed under the common law &quot;year and a day&quot; rule because uncontroverted evidence showed that the victim had died 14 months after the collision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was driving under the influence when his car struck a couple's car.

On appeal, he contended that the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss the charges based on the common law &quot;year and a day&quot; rule. The court reversed and held that the year and a day rule was obsolete within the meaning of that term as used in N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-1, and was no longer part of the common law of North Carolina for any purpose. The court concluded that because of the prohibitions against ex post facto laws embodied in U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, its decision abolishing the year and a day rule had prospective effect only. Thus, defendant's conviction for second-degree murder was in error. However, the court further ruled that, in finding defendant guilty of second-degree murder, the jury necessarily had to find facts establishing the lesser-included offense of involuntary manslaughter, and it remanded for a judgment of guilt of involuntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court neither abused its discretion nor violated the defendant's constitutional rights in denying his motion for a continuance to locate a witness to testify on his defense of self-defense. The court found that the State was not culpable because the government had made extensive efforts to locate the witness after serving him with a subpoena. The evidence indicated that the witness had gone into hiding and was unlikely to appear in a reasonable time. The court found that the defendant had the benefit of a substantial portion of the witness's pretrial statements made to the sheriff's department and to his counsel. The court held that a deputy sheriff's testimony as to what the murder victim told him on the day he died was admissible under the residual exception to the hearsay rule. The court reasoned that the victim was in fear of his life, that he was proceeding to the magistrate's office when he was killed, and his unavailability was a result of his death at the hands of the defendant.</SPAN></P>

He also claimed that his death sentence should be vacated because of an improper jury instruction. The court upheld defendant's convictions, but held that he was entitled to a new sentencing proceeding on the first degree murder conviction. In so holding, the court ruled that (1) the circumstantial evidence complained of was relevant and admissible, and the weight to be given it was for the jury to decide; and (2) the trial judge erred in instructing the jury to find unanimously each mitigating circumstance before considering that circumstance in the ultimate sentencing decision.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the company entered a contract with local school boards to have the program aired in those school systems.

Subsequently, the State sought to have the contracts declared void. The superior court dismissed the State's complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and ruled that the contracts were not invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable. The State sought discretionary review. On review, the court held that (1) the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the State's complaint; (2) the State did not have the authority to enact the temporary rule concerning the contracts, because the contracts involve the selection and procurement of supplementary materials, which was an area that the general assembly had specifically placed under the control and supervision of the local school boards; and (3) the contracts did not violate the state constitution or the state's public policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, taxpayer association and taxpayers, appealed a grant of summary judgment by the Superior Court, Wayne County (North Carolina) in favor of defendants, board of commissioners and commissioners, claiming that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-20 was unconstitutional and that defendants did not comply with the provisions of the statute in entering into a contract granting a security interest in real property that was subject to improvement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants entered into an installment purchase contract and granted the lender a security interest in the property. Plaintiffs brought an action challenging defendants' compliance with N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-20 and alleging that the statute was unconstitutional. They claimed that it was possible for defendants to be forced to appropriate money in the future to make contractual payments. The trial court granted summary judgment for defendants and dismissed the action. The court, after allowing the parties' joint petition to bypass the appellate court, held that the statute was constitutional. The court found that the statute barred the pledging of the taxing power to secure moneys due under a contract covered by the statute. It also clearly authorized the method of financing used by defendants, which by implication included the payment of the debt incurred. The court rejected the argument that the statute unconstitutionally allowed defendants to enter into an agreement under which they expended tax revenues in future years without a vote of the people. The court concluded that in an installment purchase contract, only the property was pledged, not the taxing power of the county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment for defendants.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, county and sewer district, appealed from an order of the Court of Appeals (North Carolina) which held that the county's ordinance requiring the plaintiff property owners connection to sewer system to be void, instructed the county to reimburse the property owners for fees paid, and dissolved monetary judgments entered. The court of appeals also affirmed a trial court's holding which relieved the property owners of connection charges.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Property owners refused to connect their properties to a sewer system and brought a cause of action for a declaratory judgment and injunction. The county and sewer district counterclaimed for an order requiring the property owners to connect their properties to the county-owned sewer system. The court reversed the decision of the court of appeals that voided the ordinance requiring the property owners to connect to the county-owned sewer system because the requirements of due process found in N.C. Const. art. 1, &sect; 19 were met and the ordinance was a valid exercise of the county's police power. The court found that the requiring notice and opportunity for hearing to all individual property owners prior to the adoption of an ordinance mandating connection of improved properties pursuant to the enabling act would be burdensome, costly to local governments, and not consistent with procedures employed in the exercise of other police powers. Specifically, the court held that the law of the land clause does not require notice and opportunity for hearing prior to the passage of an ordinance mandating connection to a sewer system adopted under the authority of N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 153A-284.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the court off appeals was reversed because the statute and the ordinances pertaining to sewer connection, which were passed without notice and an opportunity to be heard and which mandate connections to the sewer lines as well as the payment of related connection charges and user fees, are consistent with federal procedural due process protections and are a valid exercise of the police power.</SPAN></P>

The statute was a valid regulation, which generally tended to secure the public health, safety, and general welfare, and its plain language permitted the board to act against any departure from acceptable medical practice, irrespective of whether or not a patient was injured.

On further review, the court reversed and held that the landowners were deprived of a fundamental right to vote on equal terms. Moreover, the district did not demonstrate that the classification of voters was necessary to promote a compelling interest. The court concluded that the clerk could have had elected, rather than appointed commissioners. The court further determined that N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 156-138.3 violated the law of the land clause of the N.C. Const. insofar as it imposed assessments on landowners within the district without giving them notice and an opportunity to be heard.

Noting that only defendant and his victim were likely to have firsthand knowledge of their domestic difficulties, the court ruled that her attorney's recitation of the victim's accounts were the most probative evidence of any available to the state regarding the domestic problems. The court ruled that the use of parts of the indictment to give the jury the bare particulars of the case did not give them a distorted view of the case before them by an initial exposure to the case through the stilted language of indictments and other pleadings.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced accordingly, adding three years imprisonment for the conspiracy charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confessed to murdering the victim and that the victim's wife, with whom he was living with, wanted to have the victim murdered. The court concluded that defendant received a fair trial free of prejudicial error.

Stat. &sect; 15A-1241 and N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 15A-1231(b) might have constituted an error, the court found that defendant failed to show he was prejudiced by the error. The court also ruled that the trial court properly admitted defendant's statements made to the police at his residence on the night of the murder because he was not in custody or under arrest at the time he made the statement, and the statement was not the product of questions or interrogation by the officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no prejudicial error in the guilt phase of defendant's trial, and as such, upheld his conviction for first degree murder and common law conspiracy to commit murder.

The court reversed concluding defendants' felonious breaking or entering and felonious larceny sentences were proper because the judgments were arrested only because those offenses formed the offenses upon which the convictions of felony murder were predicated. Once a new trial was ordered on appeal of the felony murder conviction, it was no longer necessary to arrest judgment on the underlying felonies. When the state elected not to pursue the charge of murder in the first degree based on felonious breaking or entering and felonious larceny as the predicate felonies, there was no legal impediment to the imposition of sentences on those convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A North Carolina trial court held that Raleigh, N.C., Raleigh City Code &sect; 10-3073 was a valid exercise of defendant city's authority, which did not constitute a taking against plaintiff developer, and ordered the developer to convey the disputed land to intervenor homeowners' association (association). The developer appealed. The association appealed the exclusion of certain evidence and the denial of individual home owners' intervention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the developer sought to build on land that was initially set aside as a common area, the city refused to process his application and ordered him to convey the land to the association. On appeal, the court held that the city could order the conveyance pursuant to the ordinance. N.C. Gen. Stat. &sect; 160A-372 permitted the ordinance to provide for the conveyance of the common area when the conveyance was set aside in the approved initial plat and was all that was left to complete the approved project. The ordinance was reasonably related to the purpose of preserving open space and did not constitute a taking. The term &quot;common area&quot; that was contained in the declaration of covenants was a latently ambiguous description of the property. Reference to the preliminary plat and landscaping plat was proper to identify the boundaries of the common area. Individual home owners were proper, but not necessary parties because the association adequately represented their interests. However, the association lacked standing to prosecute claims for fraud and unfair trade practices because the damages would have varied amongst its members and deprived them of an alternative remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that ordered the developer to convey the land to the association, but reversed the decision that denied parol evidence to determine the boundaries of the common area. The court affirmed the denial of individual home owners' intervention and the association's lack of standing. The court remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged and convicted of murder in the first degree. The Superior Court, Person County (North Carolina), upon the recommendation of the jury, sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed and raised numerous assignments of error in both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Evidence of defendant's strangulation of another victim was admissible under N.C. R. Evid. 404(b) for the purpose of showing preparation, plan, or knowledge because it was virtually identical prior misconduct that occurred less than three days before the instant offense. The repetition of defendant's photograph and the discrepancy in its size compared to others presented in the pretrial identification procedure was unlikely to have led to the witnesses' misidentification of defendant. Testimony by the victims' parents of their receipt of a collect telephone call from the victim shortly before her death was properly admitted because the parents were able to identify her voice. The submission to the jury of the facts that defendant had previously been convicted of a felony involving the use of violence to the person and that the victim's murder was part of a course of conduct that included the commission of other crimes of violence as aggravating circumstances was supported by the evidence. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in requesting the jury to resume its deliberations upon being informed that it was hung after deliberating on the sentence for nearly four hours.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgments of conviction and sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff land owner filed an action against defendant town arising from its denial of a permit to subdivide her land. The trial court granted summary judgment to plaintiff. The court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court found that it was error to join the proceeding pursuant to the writ of certiorari with the cause of action alleged in the plaintiff's complaint. As a result, the court considered the questions separately. The court found that the trial court was sitting as a court of appeals when it reviewed the decision of defendant, therefore, it erred in making findings of facts and should have determined if defendant's decision was based upon findings of fact supported by competent evidence and whether such findings supported the conclusion. The evidence on which defendant based its decision was competent, material and substantial, and defendant had authority to require plaintiff to consider future plans. The court reversed the court of appeals and determined that the summary judgment on the issues of plaintiff's complaint were improperly granted because defendant did not improperly deny her permit.</SPAN></P>
