</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant brought an action seeking to enjoin the Metropolitan Plan Commission, which had been established by An Act for the Development Through Planning and Zoning of Metropolitan Areas, Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 53-902 et seq. (Supp. 1964). Appellant claimed that the Act was in conflict with Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 19, which required that every act had to embrace but one subject and matters properly connected therewith and that an Act's failure to express a subject in its title rendered that subject not expressed void. The trial court entered judgment denying the injunction. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the title to the Act was sufficient to inform anyone reading the same that the Act related to the planning and zoning of metropolitan areas which zoning would, of necessity, be effectuated through local boards, which had to have authority to make appropriate rules and regulations, and to administer and adjudicate the same subject to appeal to the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The memorandum for the motion to quash argued that the charge was too indefinite and uncertain and did not point out with sufficient detail the particular act of sodomy with which defendant was charged in either count. Defendant also argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict. In affirming the decision, the court found that the charge was sufficient. The meaning of the boy's testimony was left to the jury. The jury found defendant guilty. The evidence showed without question that defendant did entice, allure, and instigate the boy, age 14, to commit the act of masturbation. The evidence fully sustained the verdict that found a violation of Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-4221 (1956). Additionally, there was no showing that the prosecuting attorney knowingly used any perjured testimony. There also was no showing that defendant was in any way prejudiced by the time granted pursuant to Ind. Sup. Ct. R. 1-15 to the prosecuting attorney to file counter-affidavits to the charge that he was guilty of misconduct by using alleged perjured testimony.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant citizens sought review of a judgment of the Lake Superior Court (Indiana), which denied their petition for an injunction to prevent appellees, officials of the Town of Cedar Lake, Indiana, from taking any action in their official capacities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A petition to incorporate the Town was filed pursuant to Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 48-101 to 48-109 (1963), but certain residents did not receive notice by mail as provided by &sect; 48-106. The citizens filed a petition with the Commissioners of Lake County to reject the incorporation petition, but the Commissioners adopted an ordinance incorporating the Town. The citizens filed suit challenging the ordinance, which was declared to be void because of the notice defect. The General Assembly then passed 1965 Ind. Acts 283, p. 779, which declared the Town's incorporation to be valid. The citizens filed the instant action for an injunction, but the trial court found that the Act cured the defects in the incorporation. On appeal, the court rejected the citizens' contention that the notice provision of Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-106 was &quot;jurisdictional.&quot; The court expressly overruled Strosser v. The City of Fort Wayne, 100 Ind. 443 (1885), insofar as it was in conflict. The Act was a valid curative statute that did not unconstitutionally interfere with the earlier judgment or constitute special legislation.</SPAN></P>

The Board brought an action against the trial court seeking a writ of prohibition preventing it from hearing the injunction suit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with registering a motor vehicle without submitting a valid receipt from the county treasurer in violation of 1961 Ind. Act ch. 345, &sect; 15, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47-2602b (1965). When defendant filed a motion for discharge, the trial court granted the motion on the grounds that &sect; 47-2602b was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the statute violated Ind. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1, which provided for a uniform and equal rate of assessment and taxation. In reaching that conclusion, the court noted that it had previously declared invalid a portion of the Act of 1961, which provided for a tax of two per cent on the value of motor vehicles and mobile homes in lieu of the ad valorem property tax. Although statutes were to be construed so as to modify them where constitutional objections were presented, the court was required to declare the entire statute invalid. Because &sect; 47-2602b expressly provided a penalty for the failure to pay the excise tax and it could not be severed from the remainder of the Act, it was invalid and defendant could not be prosecuted for the failure to comply with its terms.</SPAN></P>

Although defendant's counsel was apparently confused as to the reason and procedure for the motion, he complied, and the trial court sustained the motion to quash. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that defendant was not entitled to relief because he failed to show that he had standing to contest the constitutionality of the Act. Specifically, defendant failed to show he was harmed or was about to be harmed by any unconstitutional provision contained in the Act. Further, legislation was presumed constitutional and the Indiana General Assembly had the power to define crimes and to specify the punishment to be imposed. After applying the ordinary meanings to the words within the title of the Act, the court noted that the offenses charged in the two affidavits came within the purview of the title to the Act and that the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The railroads sought to enjoin enforcement of the Indiana Full Crew Law. They alleged that the United States Congress's adoption of Pub. L. No. 88-108, 77 Stat. 132 (1963), preempted the field in which the Full Crew Law was designed to operate. The trial court granted the railroads a temporary injunction. The court took judicial notice of the fact that the United States Supreme Court, having determined that Pub. L. No. 88-108 did not supersede state laws and that classification according to mileage in state laws similar to the Full Crew Law did not constitute discrimination against interstate commerce, had decided those issues adversely to the railroads. The court held that the Full Crew Law was constitutionally valid. Even if the railroads' allegations of changed conditions such as the changeover from steam to diesel power, less-than-carload lots of freight, decrease in switching and flagging difficulties, and the use of longer trains and fewer stops, were true, the changes had existed for such a long time as to conclusively negate the railroads' ability to show either an emergency or irreparable injury. The trial court abused its discretion in granting the temporary injunction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and decree, vacated the temporary injunction, and remanded the cause with directions to the trial court to deny the railroads the relief sought.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relator malpractice claimant, through the State, filed for an alternative writ of mandate and prohibition against respondents, a circuit court and its judge, challenging the dismissal of the suit by the claimant as a plaintiff for malpractice. After dismissal, the claimant filed a motion to reinstate, which was overruled, followed by a motion to reconsider opposed by a motion to strike by the defendants in the underlying action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The claimant filed the underlying suit based on malpractice involving the claimant's son. Well over a year passed after service. The circuit court then struck the case from the docket. The claimant then filed his motions seeking to have the suit reestablished. The claimant argued that the judge acted outside of his jurisdiction and dismissed the case pursuant to an unconstitutional local rule, St. Joseph County, Ind., Cir. Ct. R. IX. On appeal, the court favored the claimant. Dismissals had to be made pursuant to 1961 Ind. Acts ch. 224, &sect; 1, p. 535, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2-901 (Cum. Supp. 1964) or when there was a total lack of jurisdiction. A court had no inherent power to establish rules affected substantive rights and dismissing a suit for other reasons than those specifically in the statute or when there was a lack of jurisdiction. Because there was jurisdiction, the statute had to be followed. Further, an excusable neglect law did not apply. While not specifically declaring the local rule invalid, the court did find that it conflicted with the statute and failed to protect the rights of litigants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court granted the writ. The circuit court and its judge were ordered to vacate the order of dismissal, reverse and vacate the overruling of the motion to reinstate, and reverse and vacate a second order overruling the motion to reinstate. They were also ordered to reinstate the cause. The circuit court and its judge were prohibited from any further attempts to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant State, on the relation of the Indiana Attorney General, challenged the decisions of the Porter Circuit Court (Indiana), which granted the demurrers by appellee justices of the peace to the complaints by the State that the justices were unlawfully retaining fees. The justices challenged the constitutionality of 1957 Ind. Acts. ch. 322, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5-130 (Supp. 1965). The two actions were consolidated for appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The statute set forth the rules regarding the retention of fees of justices of the peace based on the population of a township. The justices argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated the rule against local or special laws because it created separate standards of compensation based on townships with less than 20,000 residents and depending on the number of justices in the township. The court on appeal held that the statute was not unconstitutional. However, the statute was applied in an unconstitutional manner. That was based on the fact that townships that had more than two justices would not have their income limited until the end of their terms of offices while justices in townships with two or less, as in the case at bar, would be immediately limited. Thus, justices elected at the same time in townships of the same size were treated differently. However, once the date in the statute was met, all justices were treated equally. The different standards thus became moot after that date, and the statute was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Further, he failed to object and preserve certain errors, including one that excluded the public generally from the courtroom and a challenge to the convicting statute as unconstitutional. Essentially, defendant was unhappy for losing rather than presenting viable issues. Defendant hired his own counsel at trial, and defendant was attempting to second-guess trial strategy. Defendant also failed to preserve the speedy trial issue. On the merits, an 11-month delay was not done to prejudice defendant. Defendant failed to file an alibi defense at trial.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that failure to resort to the remedy provided by statute, and the attempted resort to the extraordinary remedy of injunction in lieu of the direct appeal provided by the Act, constituted a collateral attack on the actions of the redevelopment commission that could have been maintained only in the event that all other avenues of relief were forever closed or the commission had no jurisdiction in the first instance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State, on behalf of relator property owners, petitioned for a writ of mandate to compel respondents, a circuit court and a circuit court judge, to permit the property owners to inspect books and records necessary to the preparation of their cause of action against defendants, a city and a city redevelopment commission, to prohibit a proposed renewal area.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The commission approved an urban renewal project, which would result in the demolition of certain property. The property owners held real estate in the designated area and brought an action to prohibit the project. The property owners claimed that the property was not a menace, making the project inappropriate. The property owners petitioned the judge for discovery of the commission's books and records, and the judge ordered the discovery. However, when the commission and the city answered and objected, the trial judge overruled the order. The court held that 1965 Ind. Acts 140, &sect; 1 amended Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 2-1644 (1946) to make it mandatory that a judge allow the discovery of books and other papers that were not privileged. Because the discovery was not discretionary, the court found that it was error for the trial judge to refuse to order the city and the commission to hand over the commission's books. The court determined that the judge was prohibited from proceeding on the matter until such discovery took place.</SPAN></P>

Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 12, 13. Specifically, he alleged that because he was not given an opportunity to examine the report of court-appointed doctors or interrogate them, he was unprepared to rebut their testimony that he was legally sane. Defendant also alleged that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that criminal intent was willful intentional conduct to commit an act prohibited and made punishable by the Indiana Legislature. Affirming, the court held that defendant's claim of surprise could have been based on the testimony of only one doctor. However, since there was no inconsistency in the testimony of that doctor and that of defendant's doctors, defendant could not have been surprised by the doctor's testimony. Also, the court held that the proposed jury instruction was properly refused because it misstated the law and would have been confusing to the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants, a city court and a city court judge, appealed from a judgment of the Lake Circuit Court (Indiana), which mandated that they grant appellee individual a change of venue. The individual had been charged with the violation of a city ordinance in the city court. He filed a timely motion for change of venue from the county, which motion was denied. Thereafter, he filed an action in the circuit court and obtained the order at issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The parties agreed that 1905 Ind. Acts ch. 129, &sect; 215 (Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-2401 (1946)), which originally provided for the establishment of city courts, provided that there be no change of venue therefrom except a change of venue from the judge. By 1951 Ind. Acts ch. 165, &sect; 4 (Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4-2704 (1946)), the legislature authorized a change of venue from any city court to the circuit or superior court of an adjoining county. The circuit court rested its judgment on the authority of this statute. Appellants contended the judgment was contrary to law because the legislature in 1961 reenacted 1905 Ind. Acts ch. 129, &sect; 215 which prohibited changes of venue from the city court, thereby repealing by implication the 1951 amendment. The court agreed. As a general rule, the mere reenactment of a general law did not repeal a law enacted in the interim that dealt solely with a specific aspect of a general law. However, the 1951 act was not a special law. The court found that the 1961 act expressly covered the subject of changes of venue from all city courts. Thus by implication it repealed the 1951 amendment and the individual was not entitled to a change of venue to another county.</SPAN></P>

Several association members were arrested under the ordinance, which was later repealed.

The court denied the petition, holding that if, during the progress of a prosecution, the ordinance on which it was based was repealed, the prosecution had to fail, unless the repealing ordinance contained express provisions whereby all pending prosecutions were saved from its operation. The proceedings referred to by the association would have been be terminated by the city's own repealing ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The adopted child was adopted by his aunt and uncle while he was a minor. The adopted child inherited property from them as their adopted child. Subsequently, the adopted child's natural brother died, and he filed a petition to determine heirship. The trial court entered judgment for the administrator, holding that the adopted child could not inherit from his natural brother. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court ruled that, under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6-208(a) (1964), a child adopted as a minor was to be treated as if he were the natural child of his adopting parents and was to cease being treated as the child of his natural parents. The court ruled that the Indiana Probate Act did not violate the privileges and immunities clauses of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23 or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court stated that to treat the adopted child as his natural brother's sibling would be to treat him as the child of his natural parents in violation of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State appealed a decision and an order by the Monroe Circuit Court (Indiana), which sustained defendants' motion to quash after defendants were indicted by a grand jury for the alleged violation of &sect; 5 of the Indiana Anti-Communism Statute, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-5205 (Repl. 1956).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants filed a motion to quash the indictment, based on the theory that &sect; 10-5205 was invalid, primarily on the grounds that &sect; 10-5205 had been superseded by federal legislation, namely, the Smith Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 670, as amended in 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2385, and that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-5205 (Repl. 1956) violated defendants' freedom of speech and assembly. The court concluded that the United States Supreme Court's did not hold that the doctrine of preemption was applicable to Indiana's attempt to protect itself against subversive activities directed towards the violent overthrow of the state government. This was also the conclusion of most law writers on the subject. The court found that the &quot;clear and present&quot; doctrine had no place as a test of constitutionality. The most that could be said for the &quot;idea&quot; was that it was a principle applicable to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction under the Subversive Acts. The court held that &sect; 10-5205 was not defective because it failed to specifically state the prohibited act required to be done with guilty knowledge and intent. Such condition was to be inferred and it was thus not vague and uncertain in that respect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed the judgment and the order of the trial court sustaining the motion to quash the indictment and discharging defendants.

The court held that in order for any provision of a repealed act to be adopted by reference, a clear legislative intent to do so was required. The court ruled that 1945 Ind. Acts 304, &sect; 64, amended by 1955 Ind. Acts 273, &sect; 10, was repealed by 1961 Ind. Acts 345, &sect; 11 because &sect; 11 set a contrary schedule of taxes and registration fees for all motor vehicles and it contained no provision for passenger motor vehicles. The court determined that there was no clear legislative intent to adopt by reference the former schedule for passenger motor vehicles. Therefore, the court held that appellees had no statutory authority to impose the tax and registration fee upon passenger motor vehicles pursuant to &sect; 11.

Both affiants alleged only &quot;personal relations&quot; of others with the mother and the court did not know what that meant. The court stated that an affidavit alleging newly discovered evidence was required to set forth specifically the exact testimony or evidence that would be elicited at a new hearing from the witness or witnesses in question and should not have stated the same ambiguously or in a manner requiring inferences to be drawn from it to give it probative force. The court held that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-638 (1946) specifically stated that the trial court could admit those persons directly interested in the case. The court stated that it was difficult to imagine a person more directly interested in the case than the child for whose benefit the action for care, support, and maintenance was brought.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Claiming that appellants would make use of public funds, facilities, and services to divide the schools, appellees alleged that they would suffer irreparable damage and harm thereby in that they would be deprived of their property without due process of law. In conformance with appellees' request, the trial court on its own motion restrained appellants or anyone or anything else from in any way affecting the proposed plan until a special judge could be appointed. However, within the same order, the trial court refused to rule on appellees' application for a restraining order and disqualified himself due to his strong opinions on the subject. Subsequently, while awaiting a change of venue, appellants recognized a certification as to the proposed new school creation, adopted a motion to publish it, and authorized their attorney to publish it. These actions, appellees contended, warranted punishment for contempt of court. Ruling otherwise, the court held that the trial court's order was utterly void and a nullity for a lack of jurisdiction because no reason was provided for enjoining the provisions of the School Reorganization Act, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28-6101 et seq.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that there was no unlawful delegation of legislative power with reference to the administration of the school systems. The legislature had the discretion to determine how to organize and administrate the district. The fact that the plan was subject to the vote of the residents involved also did not render the Act unconstitutional. The court held that the Act was not an ex post facto law impairing the taxpayers' contractual rights by forcing upon them the contractual obligations previously executed by the other townships because the taxpayers were not parties to the contract and had no contractual interest therein.</SPAN></P>

The statutes expanded the area of operations of the park districts to all the territory within the county, so it merely extended the boundaries of the city's Park District, and the power to levy taxes was continued in the city council, acting as an administrative agency.</SPAN></P>

The trial court assumed jurisdiction and without notice, issued a temporary restraining order against the commission. On the commission's verified petition for a writ of prohibition, the state supreme court concluded that, by reason of the express provisions of Ind. Stat.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the opponents' complaint was facially deficient because it failed to name two of the original petitioners in support of the levee in its complaint as required by Ind. Stat.

The court also noted that the Act provided for a 30-day period in which an appeal from an order approving and confirming of a levee and assessments for it and, thus, the opponents' action was untimely. Moreover, although the provision in Ind. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city commenced eminent domain proceedings against the landowner, condemning a portion of its property for the purpose of widening an intersection. The landowner contested the condemnation and a hearing was held before the Board of Public Works. It confirmed the city's resolution and ordered a primary assessment roll be prepared, awarding damages to the landowner and the tenant. Rather than appeal, the landowner and tenant filed a petition for supplemental proceedings to set aside the final assessment roll and reopen the damages award. The Board reconfirmed the damages awards. The landowner and tenant filed a complaint for injunctive relief against the taking of the property. The trial court granted the temporary injunction and the city appealed, asserting that the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the matter. The court held that the provisions of Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-2117 (1963) setting forth the proceedings for a review of the Board's decision were unconstitutional because &sect; 48-2117 precluded the landowner and the tenant from appealing the Board's decision in the supplemental proceeding. Appellees were entitled to appeal the Board's decision.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs challenged the constitutionality of the School Corporation Reorganization Act of 1959, Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 28-6101 et seq. (Cum. Supp. 1962). Plaintiffs' motion for a new trial was denied.</SPAN></P>

Two of the three corporations were approved, and the trial court appointed their boards of trustees. Plaintiffs then filed suit. On appeal, the court ruled, inter alia, that: (1) based upon prior precedent, plaintiffs' claim that the Act was unconstitutional was meritless; (2) plaintiffs waived any error arising from the trial court's denial of their motion for special findings of fact and conclusions of law because the motion was not made at the commencement of trial; (3) the procedures followed were pursuant to the provisions of the Act, were constitutional, and the trial court's decision was sustained by sufficient evidence; (4) plaintiffs were not prejudiced by the admission of certain exhibits; and (5) the state's general election laws, Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 29-5211 (1949), was applicable to the Act, and thus a canvassers sheet disclosing the results of the referendum was properly prepared and was properly admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was charged with two counts of assault and battery with intent to gratify his sexual desires. The charges arose from a single incident involving a female child. On appeal from defendant's conviction, the court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred by not sustaining his motion to dismiss on the ground that more than three terms of the trial court had elapsed without trial, in violation of Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-1403 (1956). The delay was caused by mandamus proceedings instituted by the State after its motion for change of judge was denied. Although the trial judge was named as respondent in the State's petition, defendant's attorneys represented the judge in the proceedings. Therefore, defendant could not deny that the delay was chargeable to him under &sect; 9-1403. The court also rejected defendant's contention that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-403 violated the &quot;plain wording&quot; requirement of Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 20.

The taxpayers filed the action, alleging that they were aggrieved by the Board of Commissioners' allowance of the claim. A trial was held and their motion for a new trial was overruled.

After the filing of the petition, a special judge was named. The voters filed a supplemental petition noting that the special judge only had 10 days to try the case and that, if he failed to do so, they would be prejudiced in the election. The court issued a temporary mandatory injunction, holding that the voters' voting rights could not be denied by any board created by the legislature, or through direct legislative enactment except as the Indiana Constitution expressly provided. There were no provisions within the Indiana Constitution that expressly authorized this limitation upon the right of vote as guaranteed in Ind. Const. art. 2, &sect; 2. If Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 29-3503 were construed as purporting to grant the right to vote to persons in territory annexed prior to September 1 and denying the same right to persons living in areas annexed subsequent to September 1, it would be subject to the constitutional prohibition against class legislation.</SPAN></P>

The court sustained the motion for intervention of State officers and residents of an annexed township area. A temporary alternative writ was issued on the official's petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city council passed Ordinance No. 2345, which annexed a township. The residents filed a challenge to the ordinance with a superior court, which was dismissed because the residents' petition lacked the requisite number of signatures. The dismissal was affirmed on appeal. The residents filed an action for declaratory relief with the circuit court and later amended their action with a petition for an injunction that declared Ordinance No. 2345 unconstitutional. The circuit granted the injunction without notice to the city, its council, or the official. The official filed his petition with the court for a writ of mandamus that overturned the circuit court's order. The official asserted that an extreme emergency existed because the order denied 8,000 township residents their right to vote in a general election. The court rejected the residents' assertion that township farmland was improperly annexed for tax purposes. Ordinance No. 2345 was presumed valid. The circuit court's order was void for lack of jurisdiction because the residents had failed to serve the State Attorney General with a copy of the proceedings as required by 1927 Ind. Acts ch. 81, &sect; 11.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the exemption of certain classes from the act was not discriminatory and was reasonable. The court also held that the act was susceptible to both an intelligible and reasonable construction, so it was not unconstitutionally vague.

The Board had found that the optometrist guilty of unprofessional conduct pursuant to Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 63-1010 (1961) and Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 63-1018a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">An optometrist resided in Porter County but procured a license to practice in Lake County. He practiced ices in a room having the same outside door entrance, reception room, and receptionist, as an optical company, which carried cut-rate price advertising prohibited by Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 63-1018a(e). The Board found the optometrist guilty of unprofessional conduct by knowingly practicing in a county, where he had no license and procuring a license in a county, where he did not reside, by operating a business on the same premises as the optical company, which was not licensed in such county, and by indirectly receiving financial benefits from the company's prohibited advertising. The optometrist sought review of the Board's decision suspending his license. On review, the court held that: (1) Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 63-1010 (1961), which restricted an optometrist's practice to a single county, was unconstitutional; and (2) Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 63-1018a, which defined &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot; as any other acts that the Board might find unprofessional would be deemed unprofessional conduct, was an abrogation of legislative authority, if relied upon by the board, and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant taxpayers brought an action for an injunction to enjoin the construction and establishment of an off-street parking program. The Stueben Circuit Court (Indiana) entered a judgment denying the injunction. The taxpayers then filed a motion for a new trial, a number of the specified items being improperly worded.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">On appeal, the court felt there was a valid basis for sustaining the motion to dismiss, but it determined the case on the merits. The court held that Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 21 had no application in the instant case since it applied only to acts which purported to amend other acts, and 1959 Ind. Acts ch. 129, being Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-8482, the statute authorizing the off-street parking project, did not purport to amend any act. There was nothing unconstitutional in the Act of 1959 incorporating by reference 1955 Ind. Acts ch. 190, being Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-8470 et seq. There was no constitutional barrier to the application of the Act of 1959 in the case. Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 48-1247 and 10-3713, prohibiting common councilmen from being interested in contracts with the city, were not applicable under the facts of the case. The action of the city board of public works approving the off-street parking project was not invalid although a remonstrance by 228 persons was filed. The city was not required to have appropriated money for the return of donations made to be used to pay for the project in the event there was not a compliance with the conditions of the donations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In seeking the injunction, the taxpayer claimed that the proposed amount of the bonds, together with all other outstanding indebtedness of the townships, would have exceeded the two percent debt limit in both townships in violation of Ind. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1. The trial court denied the injunction, and the taxpayer appealed, claiming that the trial court's decision was contrary to law. The court held that the two percent debt limitation was to be based upon the assessed value of the property, which was one-third of the true cash value, and thus, the proposed bond issue, when added to the present indebtedness of the townships, would have exceeded two percent of the assessed value of the taxable property in both townships. The court found that under the Indiana Constitution, the value for the purpose of determining the two percent debt limitation was to be the true or actual value of the property as ascertained or determined by the last assessment for state and county taxes. The court concluded that 1961 Ind. Acts 122, &sect; 2 attempted to effect an increase in the bond limitation in contravention of the limit fixed by Ind. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1 and was, therefore, invalid and void.</SPAN></P>

A trial resulted in the jury being unable to agree on a unanimous verdict. The cause was set for retrial in the trial court. The cab company filed another motion for change of venue, alleging that there was widespread publicity concerning the case in the county where trial was to be held. The trial court overruled the motion. The cab company filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel respondents to grant a change of venue and for a temporary writ of prohibition directing respondents to refrain from exercising further jurisdiction in the underlying cause until further order of the court. The cab company contended that the underlying case was subject to a change of venue by virtue of analogy to the situation where a case was reversed by an appellate tribunal. The court held that the cab company's analogy was inappropriate because no provision was made either by statute or the court's rules for a second change of venue and because no verdict or decision adverse to the cab company had been reached.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State challenged a judgment from the Allen Circuit Court (Indiana), which sustained defendants' motion to quash an indictment filed against it for alleged violation of the Indiana Anti-Gambling Law, Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The state brought 13 illegal gambling indictments against defendants. The indictments were based on the operation of pinball machines in publicly available places. The operation of the machines was said to involve the chance to win more than just the right to replay. Defendants filed amended motions to quash, which alleged that the Indiana Anti-Gambling Law, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 10-2329 to 10-2336 (1956), as amended by Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-2330 (1961), was unconstitutional because it deprived them of equal protection under the law because of the distinction in Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-2330 (1961) between public and private venues. The trial court granted the motions. On appeal, the court set the judgment aside and instructed the trial court to overrule the motions. The court noted that it had already held that the challenged anti-gambling law was constitutional in a couple of recent cases. The public versus private classification was a reasonable distinction between a social past time and professional gambling that was inherent in the subject matter of the law.</SPAN></P>

Appellant appeared by counsel and objected to the hearing, but the objection was overruled. After the hearing, the trial court set aside and vacated the default judgment. On appeal, the court found that the default judgment had been vacated and set aside within the term in which it was entered. The record failed to show that appellant was served with any notice of the motion to vacate and set aside the judgment. However, because appellant had appeared and opposed the motion without making any objection to the failure to receive service of the motion, such error was deemed to have been waived.

Acts 325.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The owners sought a declaration that 1961 Ind. Acts 325, which provided that household goods were to be assessed at five percent of the assessed valuation of the improvements on the real estate in which the household goods were kept, was unconstitutional. They also sought to enjoin enforcement of the Act by the taxing authorities. The trial court found that the Act was unconstitutional and enjoined its enforcement. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. Ind. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1 provided that citizens had a fundamental right to the &quot;just&quot; assessment of their property for tax purposes. While there might be a relationship between the value of real property and the contents of a residence, it was too speculative to be the basis for a &quot;just&quot; valuation. Furthermore, the fact that an aggrieved taxpayer could obtain an on-site valuation of the household goods was not sufficient to make the Act constitutional. The court noted that under-assessed taxpayers were in a more favorable position than other taxpayers and there was no provision to equalize an under-assessment that resulted from the statutory formula.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In 1951 a convention was called to nominate three trustees of the town. The nominees assumed office, although no election was held in November. The nominees and their successors continuously held themselves out as officers of the town although no conventions were held in 1955 or 1959. The town brought suit to condemn real estate and right of way for a sewage treatment plant and a sanitary sewer. The landowners filed objections to the proceedings, stating that the town's trustees were not duly elected. The trial court held in favor of the landowners and overruled the town's motion for a new trial. The town contended that the trial court erred in permitting a collateral attack on the town's condemnation suit. The court held that: (1) the nominees of the 1951 convention held sufficient color of title to the offices they assumed to constitute them de facto officers of the town; (2) where the provisions of Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-118 (1950 Repl.) were complied with when vacancies occurred by resignation, the present officers of the town constituted de facto officers thereof; and (3) where the town officers were de facto officers, the town had authority to maintain the condemnation action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The county auditor certified the real estate as delinquent for non-payment of taxes. Notice was sent to the landowners, and it was published in a newspaper of general circulation. The purchaser bought the property at a public sale, and he received a deed after the redemption period had expired. Later, the landowners attempted to tender payment to the purchaser. After payment was rejected, the landowners deposited the payment in the clerk's office. On review, the court noted that when a conclusive presumption existed, the legislature could not constitutionally declare a tax deed conclusive evidence of a valid sale. Therefore, the court found that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 64-2203 (1951) could not be applied because it stated that a deed to land was conclusive evidence that the sale met the legal requirements. The court held that the sale had several irregularities. The court reasoned that the property was sold for taxes that were not yet delinquent for a period of 15 months, as required by &sect; 64-2203. In affirmance, the court concluded that the function of determining whether mistake, error, or fraud had produced an instrument that appeared correct on its face, was a judicial act.</SPAN></P>

On review, the court found that there was nothing in the record showing that the circuit court did not determine the sufficiency of the remonstrance. The court stated that, in the absence of such a showing, it was presumed that the circuit court complied with Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-702 (1960). The court held that it was improper for the property owners to serve notice upon the council. The court determined that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2-804(a) did not state who were the proper officers to receive service in an annexation proceeding. Therefore, the court reasoned that the term &quot;proper officers&quot; meant those officers designated in the general statute providing for the service of process against corporations. The court further held that the circuit court did not lose jurisdiction when it failed to hold a hearing on the remonstrance because the statute was not mandatory.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the General Assembly had broad authority to prescribe the method for the consolidation of schools.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The board denied the petition of the church to build a church, school, and related facilities on its land because the project would have had depreciated the value of the residential property bordering it.

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court decision that the board erroneously denied the church's petition. The court held that depreciation of adjacent homes was not a constitutionally valid reason for excluding the proposed church and its facilities. The court held that the state and federal constitutions provided for freedom of worship and encouragement of education and board did not have the authority to exclude churches or schools in residence districts. The court noted that it was never intended that zoning laws should be used for the purpose of creating special privileges or private rights in property from creating an exclusive community.</SPAN></P>

While strict liability penal statutes were constitutional in certain areas, they were not when questions of freedom of speech and of the press were at issue. Section 10-2803 violated the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 9 under a balancing test between the right of the state to exercise its police powers to prevent the sale of obscenity and free speech and expression. Since the statute imposed strict liability, it acted as a form of self-censorship of written materials. The invalid portion of the statute made the entire statute void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relator was a minor who was charged, tried, and convicted of robbery. The relator's request for a transcript and bill of exceptions at public expense was denied, and he filed a petition for a writ of mandate to compel the trial court to grant his request. The petition was denied. Relator brought an original proceeding in the court for a writ of mandate, and an alternative writ issued. On consideration, the court made its writ permanent. The court noted that Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 4-3511 required that an accused be provided with a transcript at public expense if he lacked the means to pay for it. The court noted that parents were legally obligated to provide necessaries for their children, which included criminal defense expenses. The court ruled that a dependent child whose parents were able to pay for his necessary legal expenses was not considered to be a pauper under &sect; 4-3511. The court also ruled that relator's constitutional right to a trial record for an appeal required more than a cursory inquiry into his ability to pay. Because relator's affidavits were contradicted solely by extraneous information, the court remanded the case to allow further evidence to be taken.</SPAN></P>

Upon review, the court rejected the contention that the mother-son relationship made defendant immune from prosecution because neither the accessory after the fact statute nor the concealing a felon statute was applicable. The court also held that there was no evidence that the son had coerced the mother. Moreover, notwithstanding that a thief's confessions were inadmissible against one receiving stolen property, the court held that statements made by the son in the presence of defendant, his mother, were admissible. The court also held that when a confession gave information as to where stolen property could be found, the property's discovery was admissible even if the confession was not. Furthermore, the court held that because defendant was not charged as an accessory, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-1603, which required the accomplice's consent to testify, was inapplicable. Finally, the court refused to find an unconstitutional search because there was no actual search of defendant's house and because defendant lacked standing to challenge the search of her son's house.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer contended that the creation of separate public corporations for the establishment of libraries was an attempt to evade the constitutional debt limitation in violation of Ind. Const. art. 13, &sect; 1. The court rejected this contention, holding that the creation of library districts in Indiana as public corporations for library purposes, separate and distinct from the civil or municipal corporations, was not prohibited by the Indiana Constitution and was a valid exercise of legislative power. The court rejected the taxpayer's contention that the Library Law of 1947, was invalid for the reasoned that it deprived the people of the library district of their right of local self-government. The taxpayer contended that the Act provided for the appointment instead of the election of members of the Library Board. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that while the legislature has no right or power to appoint municipal officers, it did have to power to enact laws prescribing the manner of selection and the duties of such officers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellant, Edwin McClure, upon the death of the incumbent in April, 1959, was appointed by the Governor to the office of the Clerk of the Marion Circuit Court.  Jack O'Brien and others, appellees, brought this action under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act to determine the right and duties of the Marion County Election Board as they relate to the election of a Clerk of the Marion Circuit Court, at the general election to be held on November 8, 1960.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellants asserted that the question of whether or not a Clerk of the Marion Circuit Court should have been elected at the general election to have been held in November was fully and completely answered by the provisions of Ind.

Section 49-2702 did not under the factual situation presented, violate any of the provisions of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 1. The Legislature had complied fully with the mandate of Ind. Const. art. 6, &sect; 9 by prescribing by law for the filling of vacancies in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court. For those reasons the provisions of that section were not violated by Ind. Code &sect; 49-2702. The court concluded that &sect; 49-2702 was a valid enactment of the Legislature, that it was now in full force and effect and governed the term for which the Governor was appointed to fill the vacancy that then existed in the office of the Clerk of the Marion Circuit Court, and that no vacancy then existed in such office.</SPAN></P>

A city and county created the levee district pursuant to the act. The taxpayer filed a declaratory judgment action against appellants challenging the constitutionality of the act.

The court held that a law that contained a classification based upon population was not an unconstitutional special or local law so long as there was some relationship between the classification and the objective of the law. The court determined that the method of distributing and levying assessments for local improvements was a matter of legislative discretion.

Upon review, the court held that the Act was a lawful exercise of the police power because gambling prevention was related to the public morals, safety, and welfare. The court also held that the phrase &quot;in any place accessible to the public&quot; did not create an unconstitutional classification because there was a reason for the classification and because the Act treated all publicly maintained machines alike. In so holding, the court noted that in order to profit from the machines, the machines had to be maintained in a public place. Moreover, in rejecting the contention that that the Act only applied to the &quot;professional gambler,&quot; the court held that the Act applied to persons whose conduct brought them within the Act, regardless of whether they were, or were not, professional gamblers.

Despite the taxpayer's contention that due to the population limitation in the Act, the Act was a local and special law, the court found that the Act should not be regarded as a local or special act simply because at the time of its enactment it may have only applied to one city. The court found that the act was not unconstitutional for failure to comply with Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 19, in that two matters contained in the Act were not covered by the title.

The railroad filed a motion for a new trial. Ninety four days after the filing of the new trial motion, relator filed a motion to withdraw the submission from the judge for the reason that under Ind. Sup. Ct. R. 1-13 the judge should not have held the same under advisement for longer than 90 days. The judge overruled relator's motion to withdraw the submission and set the motion for a new trial. That ruling by the circuit court was deemed to have been an appealable final judgment. However, relator did not come into the court with his original action until more than a month after the appealable judgment was rendered. The court held that a writ of mandate and prohibition was never intended to be a substitute for the remedy of appeal.

The trial court granted the mandatory injunction requested. In a consolidated appeal, the court upheld the constitutionality of the brucellosis statute that was enacted by the State under its police power. However, in reviewing the record, the court noted that there was no record or minutes of the board of county commissioners in which they authorized the contract with the board to carry out the eradication program in the county as the statute required. Because there was no record of any action by the board of county commissioners upon which the statute authorized the Indiana Livestock Sanitary Board to act in the county, the court reversed, concluding that the trial court was without sufficient facts to issue the mandatory injunction empowering the state board to carry out its program in opposition to the cattle owners' objections.</SPAN></P>

The State filed an action against the dental technician to prohibit him practicing dentistry. The trial court issued an injunction against the dental technician and he sought review. The court affirmed. The court held that dentistry was a profession directly related to the public health and that the exercise of the State's police power for the control of its practice was a matter that rested with the legislature. As such, the court said, the State's regulation of the profession could not have been annulled by a court unless it contravened a provision of the Constitution. The court responded to the dental technician's argument that the licensing statute violated the privileges and immunities clauses of both the state and federal constitutions by pointing out that the dental technician did not have a vested right to practice dentistry.

Relator took an oath of office and submitted his bond to the Board of County Commissioners of Marion County for approval. Two members of the Commission refused the bond, contending that they had the power to make the appointment rather than the Governor. Thereafter, the Marion Circuit Court entered an order mandating the Commissioners to accept the bond and approve relator. The two commissioners filed an action in quo warranto in the Marion Superior Court and respondent issued an order restraining relator from entering the office of clerk. The court held that a first court to assume jurisdiction had jurisdiction as against another court of equal and coordinate power. The court also concluded that the Governor had the authority to fill a vacancy in the office of clerk of the circuit court, under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 49-404 (1951). The clerk of a circuit court was a circuit officer, not a county clerk. The Commissioners only had authority to fill vacancies in &quot;county or township offices,&quot; pursuant to the Ind. Const. art. VI, &sect; 9.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The court affirmed his conviction. Defendant asserted that he was wrongfully deprived of his right to be tried before a judge without a jury. Under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, defendants were entitled to a jury trial. There was no correlative right to a bench trial. Under 1905 Ind. Acts ch. 169, &sect; 258, p. 584, Ind. Code &sect; 9-1803 (1956) the right to a jury trial could only be waived by the consent of both parties. Defendant also objected to the admission of evidence suggesting he failed to take a drunkometer test. Usually, evidence suggesting an accused freely and voluntarily consented to a drunkenness test was admissible. Conversely, the results of compulsory blood tests were not usually admissible evidence. Evidence suggesting an accused failed to take a test was admissible because it involved no compulsion. The constitutional safeguard against self incrimination enacted by Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 was inapplicable to this dispute because no testimonial compulsion was involved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">In two eminent domain cases consolidated for hearing, appellant landowners challenged an order of the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) granting an easement across their property to appellee common carrier for the right of way for an oil pipeline. They argued that neither the condemnation statute nor the Indiana General Corporation Act allowed the common carrier, which was a foreign business, to condemn Indiana real estate for the pipeline.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The common carrier operated under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The right of a foreign corporation to exercise the power of eminent domain could only exist by an affirmative grant of statutory power. The Eminent Domain Act of the State of Indiana, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-1713 (1946) provided that an Indiana corporation could exercise eminent domain to carry out certain public purposes. The General Corporation Act of 1929, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 25-302 (1948), had an equalizing clause that placed foreign corporations on the same basis as Indiana corporations. A foreign corporation authorized to do business in Indiana could exercise the power of eminent domain when domestic corporations were given the privilege. The business must exercise the power of eminent domain for a public use or utility without discrimination. Other Indiana common carriers were authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain. It was immaterial that the carrier leased portions of their electrical output to other public utilities. Likewise, the common carrier from outside Indiana was authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant alleged landowner challenged an order of the Pulaski Circuit Court (Indiana) granting judgment to appellee alleged landowners in their action to quiet title in a certain piece of property and to set aside a tax deed. Appellant claimed title to the property as a successor in interest of the original tax sale purchaser. She argued that the action was barred by a one-year limitations period under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 64-2203a and 64-2212.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellees contended that the general 15-year statute of limitations, under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2-603, applied. The court disagreed and reversed. The 1941 amendment encompassed in Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 64-2212 revised the earlier act. This sale and deed were executed under the 1941 act and the one-year statute of limitations applied. The one-year statute was not unconstitutional.&nbsp;Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 21 required that the wording of an amended section be set out in full. It did not restrict direct or implied amendments or repeals when the extra section was set out in full text. The purpose was to prevent surprise or fraud by a title that did not apprise the public of the subject-matter of the proposed law. Although Ind. Stat. Ann. 64-2212 did not designate in its body any specific section that it amended and sections in the amendment did not cover the same subject matter as the original act, the subject matter of the period of limitations did fall within the purview of the act to be amended and was a valid amendment. An amendatory act could repeal or modify another statute by implication to the extent that it was repugnant to the limited area it covered.</SPAN></P>

The legislature subsequently passed the Act, which contained a curative provision that validated districts established under the prior law. After the circuit court reiterated its establishment of the district, the taxpayer brought an action alleging that the Act was unconstitutional. The circuit court granted judgment against the taxpayer. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that (1) the unconstitutionality of the prior law did not have retroactive effect because the initial circuit court judgment, entered without objection, was the law of the case and because the Act's curative provision was effective, (2) the Act was not in any respect unconstitutionally defective, but was properly enacted under the legislature's authority to create taxing districts for the purpose of funding local public improvements.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that: (1) Ind. Stat.

However, the court also held that no statute authorized a judgment against the state, and for this reason, the court reversed the judgment as to the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Board ordered the city to construct facilities to treat sanitary and domestic sewage including the city's industrial wastes.

Ann. &sect;&sect; 63-3001 to 63-3030 (1951). The city argued that its appeal was field within 15 days of the trial court's order striking its motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court found that the city's judicial review was governed by the Administrative Act. The Stream Pollution Control Board Act of 1943 (Stream Act), Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 68-517 to 68-534 (1951) did not provide for judicial review of the Board's orders, which was repugnant to the Administrative Act. Section 28 of the Administrative Act, Ind. Stat.

There was no basis for the city's motion for a new trial under the Administrative Act, and the motion was correctly stricken out. Because the city improperly filed a motion for a new trial, its notice of appeal was not timely filed within 15 days of the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed. The court found nothing in Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54-601(b) (1951) that prohibited the Commission from granting a certificate. In addition, the court found that when the telephone company sought to obtain a certificate of territorial authority under &sect; 54-601(b), it estopped itself from thereafter claiming in the same proceeding that the section was unconstitutional. As the telephone company asserted the findings of the Commission were insufficient to sustain the order. Where the telephone company offered uncontroverted and unimpeached testimony, the Commission was not at liberty to disregard such evidence and make no special findings upon it. The findings were too general to permit an appellate court as a court of review to intelligently judge whether the action was based upon substantial evidence. The findings were so defective that the order based thereon was void.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellee, Clarke Auto Co., Inc. brought this action in behalf of itself and all other automobile dealers similarly situated, to enjoin appellants from enforcing &sect; 10-4305, Burns' 1957 Supp., which prohibited automobile dealers from buying or selling automobiles at retail on Sunday.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant state prosecuting attorney challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Marion County (Indiana), which granted plaintiff automobile dealer an injunction that enjoined the State of Indiana from enforcing Ind. Code &sect; 4305 (1957 Supp.), a statute which prohibited automobile dealers from buying or selling automobiles at retail on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The automobile dealer, on behalf of himself and all other automobile dealers similarly situated, sought to enjoin the enforcement of Ind. Code &sect; 10-4305 (1957 Supp.). That statute subjected automobile dealers that engaged in the business of buying, selling, and/or exchanging motor vehicles at retail on Sunday to fines and/or imprisonment greater than those imposed upon dealers and other businesses that were made unlawful by the general Sunday closing law, Ind. Code &sect; 10-4301 (1956 Repl.). The trial court granted the injunction on the ground that the classification of the act, which imposed a greater penalty on the class, was &quot;wholly arbitrary and unreasonable,&quot; and therefore in violation of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23, and Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect;&sect; 22, 23. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the state had the authority under its police power to provide a day for man's recurring need for rest and relaxation. Because there were characteristics in the several businesses that distinguished them from the retail sales of automobiles, the automobile car dealer did not overcome the presumption in favor of the statute's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court vacated the temporary injunction issued by the trial court that enjoined the state from enforcing a statute that prohibited car dealers from buying or selling automobiles at retail on Sunday.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer engaged in producing, refining, transporting, and selling gasoline, lubricating oils, and petroleum products. The taxpayer paid federal excise taxes on gasoline and lubricating oils. Most of the taxpayer's sales were made wholesale to service or filling stations. Its invoices to its customers included the amount of federal excise tax in the sales price. The division collected gross income taxes from the taxpayers, asserting that the amounts of federal excise taxes charged and received were gross receipts to the taxpayer. The taxpayer filed an action against the division to recover the gross income taxes paid. The trial court found in favor of the division. The taxpayer appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the assessment of gross income taxes was proper. The court reasoned that although the amount of federal excise tax was added as a separate charge on the invoices, no excise tax was imposed or paid by the taxpayer's customers. By adding the federal excise taxes as a separate charge, the taxpayer in effect raised the cost of the gasoline to its customers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State sought review of a judgment by the Scott Circuit Court (Indiana), which acquitted defendant on a charge of arson. The State appealed on a reserved question of law only, claiming that under the Fire Marshal's Act, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 20-808 (1950 Repl.), no search warrant was necessary, and therefore the trial court erred in sustaining the objection of defendant to the admission of certain evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">A restaurant building, owned by defendant, caught fire causing the interior to be badly burned. Upon investigation, a state trooper photographer was sent to the scene. While the photographer was taking a picture of a hole in the utility room where the fire originated, he discovered a hot plate at the bottom. Further examination revealed a cord for the hot plate, a pile of torn newspapers, and a sack soaked in fuel oil. The materials were seized as evidence. Upon the strength of the evidence, defendant was arrested and placed on trial for arson. The general question was whether the evidence so obtained was taken unlawfully in violation of defendant's constitutional rights under Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 11. The court held that under the Fire Marshal law the fire marshal and his deputies and agents had to obtain a search warrant prior to searching a person's dwelling, effects, or possessions for the purpose of obtaining evidence to be used in criminal prosecution and that basic constitutional requirement could be and was by implication incorporated as a necessary part of the responsibility and activity authorized by the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When the town was incorporated, it was zoned entirely as a dwelling house district. Prior thereto, the owner operated a grocery store on her land, which was located near a busy intersection and highway. The store's business declined and the owner tried to sell the land. For almost a year, nobody was interested in the land as either a store or a residence. The owner received an offer to buy the land for the construction of a cottage type filling station. At a hearing before the board, the residents opposed the owner's request for a variance because, they argued, a filling station would have depreciated the value of their land. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly reversed the board's decision to deny the owner's request for a variance. The court determined that the zoning ordinance restricting the owner's land to residential purposes was unreasonable because it precluded the owner's use of the property for any purpose for which it was adapted. The court ruled that the evidence sufficiently showed that, given the heavy traffic in the area, it was unreasonable to restrict the owner's land to a residential use in an effort to provide a dignified village frontage.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that although appellants' complaint was not as specific as it could have been, the allegations were sufficient to clearly imply that the gas and electric company operated in the forum county; therefore there was no jurisdictional bar. The court determined that appellants were entitled to their day in court and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the arrestee's petition for habeas corpus. The court found, inter alia, that (1) in a habeas corpus proceeding to test the validity of an arrest and detention made by virtue of a governor's extradition warrant, the arrestee could not offer evidence to prove that he was not in the demanding state at the time of the alleged offense; (2) the construction of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, which limited introduction of the evidence to the question of arrestee's identity, did not violate the U.S. Const. art. 4, &sect; 2, cl. 2; the 14th Amendment; or Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The convictions arose from an assault in which defendant aimed at one man, but shot another. First, the court disposed of defendant's claims that his assault count varied from the proof and that he had been misled in his defense, finding that they lacked merit. Next, the court addressed defendant's constitutional challenges to the Uniform Firearms Act and held that they, too, lacked merit. Thus, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court reasoned that the act fixed the general standard of fitness, character, and reputation necessary to qualify for a firearms license and provided for review by a circuit court. The court found no unlawful delegation of legislative power in the act and held that it did not violate the Due Process Clause or Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 1. Lastly, the court rejected defendant's claim that the act violated Ind. Const. art. 1. &sect;, which granted the right to bear arms. The legislature had the power, in the interest of public safety and welfare, to provide reasonable regulations for the use of firearms such as pistols, which could be readily concealed. The act did not unduly restrict the right of the people to bear arms.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relators, a county welfare board and its members, sought a writ of mandate and prohibition against respondents, a trial court and a trial court judge, to prohibit the trial court from enforcing an order for the board to make all of its records available for inspection and to compel the trial court to return all the records that had previously been impounded by the sheriff pursuant to the trial court's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court had ordered the sheriff to impound records of the board and had subsequently ordered the board to produce certain records for the trial court's inspection. The trial court overruled the board's motion to set aside the court's orders. The board filed an action, seeking a writ of mandate and prohibition against the trial court. The court granted a permanent writ of prohibition, concluding that the trial court lacked the jurisdiction and the authority to enter the orders. The power granted to trial courts under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52-1118 (1951), as part of the Indiana Public Welfare Act, did not include the right to order, sua sponte, county welfare boards to deliver their records to the courts or to impound them for the purpose of determining if there had been any misconduct, incapacity, or neglect by the members of the board, nor was such power incidental or necessary to the determination of that issue. The trial court's attempt to conduct an administrative review violated the separation of powers doctrine under Ind. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1. The trial court was not, either directly or indirectly, authorized to seize the records under 1953 Ind. Acts ch. 115.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At trial, defendant was charged with and convicted of vehicle taking and being a habitual criminal pursuant to the Habitual Criminal Act, Ind.

Then defendant filed a &quot;motion to vacate void judgment.&quot; The trial court overruled the motion. The court affirmed the trial court's order. The court first held that defendant's motion was properly treated as a petition for writ of error coram nobis because there was no procedure in the court for vacating a judgment at the end of the court's term. As a coram nobis petition, defendant failed to show why the alleged constitutional infirmities he alleged in this action were not alleged at trial or on direct appeal. Because he failed to make such a showing, he was not entitled to relief. But the court went on to note that the provision of the Habitual Criminal Act requiring being charged with the third felony and with being a habitual criminal, then requiring conviction of both, was constitutional. The Act did not impose life imprisonment for an additional crime, but for the status of being a habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated the order. On appeal, the court held that appellee had not acted with any malice when it attempted to obtain a larger amount of business for itself. The court determined the record disclosed that appellee had not obtained a monopoly or entered into any agreement that would create a monopoly. Instead, there was a free play of competition in the State, and only a small part of the business went to appellee. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court further concluded that the husband, who was the murderer, became a constructive trustee for the estate of the wife, who was the victim, in one-half of the property.

The Indiana General Assembly had authority to except fair trade price fixing by contract from the antitrust acts. The FTA was not an attempt to allow price fixing by private persons.

He refused and the attorney general then filed a verified application for appointment of a special prosecutor. The trial court dismissed the application. On appeal, the court reviewed the statutes alleged to have been violated and determined that the sewer construction contracts involved were &quot;public contracts&quot; entered into by public authorities in the exercise of a governmental power.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, the State of Indiana and others, appealed a judgment from a trial court (Indiana) in favor of plaintiff foreign construction corporation.

Stat. Ann. St., &sect;&sect; 62-1001, 62-1002, income derived from contracts performed upon lands ceded to the federal government by the State was not subject to the tax. The court held that the trial court erred in finding that such part the corporation's gross receipts in question and derived from construction work performed upon land ceded to the Federal Government were exempt from the provisions of the Indiana Gross Income Tax Act, as amended. The State acquired the right to tax private interests within the location by permission of Congress under the Buck Act, 4 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 104-110, which permitted state sales, use, and income taxes. The court also held that the State could tax when the United States divested itself of proprietary interest over the area on which the tax was sought.

The employer employed two full-time employees and six part-time employees who were working full time for other employers. The employer contended that the six part-time employees should not have been included in determining his liability under the Act. The employer filed for transfer to the court, claiming that the appellate court failed to discuss and decide the basic question raised by the employer, namely, whether the imposition of the employment security tax in this case was an abuse of the police power of the state. The court found that the Act was a proper exercise of the taxing power of the State of Indiana. The court held that although the issues presented by the employer in his petition were not discussed and decided by the appellate court, the issues were without merit.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">When the Commission denied the utility's petition for a rate increase, the utility brought an action to review the order. The trial court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction and the utility appealed, urging that the trial court had jurisdiction under &sect; 54-203. The Commission insisted that the complaint was defective in not alleging that the subject matter of the procedure had been in the trial court's county. The court disagreed, explaining that &sect; 54-203 provided for de novo review in the circuit court of the county where a utility was located or in the superior court of Marion County (Indiana). The Commission contended that &sect; 54-203 was unconstitutional to the extent that it attempted to amend a prior statute because it omitted certain sections from its title. However, this claim failed because the omitted sections had already been superceded and an act which attempted to amend a non-existent law or section was itself void. The court held that &sect; 54-203 was constitutional and was the proper procedure for obtaining a review of rulings of the Commission in rate cases. Thus, the utility's complaint seeking review had been sufficient as against the motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the taxpayers contended that the arrangement violated the equal protection provision found in Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23 because it granted a special privilege to the corporation that others did not enjoy. They also asserted that, when the lease payments were considered together, the lease violated the debt limitation imposed by Ind. Const. art. 13, &sect; 1. The court rejected the taxpayers' arguments. Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28-3227 (Cum. Supp. 1955), which allowed the trustees to sell the property to the corporation, did not extend a special privilege in violation of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23; the statute merely insured that the property would continued to be used for its intended public purpose. The lease did not give rise to an to an indebtedness for the aggregate of all the rentals for the entire term because it was truly a lease and not an installment purchase contract; no violation of Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23 was shown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The railroads contended that the act violated Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 19 which provided that every act shall embrace but one subject and matters properly connected therewith which subject shall be expressed in the title. Section 6 of the act created a special court made up of judges of each circuit court where a proposed conservancy district was located to establish districts upon appropriate petition. The purpose of that act as set forth in its title was to prevent floods, to protect cities, towns, farms and highways from inundation, to conserve water for beneficial uses, and to authorize the organization of drainage and conservancy districts, and declaring an emergency. The court held that the title to the act was not sufficiently broad to include the establishment of a new court because the title to the act was narrow in scope, limited to issues relating to flooding and conservation of water, and one reading the act would be surprised to find that an entirely new and novel court was created to administer the act. The court concluded that, pursuant to art. 4, &sect; 19, the act could not be construed to extend its operations beyond the conservation purpose expressed in the title.</SPAN></P>

The court also ruled that the circuit court's blanket order for bonds applying to transfers from the magistrates court was authorized by Ind. Stat.

The provision that property owned by a school corporation could not be sold or leased to any person or corporation other than one formed solely for the purpose of erecting a school building and leasing it to the school corporation was meant to assure the public use of the property as originally intended at the time of its purchase by the school corporation.

The court rejected that contention, holding that the state could delegate a portion of its police power to a subordinate municipality, commission or board created by the state under a long-term lease arrangement, and that the Act was constitutional. However, the court, based on the meaning of the words used in the Act, held that the municipality failed to follow the provisions outlined in the Act with respect to asking for bids for leasing the two sites. Thus, the acceptance of the bids were rendered invalid. The court ruled that terms and provisions which would assure that the off-street parking facilities would not be diverted under some private contract to the exclusion of the public generally were required, and determined that the bidding and the proposed leases were defective in failing to provide such safeguards.

The accused pled not guilty and also filed a plea of insanity. After a statutory examination, the accused filed a verified application with statements of his physicians and requested the court to hold a hearing for the purpose of declaring the accused a criminal sexual psychopathic person. The trial court contended that under the Act, although the proceedings were mandatory when requested by the prosecuting attorney, they were discretionary with the court when requested on behalf of the accused in a criminal case. The court held that the Act did not apply because the accused was not charged with a sexual offense. Also, since the Act placed no restriction on the trial court's denial of a request on behalf of the accused for a hearing, the accused could not force the trial court to grant a hearing. The trial court could take into consideration the accused's plea of insanity, which the Act excluded, in exercising its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant challenged a judgment from the Vanderburgh Circuit Court (Indiana) which, following a jury trial, convicted defendant of murder in the second degree under an indictment charging murder in the first degree. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to quash the indictment and in overruling his motion for a new trial, which alleged that the verdict was not sustained by the evidence and was contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant was a paratrooper just returned from overseas duty. He went to a dance hall and was attacked during a brawl. Defendant pulled the safety pin out of a grenade to keep the crowd back. He either dropped or threw the grenade. The grenade exploded and killed the victim. Defendant was charged with murder with a deadly weapon called a hand grenade loaded with nitroglycerin. The court found that one of the jury instructions given was fatally defective in that it left the impression that defendant might be convicted of a lesser included offense without proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also determined that the erroneous instruction was not cured by other instructions giving the correct principles involved. In addition, the court held that, pursuant to Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, defendant had a constitutional right to be prosecuted on a specific charge intended to give warning of the evidence that might be introduced against him so that he might defend against it. The court concluded that, where the prosecution falsely represented that nitroglycerin was the explosive in the grenade in order to inflame the jury, there was a variance between the proof and the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant sought review of his conviction by the Noble Circuit Court (Indiana) for second degree burglary, in violation of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 10-701 (1942), and possession of burglar tools by one previously convicted of a felony, in violation of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 10-703 (1942). Defendant assigned as error the trial court's overruling of his motion to quash, motion in arrest of judgment and his motion for new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant argued that the second degree burglary count was insufficient because it failed to allege that the grocery store where the crime was committed was a place other than a dwelling house or place of human habitation. He also challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 10-703. The State sought dismissal of the appeal because defendant's assignment of errors was filed under the name of &quot;Sam Goldstine&quot; while the judgment of conviction in the trial court was against &quot;Sam Goldstein.&quot; Affirming, the court held that the State should not have been allowed to take advantage of technical errors and that the name in the assignment of errors and the name in the judgment of conviction were phonetically identical even though the spelling was slightly different. The court noted that in a prior appeal it had held that the second degree burglary count adequately charged the crime of second degree burglary. Moreover, &sect; 10-703 was constitutional and did not unreasonably classify ex-convicts in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment or Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23 and art. 4, &sect; 20. The court found ample evidence of probative force to support the decision of the trial judge.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayer filed his action asserting that the lease was void because it violated &sect; 1 and its limitation on indebtedness. Appellees' demurrer asserted that the complaint did not state facts sufficient to show that the rentals reserved under the leases constituted indebtedness in excess of the indebtedness permitted under &sect; 1 in that the annual indebtedness did not exceed the constitutional limitations. On appeal, the court held that the demurrer was properly sustained. The entire aggregate rental over the 40-year term of the lease was not the basis for determining the amount of debt assumed by the county. The constitutional debt limitation applied to the annual rent because the future annual rent did not become debts until earned.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Appellants, William G.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant citizens sought review of a judgment of the Hendricks Circuit Court (Indiana), which held that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28-2455 et seq. (Supp. 1953), was constitutional. After the court issued its original opinion, appellees, the Guilford Township School Corporation (Indiana) and its Board Members, filed a petition for rehearing. The court granted rehearing and recalled its original opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Section 28-2455 et seq. provided that the voters of a township could elect to transfer control of the township schools from the township trustee, in whom such control had traditionally resided in Indiana, to a school corporation, under a five-member board of school trustees. In accordance with &sect; 28-2455 et seq., the Corporation was established and the Board Members were appointed. The citizens claimed that the statute was a local and special law in contravention of Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 22(10), (13), &sect; 23. Specifically, the citizens contended that the statute was invalid on the ground that it was too limited in application because it applied only to townships with an incorporated town of at least 2,000 persons. On rehearing, the court held that the statute was not unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the legislature was entitled to create a classification based on population and that the classification was constitutional because it was not arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, irrational, or artificial. The citizens failed to show that the statute constituted unreasonable discrimination against any other school corporation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellant filed a complaint contending that &sect; 11-1424 Burns' 1942 Repl. Cum.

The trial court ruled that the statute was constitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and ruled that the legislation was not a valid exercise of the legislature's police power. The court took judicial notice of the fact that a high percentage of persons of hunting age were ex-members of the armed forces and concluded that to exempt them from paying the fee for hunting and fishing licenses would have tended to deplete the funds available for protection and propagation of wildlife and thereby retarded and delayed conservation objectives. The court found that the legislative act which produced this result could not have had even a tendency to protect public health, morals, order, safety, or welfare and that the statute was in contravention of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The District sought to issue and sell certain tax bonds to provide for additions, extensions, and improvements to the City's existing sanitation facilities. The bonds the District proposed to issued, together with bonds previously issued and outstanding, totaled an amount in excess of two percent of the net assessed valuation of taxable property within the district. The taxpayer claimed that the issuance of the bonds was in conflict with Ind. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3, which prevented a municipal corporation from becoming indebted in an aggregate exceeding two percent of the value of taxable property within that corporation. The trial court entered judgment for appellees and overruled the taxpayer's motion for a new trial. On appeal, the court held that The District did not constitute a political or municipal corporation. The court noted that the District acted in the name of the City and that it could sue or be sued in the name of the City. The court concluded, therefore, that the legislature, when it created the District, did not create a separate entity or distinct municipality, but a special taxing district that was not subject to the restriction of Ind. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>

When the city began efforts to make the acquisitions, the taxpayers initiated an action to enjoin the city from issuing city obligation bonds. The trial court granted judgment to the city because it determined that the city's actions were valid exercises of the powers granted in the enabling legislation. The taxpayers asserted that: (a) the trial court erred when it refused to permit evidence that the city abused its discretion in enacting the ordinances; (b) 1947 Ind. Acts. ch. 288, which enabled the city action, violated Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 23; and (c) the bond ordinance was unreasonable and void. The court affirmed the decision that denied the taxpayers' request to enjoin the city because: (1) the off-street parking was a legislative function, and the courts could not examine the legislative process; (2) the provision of off-street parking did not discriminate against taxpayers who did not own cars; and (3) the taxpayers made no showing that the off-street parking ordinances were unreasonable and void.</SPAN></P>

The Board of Zoning Appeals (Board) denied the church's request for a variance, but the trial court reversed that decision. The Board appealed. Specifically, the Board contended that the church's plans did not comply with both the setback and parking requirements. The court found that the setback requirement was a reasonable exercise of the city's police power. However, the church could easily comply with that provision. On the other hand, the fact that there existed five other churches in the area without adequate off street parking such that they used the adjacent street parking, was evidence that the parking regulation was being applied unconstitutionally to the church, as a hindrance to freedom of worship. Thus, the trial court's judgment was reversed only insomuch as it was to restate its findings as a judgment.</SPAN></P>

While on parole, the prisoner committed second degree burglary and was convicted and sentenced to a jail term. Upon commitment, the Board of Trustees of the Indiana State Prison held a hearing and found the prisoner to be parole violator, requiring him to serve five years of his original sentences.

The prisoner filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, contending that he had completed serving his full maximum sentence for second degree burglary and that he was therefore entitled to discharge. The trial court granted the writ. On the State's appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in ordering the prisoner's release on writ of habeas corpus because the sentence imposed for burglary began to run on the date of the prisoner's discharge from the previous sentences. Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-2250 (1953) operated to postpone the execution of the sentence for second degree burglary until the other sentences had been served or annulled.</SPAN></P>

The statute violated the Fourth Amendment because probable cause was a judicial determination. However, defendant waived the issue by denying ownership or interest in the property seized or the premises. The grand jury could have inquired into the offenses out of order. Legal conclusions that the State improperly influenced the grand jury could not be considered in pleas of abatement. There was no abuse in discretion in failing to change venue from the county. The motions to quash on the basis of incomplete indictments were correctly denied. Stating the exact amount of money involved or the description or method of the game was not required. The parties could have stipulated to consolidating the indictments. When that was done, defendant could not later complain that they should have been separated. Defendant was not entitled to three peremptory challenges for each indictment. Finally, there were no errors in the jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After an Attorney General filed a brief with the court in which he confessed that the judgment should have been reversed, the court nonetheless addressed defendant's argument that the crime charged by affidavit was committed in Alabama and Florida and that under the Indiana Constitution, as well as the proper construction of Indiana statutes, no crime had been charged that was committed in Indiana. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment, which had convicted and sentenced defendant for bigamy. Specifically, the court held that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-4204 (Repl. 1942) had to have been construed as limited to the act of contracting a bigamous marriage within the State of Indiana and that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-4205 (Repl. 1942), purporting to deal with the venue of the offense and the trial, was not intended to attempt to give courts of Indiana jurisdiction over a bigamous marriage consummated in another state.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">After his arrest at about 12:30 a.m., defendant was taken to police headquarters. He argued that the trial court erred in admitting testimony as to his statements and condition at police headquarters because police had failed to comply with Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47-2307(4) (1952), requiring arrestees to be immediately taken before a magistrate in DUI cases. The court stated that it did not believe that the legislature intended to require an accused who was drunk or intoxicated to be brought before a magistrate. More important, the court stated, for &sect; 47-2307 to be construed to be constitutional, it had to be limited to bringing an accused before a magistrate during his usual hours for conducting court. To hold otherwise would violate Ind. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, which divided the powers of the Indiana government into three separate departments, in that the legislature would be attempting to hamper judicial functions or interfering with the discharge of judicial duties. The legislature could not require that magistrates conduct court 24 hours a day.</SPAN></P>

It found that the naming of the union meant its members and, by naming the individuals as a representative of the union and not as a representative of the members, agents, and employees of the union, the agents and employees were never properly made parties to the suit. The court affirmed the judgment in all other respects, as there was ample evidence to sustain the finding that the union representative did commit the assault and batter. Further, the complaint clearly charged the union representative as an individual with the assault and battery and sought also to recover from the members of the union on the theory that he was acting on their behalf when the assault and battery was committed.</SPAN></P>

After the motions were overruled, appellants filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking to have the trial court pass upon the statute's constitutionality. Following an unfavorable judgment, appellants sought review. Upon review, the court held that persons having a property interest that might be affected by a mala prohibita criminal statute could have their status, rights, and other legal relations with reference to such statute determined by declaratory judgment. However, the court held that there was no authority for seeking a declaratory judgment to determine the rights, status, and other legal relations of a party with respect to a mala in se criminal statute. The court also held that appellants' question had been determined and that a declaratory judgment action could not substitute for an appeal. Finally, the court held that the statute did not limit appellants' legal rights; thus, the Act was inapplicable because the Act only gave courts the power to declare legal rights, legal statuses, and other legal relations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The lessee, the school corporation, and the lessor, the building corporation, entered into a lease under which the lessor would finance the acquisition of certain land and the erection of a school building thereon. In addition to rent payments, the lessee was required to provide for repairs, insurance, and taxes. The lease also contained a purchase option. The taxpayers filed an action to set aside the lease, claiming that the lease violated Ind. Cont. art. 13, &sect; 1. The trial court entered a judgment for the lessee and lessor. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the fact that the lessee could, by paying a reasonable rental over a period of years, become the owner of the building, did not change the lease-contract into a contract to purchase the building, nor did it create a present indebtedness where none actually existed. Further, limitation of the activities in which the lessee and lessor might be required to engage in during the lease were impotent to effect such a change. Finally, because the evidence showed the necessity for the execution of the lease and that the rental was reasonable, no part of the rental payments could be purchase price payments in disguise.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Relators alleged that the judges were without jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the action because certain additional parties named in the petition were not made parties defendant in the action. The court held that it was clear under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-1101 (1946) and Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-1102 (1946), that the court and its judge had full and complete jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the action unless there was such a defect of parties defendant as to deprive them of jurisdiction thereof. Since it was undoubtedly the very purpose of the Declaratory Judgments Statute to give to &quot;any person&quot; whose rights, status or other legal relations were affected by a statute, the right to have any question of construction or validity arising under it determined and to have a declaration of rights, status or other legal relations thereunder, the court did not think that the jurisdiction of the trial court of the subject-matter of the action could possibly have depended upon whether everyone who might have had or claimed to have had an interest that would have been affected by the declaration were made parties to the action.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the petition, agreeing with appellees that its statutory jurisdiction to hear the controversy had not been timely invoked. The court affirmed. Pursuant to &sect; 53-783, a party aggrieved by any decision of the board had to present a petition to the trial court within 30 days of the decision. The statutory time limit was necessary so the trial court could enter an order that set the date to show cause why a writ should not issue and the time for the return of the writ. This procedure was jurisdictional and mandatory. Where a statute provided the remedy of judicial review and specified the procedure to be followed, an aggrieved party had to comply with the procedure. The statute was not unconstitutional because the procedure for review did not prohibit the remedy of judicial review. Because appellants had failed to present their petition to the court within the prescribed time, the trial court had not acquired jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

About 93 days after the city court judgment, the State filed its written motion to dismiss.

The 1935 Act was amended in the interim by 1937 Ind. Acts ch. 152, &sect; 1 (1937 Act), which allowed the parties to seek an extension of the 90-day period. Though the 1939 Act expressly repealed the 1935 Act, the 1937 Act was never repealed. The court held that, although only the 1935 Act was expressly repealed by the 1939 Act, the 1937 Act fell within the repeal, as the 1937 Act was not complete within itself or understandable and enforceable without reference to the 1935 Act.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed. The instruction given by the trial court did not define what was intended by the words &quot;if her testimony should be found sufficiently satisfactory to the jury,&quot; and the jury could easily have had the impression that a conviction would be authorized on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice even though the testimony did not convince the jury of defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The instruction purported to be complete on the subject of accomplices, and its giving to the jury was prejudicial error. The court also noted that the trial court erroneously admitted evidence that defendant's wife had given forged checks to other people. However, none of the recipients of the checks, nor any officer of the drawee bank testified that the checks were forged or fraudulent. The admission of the evidence of similar crimes was error because it did not make out a prima facie case of uttering forged documents.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted the telephone company's request for a temporary injunction. The Commission sought a writ of prohibition against the trial court. The court denied the Commission's request for a permanent writ, concluding that the trial court had the authority to review the Commission's order and to issue injunctions. The trial court's order did not attempt to fix rates but merely permitted the telephone company to charge certain rates to maintain the status quo or to preserve the telephone company's solvency until a final determination could be made due to the unenforceability of the Commission's insufficient order.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The permittees were charged with selling alcohol to a minor and their permit was suspended.

The superior court dissolved a restraining order issued against the Commission but granted a stay of judgment pending appeal. The Superior Court refused to discharge a rule brought against the Commission for failing to return the permit pending the appeal. On consideration of whether to make a temporary writ of prohibition permanent, the court held that (1) a restraining order and injunction would only be granted when property rights were involved, and &sect; 12-443(b) specifically provided that there was no property right in a beer and wine permit; (2) the superior court might have had jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter, but it had no jurisdiction over the class of case involved and so could not act; and (3) the superior court had no jurisdiction to issue a citation for contempt where it had no jurisdiction to issue the injunction in the first place.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Appellee city sought a declaratory judgment against appellant railway to determine the parties' rights under the grade separation statutes, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 48-3401 to 48-3410 (1950) and &sect;&sect; 55-1810 to 55-1812 (1951). The railway sought to have the statutes declared unconstitutional as applied to it. The Hancock Circuit Court (Indiana) declared the rights of the parties and held the statutes to be constitutional. The railway appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The railway refused to pay its share of the cost of a grade separation project. The railway argued that the Legislature did not grant to the city the right to apportion costs in grade separations, and that if the city's board of public works apportioned the costs its action was void because it did not have jurisdiction to do so, and the action was therefore unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1 and Ind. Const. art. 1. The court noted that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 55-1810 set out formulas for the division of costs of grade separation, but made no attempt to apportion the division, while Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-3402 (1950) provided for apportionment of the costs. The Legislature in setting up the division of costs did not attempt to apportion the costs and thus did not repeal the right of the board of public works to apportion the costs of the grade separation as provided in the division of costs. In both Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 48-3402 and 55-1810, a street railway company, where the highway was occupied by its tracks, was responsible for five per cent of the costs. The Legislature divided the costs, and left to the board of public works the apportionment of the costs as divided.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had full jurisdiction to decide whether a temporary injunction should have issued.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The city sanitary district was created by a city ordinance that adopted Ind. Stat.

The district then adopted a resolution to sell 30-year bonds of the district payable from a tax levy to be made annually by the board of sanitary commissioners on the taxable real and personal property in the district. The proceeds were to be used for the construction of sewers, pumps, and buildings. The taxpayer argued that the bonds were unconstitutional because they would create a city indebtedness beyond the two percent limitation in Ind. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1. The court agreed with the Department that the bonds were not payable out of the general fund of the municipalities in question, but out of a special fund to be raised by a special tax. Because such debts were not debts of the government subdivisions, they could not infringe Ind. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1. As a &quot;local public improvement,&quot; the sewage system justified the creation of a separate taxing district from which to raise funds to accomplish the extension and improvement of the sewers, pumps, and buildings.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from the judgment granting the petition, the court reversed. It was prejudicial error for the trial court to refuse to grant the warden's motion for a change of judge as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was a civil proceeding from which change of venue from the judge could be had under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2-1402 (1946). Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 22-4201 (1950) vested in the Indiana Council for Mental Health the right to transfer the patient. On its face, this transfer met the requirements of the statute. The Indiana Hospital for Insane Criminals was held not to be a penal institution. The transfer was not a violation of either the Constitution of Indiana or the Federal Constitution as due process was afforded to the patient at the time he was originally committed to the Indiana Village for Epileptics.</SPAN></P>

The taxpayers argued that the act made the licensing and regulation a tax measure, in violation of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The court disagreed and held that the challenged act was general and embracing one subject and, therefore, did not violate either state or federal constitutions. As to the severability of the portion of the act declared unconstitutional, the court held that the remaining portions were workable and severable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Unsuccessful political candidates for Indiana State Representative challenged the election of the successful candidates. The successful candidates argued that the circuit court was without jurisdiction of the subject matter of the action. That in ordering a recount of the ballots for the offices, the circuit court had exceeded its lawful jurisdiction, and that it would continue to act beyond its jurisdiction unless prohibited from so doing by the court. The court agreed. The court noted that Ind. Const. art. 4, &sect; 10, provided that the Indiana House of Representatives had sole and exclusive jurisdiction to judge the election, qualifications, and returns of its own members. The circuit court asserted that they assumed jurisdiction in the cases because of the authority granted by the Indiana Election Code art. 27, &sect;&sect; 324, 325. The court noted that the constitution was the supreme law that effectively controlled legislatures, congresses, executives, courts and the people. To the extent the statute in question sought to grant the power to review legislative elections to the courts, it was necessarily unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

The trial court appointed recount commissioners. At the time of recount an action for an alternative writ of mandamus and temporary writ of prohibition was granted, which stayed the recount. The contestee, who had received the majority of the votes in the election, alleged that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-5401 to 29-5417 (1949) was unconstitutional because it provided no provision for the contestee to contest a second certificate of election issued to a contestor. The court found that under Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 29-5413 (1949) when a recount was invoked, every candidate was protected because it required a court order to impound and protect all ballots, voting machines, tally sheets, and names and addresses of registered voters. The contestee also had the benefit of a recount in the presence of his watcher. The court further found that the contestee had a remedy by way of a quo warranto. Accordingly, the court vacated and remanded the mandamus and writ.</SPAN></P>

Several years later, while in the state reformatory, defendant moved to vacate the judgment of conviction. The State based a demurrer to defendant's motion on &sect; 9-3301, and argued that because more than five years had expired since defendant's conviction, the circuit court no longer had jurisdiction over the matter. The demurrer was overruled, as was the State's motion for a rehearing. The State then commenced an original action for a writ of prohibition against respondents. The court held that the State's petition should be denied. The court determined first that defendant's motion to vacate was in effect a motion for a writ of error coram nobis. The court then held that defendant should be allowed to present its case and the circuit court should be allowed to determine if defendant acted with due diligence in bringing the petition. Further, the court found that defendant's case was proper for the writ of error coram nobis because the issue of defendant's constitutional right to counsel was involved.</SPAN></P>

The court held this provision unconstitutional. However, the court also noted that the owners' constitutional questions were not properly presented to the trial court. The remonstrances did not specify any constitutional provision that was violated, and they were in any case dismissed on the owners' motion so that there was nothing of record before the trial court presenting any constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>

Under the Act, the word &quot;gross income&quot; meant total receipts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The grand jury accusation charged that there was cause to remove the sheriff based on incidents involving punchboards and an incident in which the sheriff allegedly told a lodge officer to allow the installation of a slot machine if he wanted the sheriff's help. The sheriff moved to dismiss the State's appeal on the ground that the State had no statutory authority to appeal. The court held that Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2-3201 (1946) provided for an appeal by the State from a final adverse judgment in proceedings for the removal of a county officer. Disregarding the evidentiary allegations as surplusage, and considering the averments of fact, the accusation stated sufficient cause for removal. While the sheriff correctly insisted that there was no statutory crime of conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor in Indiana, all persons concerned in the commission of a misdemeanor were liable as principals. As to the punchboard charge, the keeping or exhibiting of such devices was prohibited, but no laws prohibited an attempt to do the prohibited acts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendant appealed the life imprisonment sentence that he received following his conviction by the Vigo Circuit Court (Indiana) for vehicle taking. The application of the habitual criminal act, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9-2207 (1942), was central to the dispute between the parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At defendant's first trial on vehicle taking charges, there was a hung jury. The State then filed a second count for the offense of vehicle taking, and it alleged pursuant to &sect; 9-2207 that defendant was an habitual criminal. At his second trial, defendant was found guilty of vehicle taking, and he was found to have had two previous felony convictions. Thus, defendant was sentenced to life in prison. Upon appeal, the trial court's judgment was affirmed. The court held that &sect; 9-2207 did not charge a crime, but it only classified defendant as an habitual criminal. Thus, it did not make bad character a part of defendant's original case, and it was not impeaching. Further, &sect; 9-2207 did not impose an additional penalty on crimes for which defendant had already been convicted. Rather, it imposed a heavier penalty for the commission of a felony by one who had been previously twice convicted and imprisoned for the commission of a felony. Thus, &sect; 9-2207 was not an ex post facto law and did not violate U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 or Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 24. The court also ruled that neither Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-3010 (1942) nor Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-3011 (1942) repealed the habitual criminal act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Department took preliminary steps to build additions and improvements to a city hospital and to issue a large sum of bonds to defray the costs of the new facilities. The taxpayer filed an action to enjoin the Department, but the trial court found in favor of the Department. The taxpayer appealed and contended that the issuance of the bonds would constitute an evasion of the debt limitation imposed upon the city by the Ind. Const. art. 13. The court agreed and held that hospitals were not local improvements for which special assessments could be levied. The court held that the Acts of 1945, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 200, as amended by the Acts of 1947, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-8401, et seq., to the extent that the Acts permitted indebtedness beyond the two percent debt limitation of the city, were an evasion of the Indiana Constitution. The fact that the new bonds sought to be issued would not, if charged against the city, increase the city's indebtedness beyond two percent did not render the issuance of such bonds free from attack. They were issued according to procedure set up in the part of the Acts of 1945 and 1947, which the court found to be repugnant to the Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Section 9 of the Indiana Retail Installment Sales Act, Ind.

Subsequently, the finance company filed an action which sought to declare the amendment unconstitutional and sought to enjoin the department from enforcing the amendment. The trial court granted judgment in favor of the finance company. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the finance company had standing to challenge the amendment, despite the facts that it was a licensee under the act and the amendment had not gone into effect. The court concluded that although the amendment may have had a valid state purpose, the prohibition of a right to contract within another state concerning the property of the finance company within the state was a denial of due process of law and violated the Commerce Clause by restricting the market for contract sales and credit within the state.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the father contended that the original petition failed to confer jurisdiction of the person and subject matter and that the original judgment violated the Fifth Amendment on the ground that it was entered in the father's absence. The court affirmed, holding that: (1) the petition did not deprive the juvenile court of jurisdiction because the petition complied substantially with Ind. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Defendants, the Board of Commissioners of Adams County, Indiana, and others, sought review of a decision from the Adams Circuit Court (Indiana), which entered an order to issue bonds for the construction of a drain in an action brought by plaintiffs, a ditch commission and the owners of the land which was assessed for the construction of the drain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The trial court entered an order for the Board to issue bonds for the construction of a drain. The action was preceded by another case, with different participants, which resulted in a denial of the same mandatory relief and held that the proceeding was terminated by virtue of the Contractors Relief Act of 1919, 1919 Ind. Acts 93. On appeal, the court set the judgment aside, holding that the prior case barred relitigation of the same issues. The fact that the contractor named as relator in the first action was not the one named in the second action was immaterial. It was also immaterial that the statute upon which the trial court based its first finding and judgment was afterward declared unconstitutional. Jurisdiction in the trial court was not lost when the trial court entered a judgment that denied the relief sought. The trial court may have erred, but that error could have been corrected on appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The State of Indiana appealed from the judgment of the Lawrence County Circuit Court (Indiana) sustaining defendant's motion to quash an affidavit charging him with visiting a gambling house on grounds that the affidavit did not state a public offense, in that the applicable statute, Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10-4219 (1942), was unconstitutional and void under U.S. Const. amend. XIV; Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23; and Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 19, 22, and 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The statute prohibited &quot;male persons&quot; from, inter alia, visiting houses of ill fame or gambling houses. The affidavit was quashed, and defendant was discharged, on his claim that the statute contained an unconstitutional classification and violated his privileges and immunities. In reversing on appeal, the court ruled that the title of the act at issue gave fair notice of its contents so as not to mislead those to be bound, as required by Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 19. The statute did not grant a privilege or immunity to anyone and its limitation to male persons was a reasonable classification founded on substantial distinctions in the subject matter and designed to protect the morals and welfare of the public, consistent with Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The statute applied to all who came within its provisions and did not violate the special law and general law provisions of Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 22 and 23. Finally, defendant could not claim a privilege to visit a gambling house or be immune from regulation under the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The judgment was reversed and the case was remanded with instructions to overrule the motion to quash and for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The Commission sought the owners' property for the construction of a highway. On their property, the owners operated a retail store and gasoline station. At the jury trial before the circuit court, the owners presented evidence as to the store's annual business and the station's annual sales of gasoline. The State requested that the circuit court instruct the jury that, among other things, the owners were not entitled to recover for any loss of business or profits; the circuit court refused the State's request. On appeal from the owners' judgment, the court held that the evidence pertaining to the store's business and the station's gasoline sales was properly admitted to prove that the appropriated property was suitable for business purposes. The court also held that the circuit court properly refused the State's tendered instruction regarding losses of business or profits because Ind. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-1706 (1946) authorized such damages in an appropriation case. Specifically, because the first three clauses of &sect; 3-1706 provided damages sustained by property taken, the fourth clause of &sect; 3-1706 necessarily referred to damages other than damages to the property involved.</SPAN></P>

Because he was previously charged with stalking, defendant's second count was enhanced, even though defendant was acquitted of the first charge. The court held the evidence supported a finding that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. It did not matter that the harassment occurred over a period of only several hours. Defendant's harassing behavior occurred more than once, and was thus deemed &quot;repeated&quot; under the statute. The evidence supported a finding that the victim actually felt terrorized. The enhancement of defendant's penalty based on the prior stalking charge was constitutional since the pending stalking charge was proved beyond a reasonable doubt, defendant was not deprived of a jury trial and the enhancement was related to the characteristics of stalkers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The jury in the lower court convicted defendant of bribery and official misconduct.

The court next weighed and assessed the sufficiency of the evidence in support of the convictions, in order to ensure that any retrial would not be barred by principles of double jeopardy. When the jury instructions were considered together, the court determined that the jury was adequately instructed that the &quot;property&quot; defendant was accused of accepting was money.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">At 2:20 a.m., two police officers on patrol stopped a car being driven erratically.

After exiting the car, defendant responded that he had a weapon under the front driver's seat. The officer looked and could see the gun sticking out underneath the seat. Defendant was charged with carrying a handgun without a license. The court held that prior to making an inquiry about the presence of weapons an officer must: (1) either be warranted in believing that his safety was threatened; or (2) the question must reasonably relate to the basis for the traffic stop, such as stopping a suspected armed burglar or bank robber. Because neither was present, the gun must be suppressed as a fruit of the illegal question.</SPAN></P>

The weight of the rock cocaine was 8.9 grams. The court held that: (1) because defendant failed to file a motion to dismiss raising a constitutional challenge to Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-6, the claim was waived; (2) the argument that Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-6 was unconstitutionally vague because it failed to set forth a specific method for measuring the 1,000 foot &quot;drug-free zone&quot; failed on its own merits, waiver notwithstanding, because there is nothing indefinite or uncertain in its language; and (3) the jury instruction that stated a surveyor's line-of-sight technique was an appropriate method of measurement was proper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">Petitioners, the adoptive parents of respondent's son, petitioned for a permanent protective order seeking to stop respondent's continuing efforts to challenge the adoption and contact their son. Acting pro se respondent moved the court for appointment of pauper counsel to represent him in the protective order hearing. In support of his motion respondent made uncontroverted representations that he was incarcerated, had no income, property, or assets, and that he could not afford to hire counsel. On appeal, respondent asserted the trial court erred in denying him pauper counsel in the hearing on the permanent protective order. Holding that respondent's uncontroverted representations of indigency could not be reconciled with Ind. Code &sect; 34-1-1-3, now Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 34-10-1-1 and -2, the State pauper statute, the court reversed and remanded with instructions to appoint counsel, or, in the alternative, to conduct a hearing to determine whether respondent was indigent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c9">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">The court reversed and remanded, holding that, given respondent's uncontroverted representations of his own indigency, the State's pauper counsel statute required the trial court to appoint respondent counsel or hold a hearing to determine respondent's indigency.</SPAN></P>
