Defendant had burglarized his former place of employment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to simple burglary and was sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor for five years. Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court imposed an excessive sentence. The court held that the trial court adequately considered the presentence investigation (PSI) report and its relevance in sentencing defendant. The PSI report indicated that defendant had never held a job for any length of time and that he was fired by several employers. This included his job at the burglarized mill, from which he was fired the week before the offense because of his refusal to work. Factors contributing to defendant's failure to maintain employment were his inability to get along with his employers, his limited job skills, and his inability to read or write. The court noted that defendant's sentence of five years at hard labor was in the lower range and was not excessive due to the seriousness of the offense and the general lack of mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two women approached a college professor and grabbed his crotch. As the professor bent forward, the two women pushed him against a building, took his wallet and fled.Defendant asserted the trial court erred by allowing inadmissible hearsay testimony by an arresting officer into evidence. The court held that the testimony was not admitted to prove that defendant committed the robbery, but rather was purely introductory and explanatory as to why, where, and how he pursued and subsequently arrested defendant. Even assuming that the testimony was hearsay, the college professor's identification of defendant rendered any error harmless.Defendant also contended that the state failed to prove that she intended to participate in a robbery instead of a theft in which the use of force or intimidation was not required. The court held that based on the circumstances, a rational trier of fact could have found that defendant used force or intimidation in the perpetration of the crime. Defendant waived her objection to an allegedly improper &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; charge by failing to make a contemporaneous objection, and a departure from the rule against the &quot;plain error&quot; doctrine was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board suspended the owners' alcohol licenses for an unlawful sale of an alcoholic beverage to a minor. The trial court determined that judicial review would not be by a trial de novo but would be by a review of the Board record pursuant to Parish of East Baton Rouge and City of Baton Rouge, La., Code &sect; 1:153. Section 1:153 limited the trial court's scope of an appeal of a Board decision. The trial court affirmed the Board's decision based on a review of the record. In reversing the trial court's decision, the court held that &sect; 1:153 was unconstitutional insofar as it attempted to provide for procedures in the judicial branch of state government. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:4788, enacted by the legislative branch of state government, prescribed the proper procedure to be followed by the trial court, and that was a trial de novo.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

The Commission held that unemployment compensation received by the employee would be set-off against back wages, that attorney fees in excess of $ 500 would not be assessed, and that interest on back wages would not be allowed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wrecker businesses attacked the ordinance as facially invalid. The wrecker business alleged that the council acted arbitrary and capricious in establishing the rates and that the ordinance violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 45.180.1. On appeal, the judgment was affirmed and amended. First, the court held that although the committee members testified that the rate decrease was primarily based upon towing rates from other metropolitan areas in other parts of the state and country they also considered information from individuals in the wrecker business concerning the increase in the cost of doing business. The council's decision was not arbitrary. In addition, the court noted that &sect; 45:180.1 did not delineate any criteria for establishing the rates in emergency tows. Second, the exclusionary language contained in the ordinance made it clear that the ordinance did not regulate wrecker businesses operating exclusively in other parishes and &sect; 45:180.1 did not prohibit the Council from regulating the operation of wreckers from other municipalities when they were operating within its jurisdiction. The judgment was amended because the application fees violated &sect; 45:180.1D.</SPAN></P>

The action included a tort claim against another employee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee filed a workers compensation action in the trial court before filing her claim with the office of worker's compensation. The court dismissed the claim as premature, and the employee appealed. She claimed that the Louisiana Worker's Compensation Act was unconstitutional because, inter alia, it denied her due process and equal protection, and it unreasonably delayed her access to the courts. On review, the court found that the employee had no procedural due process claim since her alleged property interest of receiving worker's compensation benefits was not adversely affected by state action. Consequently, La. Rev. Stat. Ann.&sect; 23:1311 et seq. did not violate her due process rights. Further, the statute did not deny the employee equal protection of the law. The court agreed with the employer's contention that the adjudication requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act did not apply to the initial recommendation stage because the director's recommendation was not a final disposition, and the 30-day waiting period did not violate a claimant's constitutional right of access to the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department asserted that the oil company owed unpaid severance taxes and accrued statutory interest on oil that was produced from certain wells. The oil company argued that the wells at issue were stripper wells and that it timely and correctly paid what was due, and that it should have been taxed only at the lower stripper-well rate. The matter proceeded to court where the department was granted summary judgment. The oil company sought review. On appeal, the court examined La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:635 concerning the severance tax issues. The court examined statutory changes to this statute as well as other legislation and determined that the legislature was prohibited by La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 15 from releasing the oil company's liability for severance taxes that became due to the department at the times in question. This was because the oil company's tax obligation arose when the tax became due under the statute levying the tax. Therefore, the amount determined was proper.</SPAN></P>

The trial court then heard a multiple bill of information filed by the prosecution and resentenced defendant to 15 years at hard labor as a multiple offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. He was tried and found guilty as charged by a 12-member jury. The trial court sentenced him to 15 years at hard labor. Seven months later, the State filed a multiple bill of information pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1 charging defendant with being a multiple offender. Defendant filed a Motion to Quash, which was denied by the trial court. After a hearing, defendant admitted that he pleaded guilty to forcible rape in 1988. His prior sentence was vacated and he was resentenced to 15 years at hard labor as a multiple offender. The court affirmed, finding that because defendant received an original sentence of 15 years, the State's delay in filing the multiple bill was not untimely. The court found that the trial court adequately considered the guidelines in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 in sentencing defendant. The court held that defendant's sentence was not excessive in light of the fact that he had prior convictions of forcible rape and possession of cocaine. The court also noted that defendant was not given the maximum sentence either on original sentencing or under the Habitual Offender Statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court convicting defendant of the distribution of cocaine, and imposing a sentence of 15 years as a habitual offender, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which convicted and sentenced him for possession of stolen property valued at more than $ 500 in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:69(A), as charged by the state. After a jury trial defendant was sentenced to three years at hard labor with credit for time served and ordered to pay $ 159 in court costs or serve 39 days in jail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer testified that as he pulled his unmarked police car alongside a car that was stopped at a traffic light, he noticed that there was no key in the ignition. Suspecting that the car may be stolen, he ran a check of the license plate number and confirmed his suspicion. The officer arrested defendant and charged him with possession of a stolen vehicle. At trial, the owner testified that the car had been stolen from near his apartment. Defendant, while testifying in his own behalf, stated that he had borrowed the car. He was found guilty and sentenced to three years at hard labor with credit for time served. He was also ordered to pay $ 159 in court costs or serve thirty days in jail in default there. On review, the court determined that because defendant was indigent, imposition of a sentence requiring him to serve additional jail time in default of the payment of court costs was unconstitutional. In all other regards, the judgment below was correct. The evidence was sufficient to convict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that convicted defendant of possession of stolen property, but it amended the sentence to delete the requirement that he serve additional time in lieu of payment of a fine.</SPAN></P>

Acts 168 could not be applied retroactively to a dealership contract between the dealer and appellee manufacturer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer and the dealer made a dealership contract. It was entered into before the passage of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:774(J)(3) [enacted by 1987 La. Acts 168]. Section 32:774(J)(3) provided that a manufacturer or distributor of marine products could not unfairly without just cause or provocation cancel the franchise of any marine dealer; it also provided for notice of cancellation. The trial court ruled that &sect; 32:774(J)(3) could not be applied retroactively and granted summary judgment dismissing the dealer's claims. On appeal, the court rejected the dealer's argument that the manufacturer's defense was barred by res judicata because of a prior adjudication. On the merits, the court ruled that the contract was legal when it was made; the parties had consented to the terms of a legal contract and were bound by it; &sect; 32:774(J)(3) could not be retroactively applied to alter the obligations of that contract even though it expired, and the manufacturer declined to renew it after the effective date of &sect; 32:774(J)(3). The ruling was based on the La. Const. art. I, &sect; 23, which prohibited the legislature from enacting any law that impaired the obligation of a contract.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to the railroad companies' purchase of railroad properties, the Commission significantly increased the tax assessment on the two properties. The companies contended that the increase in their assessments occurred during a period when the Commission either reduced or held constant the assessment of property owned by other Louisiana railroads. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the action to the Commission for a redetermination of the fair market value and assessment of the properties in accordance with law. The court found that the Commission did not comply with the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1853B in determining the fair market value of the companies' railroad properties and that the resulting assessments were in violation of the uniformity provisions of La. Const. art. 7, &sect; 18D. The court determined that the Commission arbitrarily assigned unequal weights to the cost approach and the income approach and that the extremely disproportionate weighing of the already unacceptable differences in value amplified the disparity in determining fair market value.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, and remanded the case with instructions that the employee be permitted to amend her petition to state a cause of action. It held that where pursuant to La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The father filed an action in October 1988 for damages occasioned by fire that occurred in July of 1980. It was alleged that the fire occurred when a gas heater manufactured by the manufacturing company supplied with natural gas by the gas company ignited flammable vapors that caused a fire or explosion, which resulted in permanent injuries to the minor. In response to the action, the gas company and manufacturer filed exceptions of no cause of action based on La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3492, which permitted prescription to run on the minor's tort claim during her minority. The lower court sustained the exceptions of no cause of action. On appeal, the father sought to dismiss the appeal against the manufacturer and alleged that art. 3492 violated equal protection. The court granted the motion to dismiss and affirmed. The court held that art. 3492 did not violate equal protection because the limitation period set forth in art. 3492 was substantially related to the state's interest in promoting justice and it did not impinge upon the fundamental right of a suspect class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F), after his motion to quash was denied. Defendant appealed, alleging that the wording of &sect; 40:067(F), which predicated punishment on the total weight of a mixture containing a detectable amount of cocaine, was unconstitutional. The court held that the constitutional requirement of definiteness as it applied to statutes was satisfied when the language of the criminal enactment had a generally accepted meaning such that a person of ordinary intelligence would have been given fair notice of what conduct was forbidden, or when the crucial words or phrases in the criminal statute had a fixed and definite meaning for a person of ordinary intelligence. Here, the word &quot;detectable&quot; as used in &sect; 40:067(F), had a distinct meaning, and any reasonable person could understand that any mixture containing any amount of cocaine or its related substances was prohibited. Therefore, the wording of &sect; 40:067(F) was not vague, the State had a strong interest in suppressing illegal drug activity, and the statutory penalties were not cruel, unusual, or excessive. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

He offered a law course of pro se litigation. He was convicted of the unauthorized practice of law in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 37:213. The court reversed his conviction and vacated the sentence. The court held that the fact that defendant has assisted students in their studies in a &quot;common law&quot; course simply did not constitute the practice of law. Nor was the ownership of a &quot;law library&quot; necessarily indicative of the practice of law. The court also found that that defendant's title of &quot;Counsellor at Common Law&quot;, accompanied by an explanation that he was not a licensed attorney, but was, rather, a pro se litigant, did not convey a misleading impression that defendant was an attorney. The court also noticed that the State failed to introduce any witness who had been misled into believing defendant was a licensed attorney.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction asserting that the evidence did not support his conviction and that his sentence was excessive. The court upheld the trial court's judgment. First, the court held that the evidence sufficiently supported the conviction. The court reasoned that ample evidence was presented from which a rational trier of fact could have found that defendant committed the offense as charged, beyond a reasonable doubt. Secondly, the court held that defendant's sentence was not excessive in nature. Moreover, the court held that the trial court thoroughly applied La. Code Crim. Proc.

The unlicensed broker then called the broker in an attempt to associate himself with someone who could sell the property. The property owner sold the property to a wealthy individual. Both the property owner and the unlicensed broker felt each alone were responsible for the sale. The property owner filed an action, which sought to declare that he did not owe any real estate fee or commission to the unlicensed broker or the broker. The lower court held that the property owner did not owe the broker or the unlicensed broker any real estate fee or commission, and that no contract existed between the broker and the property owner for a commission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A father filed an action to disavow paternity of a minor child born, but not conceived, during his marriage with the mother. The trial court sustained the exceptions filed by the child through the curator. The court held that, although the trial court was correct in dismissing the action, the right of disavowal was extinguished by a plea of peremption supplied by the court, rather than prescription. The court held that the disavowal petition, which was filed three years after the birth of which the father had immediate knowledge, was not timely filed within the peremptive period of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 189. The mother's deceptions and discussions about adoption did not prevent plaintiff from filing within 180 days after he received the report that he was not the father. The court did not reach the constitutionality of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 188 because the trial court was clearly wrong in applying it and ruling that the father failed to state a cause of action because the petition did not allege that he knew the mother was pregnant at the time of their marriage. The court found that the curator's fees were reasonable except those for oral argument and travel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment as amended to reflect that the father's action was dismissed on a plea of prescription supplied by the court.

Defendants contended that the statute they were charged under was unconstitutionally vague and that the penalty provided was excessive under La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20. The court affirmed and held that the statute was not unconstitutional and the legislature's choice of punishment for taking game fish by illegal means was not unreasonably related to the preservation of a finite natural resource and was a matter of substantial regulatory interest to the lawmaking branch of government. The court further held that the penalty provision of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56:346 was reasonably related to preventing the deterioration of the state's wildlife resources. The court did not rule on the issue of the excessiveness of the sentence because it reversed the sentence since the probationary period imposed exceeded the two-year period authorized by La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover police officer purchased crack cocaine from defendant using marked bills.

In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for mistrial. A police officer's passing statement during the defense's cross-examination about observing defendant making transactions just prior to the police buy was not a reference to other crimes that prejudiced defendant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with possession of cocaine, which arose out of a single incident. Both defendants filed motions to suppress and the district court denied the motions. Each defendant then withdrew his plea of not guilty, pled guilty, reserved his right to appellate review of his motion to suppress. The court reversed the convictions and sentences and remanded, stating that the officer did not have probable cause to arrest defendants for criminal trespass. He admitted that his normal practice in such a situation would have been to simply tell defendants to get off the property. There was no evidence of an intentional entry; hence, defendants' arrests were illegal. Further, the court stated that the inventory search was clearly a subterfuge, used by the officers to search the car for evidence of illegal activity, the only evidence of which existed was the officer's assertion that when he talked to the defendants he recognized a single white speck in one of their mustaches as rock cocaine. The vehicle was under the control of the police officers, and they had plenty of time to obtain a search warrant if they had probable cause to search the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and found that that father challenged the mechanics of the test, and the actual tests performed on the blood. The court found that the language of the statute provided for the use of blood tests, but did not predetermine the use of a particular test because the legislature intended the use of the most scientific methods available at the time the testing was to be done. The court noted that the lack of specific qualifications of those who drew the blood gave the trial court an amount of discretion in the matter. The court held that the blood test was performed in a reasonable manner, that the state had a legitimate interest in the establishment of the paternity of children, and that the tests did not intrude on the father's constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

Acts 442 and left her father &quot;his forced portion of my estate.&quot; Prior to his demise, the legally interdicted father's curatrix filed a petition to annul the probated testament because the testator's intent was violated by the executor's failure to recognize the father's forced portion. On appeal from the trial court's adverse judgment and after the father's death, his succession representative argued that the repeal of the parental forced portion was inapplicable. In affirming, the court ruled that the record supported the trial court's finding that the testator intended to leave her father only his forced portion, which was nothing at the time of her death. The court ruled also that the language of the repeal did not lend itself to any other interpretation than that if a person died after December 31, 1981, regardless of when that person executed his will, the legislature intended that 1981 La. Acts 442 apply to that person's succession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was involved in an automobile accident with another driver. At the time of the accident, the driver was in the course and scope of his employment and was driving his own vehicle.

At the time of the accident, the vehicle driven by the driver was not specifically listed on the schedule of any of the insurance policies by the insurers. The insurance polices were issued to his employer and provided coverage to any vehicle owned by the employer. The court affirmed the judgment from the trial court. The court noted that under the automobile liability policy, it excluded coverage for liability on non-owned automobiles, but the exclusion did not apply to uninsured motorists coverage and absent a waiver of U.M. coverage, he was insured under the U.M. coverage to the extent of the liability limits of the policy. The combined risk insurer was also liable because under its policy it was presumed to have U.M. coverage unless specifically rejected in writing. The court noted that you could have U.M. coverage on a policy where there was no liability coverage.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought suit on behalf of his minor child, whose mother was killed when the vehicle she was driving collided with a train. Plaintiff argued the city was negligent when it failed to erect adequate signs to warn motorists of the approaching trains. The city argued it was immune from liability pursuant to &sect; 9:2798.1, and the trial court agreed. Whether or not to place warning signs at a particular intersection or crossing was a decision which the governing authority must make. The court held that whether or not the exercise of discretion by a governmental entity was a policy-making decision as contemplated by &sect; 9:2798.1, or an operational decision, was a question of fact. Likewise, whether the exercise of discretion was protected by the discretionary immunity statute, or whether it was &quot;willful, outrageous, reckless, or flagrant misconduct&quot; was also a factual question. Because such factual issues remained, the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment. In light of the reversal on the first issue, the court refused to consider the question of the constitutionality of &sect; 9:2798.1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the Secretary contended the trial court erred in ordering answers to certain interrogatories and the production of certain documents privileged under La.

The taxpayers replied that the Secretary waived his right to object by failing to timely object and, in the alternative, his objection of confidentiality under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1508 was not valid. The court found that the taxpayers had petitioned for declaratory relief and refund of taxes and interest paid under protest. This was not a suit in the administration or enforcement of the tax laws of the state within the purview of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1501 et seq. Thus, the exception to the mandatory prohibitions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1508 was inapplicable, and the information sought by the taxpayers was not discoverable. The taxpayers were not permitted access to other taxpayers' records in the custody of the Secretary. The trial court erred in holding that the answers to certain specified interrogatories and certain requests for production of documents were not confidential and in granting the motion to compel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court made peremptory the writ issued, reversed the judgment of the trial court granting the motion to compel the specified interrogatories and requests for production of documents which were objected to, and denied the motion to compel answers to interrogatories and request for production of documents objected to.

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in not granting a recess so that a witness, deputy sheriff, could obtain his notes for inspection by defense. The court held that failure of defense to object to the denial of the request waived the objection. Defendant claimed that the trial court should not have recognized as an expert witness the individual who testified on the analysis and identification of the cocaine. The court held that the fact that this was the witness's first case as an expert witness did not prevent him from being recognized as an expert. Defendant complained about a trial court's ruling which limited his cross-examination of a deputy.

The company argued that the court's decision, which denied coverage for protection and indemnity insurance under the &quot;ocean marine&quot; exclusion to Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association (LIGA) coverage, impaired its vested rights under the contract. The court disagreed. The 1982 contract of insurance between the two did not give the company any vested rights to coverage by LIGA.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two attorneys were appointed to serve as counsel for indigent criminal defendants. They were notified that the indigent defender board, their usual source of compensation, would not be able to pay for their services. The trial court denied their motions for reasonable compensation. On an application for a writ, the court affirmed the trial court's denial of their motions and denied further review. The court held that pursuant to La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13 the mandate to provide a system to compensate counsel for indigent criminal defendants was squarely directed at the legislature. The court held that it could, if a proper showing were made, consider relief for counsel for indigent defendants but that such a showing was not made by the two attorneys. From their application, the court could not conclude that the amount of time expended by either attorney in an unstated time frame was unduly burdensome so as to amount to an unconstitutional taking, deprivation, or involuntary servitude. It also could not determine whether the load on the two attorneys was inequitably imposed or whether because of the press of time, appointed counsel per se was ineffective counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the buyer orally agreed to purchase appellants' stock. The trial court overruled the buyer's exception of no cause of action on the claim, but granted summary judgment in his favor pursuant to the statute of frauds, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 10:8-319. Section 10:8-319 clearly required a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement was sought, but appellants argued that it did not apply to private sales. Because no Louisiana law interpreted the provisions of &sect; 10:8-319, the court considered the jurisprudence of other states and the federal court system. Based on the holdings of other state courts, the court held that because there was no signed writing which evidenced the agreement, appellants' claim was unenforceable. Appellants argued that the buyer's agreement to purchase the stock was enforceable under &sect; 10:8-319 (d), which allowed an oral agreement to be proven by admission of the opposing party. The court noted that the buyer admitted he intended to purchase the stock, but the court held there was no evidence of an actual contract to purchase the stock.</SPAN></P>

Although the taxpayers' claim that other properties were undervalued was an equal protection claim and thus a legality claim that would have allowed them to sue defendants within 30 days of payment pursuant to La. Rev. Sat. Ann. &sect; 47:2110, the taxpayers failed to show a lack of uniformity through undervaluation for any length of time. Thus, there was no factual basis in the record to support their claim.

The court affirmed the judgment holding that defendant had effective assistance of counsel during all stages of his case. Defendant failed to show any deficiency on the part of his attorneys or how he was prejudiced by the change of court appointed counsel. The court ruled defendant's motion to sever was properly denied, because his motion was not filed at the time of the hearing and he was tried alone. Because the State never conducted a fingerprint analysis test on the plastic bag, defendant's request to have the State fingerprint the item was properly denied. The court ruled that defendant's sentence was not excessive based on his criminal record and his status as a habitual offender. The court held that the imposition of the fine, without providing for a jail term in the event of a default, was not excessive or an illegal sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While working as a deputy sheriff, the decedent suffered a stroke. The wife of the decedent and their four minor children filed a wrongful death action against the sheriff, the state and its insurer, claiming that his death was caused by negligence and discriminatory acts of the sheriff. Initially, the wife and survivors filed a worker's compensation claim, which was dismissed. The insurer filed a peremptory exception of prescription in the wrongful death action. The wife and survivors contended that the worker's compensation claim saved from prescription the tort action which was filed more than one year after the death. The trial court sustained the peremptory exception of prescription and dismissed the wife and survivor's wrongful action. The court held that the wife and survivors' worker's compensation action did not give fair notice to their claim for damages for alleged tortious acts of the sheriff and the insurer. The court noted that action was therefore properly dismissed because the action prescribed under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. &sect; 3492.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Section I (Louisiana). The trial court convicted defendant of possession of cocaine, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(C)(2), and the trial court sentenced defendant to four years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant discarded a matchbox containing cocaine after he was approached by two officers as he sat inside a parked car in the middle of the street. Defendant, who was convicted of possession of cocaine and sentenced to four years at hard labor, argued on appeal that the trial court's definition of reasonable doubt in the jury charge was erroneous. The court affirmed. The jury charge contained language on reasonable doubt that was almost identical to the language that was condemned in Cage, a U.S. Supreme Court case. In Cage, the Supreme Court held that the phrases &quot;grave uncertainty,&quot; &quot;actual substantial doubt,&quot; and &quot;moral certainty&quot; could lead a reasonable juror to reach a guilty verdict based on a degree of proof below that required by the due process clause. However, defendant had failed to object at trial to the charge. Consistent with La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 841 and 801, Louisiana appellate courts had refused to consider arguments on jury charges where no contemporaneous objections were made. The court declined defendant's invitation to apply the clear error rule, which was not applied except in unusual circumstances not present in the instant case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, New Orleans Public Service, Inc. (NOPSI) and the Alliance for Affordable Energy (Alliance), each appealed the rate order decided by the New Orleans City Council (Council) and its reasons for judgment. The rate order decision was affirmed by the Civil District Court of the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Council found that 31 percent of the Grand Gulf nuclear power plant costs incurred by NOPSI, a producer, wholesaler, and retailer of electricity, were incurred imprudently. The ultimate questions in this consolidated appeal were whether NOPSI acted prudently or imprudently in its oversight and management of its participation in the Grand Gulf construction project and who should bear the excessive cost overruns of this project--the ratepayers of New Orleans or the stockholders of NOPSI. On appeal, the court held that: 1) there was no merit in NOPSI's contention that all its Grand Gulf costs should be passed on to the ratepayers, 2) the prudence investigation by the Council was legal and proper, 3) NOPSI waived its right to assert a &quot;system defense&quot; and claim that it had no responsibility to make independent studies or conduct discussions, 4) the escalation in costs was not unforeseeable as prudent utility management in NOPSI could not have been unaware of the cost implications for power plant construction, and 5) the reasons articulated by the Council for reducing the disallowance of the pass through to the ratepayers were insufficient and contrary to law and public policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the rate order of the Council and the district court in its findings that NOPSI imprudently incurred approximately 31 percent of its Grand Gulf costs. The court amended the rate order to disallow the pass through by NOPSI to the ratepayers of New Orleans of any of the imprudently incurred costs.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the doctor testified before the commission as to the precise methods used in determining whether the horse's urine specimen contained any illegal substances. The court found that the commission's findings and conclusions were not manifestly erroneous or arbitrary. The court found that the commission functioned as a civil administrative body and its proceedings were not equivalent to criminal trials.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer's unincorporated property bordered defendant city's boundary. An adjacent owner agreed to pay defendant city an 8 percent sales tax. The developer never agreed to pay the tax. Defendant parish created a tax district including the developer's property and levied a 2 percent tax. This subjected the developer's property to a 10 percent total tax. The developer claimed he lost prospective lessees and financing for his development. The court found that there was no taking of the property. The tax was validly levied, no business was operating on the developer's property, and he had not paid any taxes. In sustaining a no cause of action as to the developer's request for a declaratory judgment, the trial court took judicial notice of an agreement between defendants in error under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 931. The tort claim was properly dismissed because the developer did not timely contest annexation, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:175, and annexation was a discretionary act providing immunity under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 934. Developer could not amend his petition to state a &sect; 1983 claim, as there was no violation of a clearly established constitutional right.</SPAN></P>

The court also determined that the videotape seized by the undercover police officer was proper, and was not illegal. In addition, the court stated the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the admission of a diagram was lawful, since it was an aid to the jury in understanding testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother filed suit against the putative father to establish his paternity of her minor child and for past and future child support. The putative father contended that the trial court erred in dismissing his exception to jurisdiction because the mother failed to allege the facts required in order to obtain jurisdiction under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:3201(A)(7). The court found that the putative father stipulated that the mother alleged that the child was conceived in the state. Under the express terms of the present long arm statute, the sole inquiry into jurisdiction over a nonresident was a one-step analysis of the constitutional due process requirements. If the assertion of jurisdiction met the constitutional requirements of due process, the assertion of jurisdiction was authorized under the long arm statute. Under this standard the mother's allegation that defendant fathered the child in question and the party's stipulation that the child was conceived in the state were sufficient to establish the minimum contacts necessary to assert personal jurisdiction over the putative father under La.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant doctor challenged a judgment from the 24th Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson, Louisiana, which was rendered in favor of plaintiff survivors finding the doctor individually and vicariously liable for medical malpractice that had resulted in the death of the survivors' decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient suffered a boating accident that left him paralyzed in the right arm and the right diaphragm. The doctor performed surgery to relieve pain the patient was suffering. The surgery resulted in necrosis of the spinal cord, and the patient died from the collapsing of his lungs. The survivors filed a medical malpractice action against the doctor and defendants, the hospital and a resident the doctor left to monitor the patient after the surgery. Prior to trial, a settlement released the hospital and the resident, but reserved rights against the doctor individually and vicariously for the resident. A jury apportioned liability 40 percent to the doctor, 50 percent to the resident, and 10 percent to the hospital. On appeal, the court dismissed the claims against the doctor. The doctor breached no standard of care in his treatment of the patient. The doctor was not independently or vicariously liable for the resident's lack of timely intervention when the patient began suffering from a reduction in movement after the surgery. The doctor did not breach the applicable standard of care by leaving the resident, who was a licensed medical doctor, in charge of his recovering patient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the judgment of the trial judge, reversed the jury finding of individual and vicarious liability of the doctor and dismissed the survivors' medical malpractice claims against the doctor. The court remanded the survivors' action in the consolidated case against the Patient's Compensation Fund.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant challenged, in a consolidated appeal, decisions from the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and appellee Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regarding its hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal permit application. The applicant sought a declaration that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:2024, providing the procedure for appeal of the Department's decisions, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Department issued the applicant a permit for hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal. The applicant filed an action in the district court seeking judicial review of the decision because of differences between the final permit issued and the draft permit on which the hearing was held. The applicant requested a declaration that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:2024 was unconstitutional. The court consolidated the action with the applicant's direct appeal of the Department's decision. Insofar as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:2024 circumvented the original jurisdiction of all civil matters and exclusive original jurisdiction of cases involving the State as a defendant that had been constitutionally granted to the district courts, it was held unconstitutional. The Department was not subject to a constitutional exception from the normal method of appeal from an executive agency decision. The public rights doctrine was held inapplicable in Louisiana. An adequate provision was made in the Louisiana Constitution for the vesting of quasi-judicial powers in administrative agencies, and the legislature had authority to provide for and legislate regarding trial courts of limited jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the district court decision, finding that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal from the Department's decision regarding the applicant's permit application.

The court held that the use of convictions obtained prior to the effective date of La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beverage distributor instituted suit for declaratory judgment and a tax refund against the department of revenue and taxation. The trial court held that the beverage distributor's petition did not state a cause of action for declaratory judgment. On appeal, the court noted that the distributor was seeking to have La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:342, which imposed an excise tax on beverages of low alcoholic content, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:4301, which authorized certain tax exemptions to Louisiana manufacturers, declared unconstitutional as being discriminatory against distributors of beverages of low alcoholic content brewed outside of Louisiana. The court noted that the board of tax appeals had authority under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 47:1481 to grant a tax refund when taxes were not paid under protest, if the tax was subsequently found unconstitutional and principles of justice and equity required a refund.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded not guilty, and a six-person jury convicted him of exposing himself in public. The state then filed a bill of information charging him with being a quadruple felony offender under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. The defendant was so adjudicated, and sentenced to serve the minimum period of 21 years at hard labor, without benefit of parole or good time. Defendant's sole assignment of error was whether the multiple offender statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. He also argued that the minimum statutory sentence under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1, 21 years at hard labor, without benefit of parole or good time, was unconstitutionally excessive for his crime. On review, the court found that defendant had at least three prior felony convictions, and based on the record, he was a career criminal.La. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15:529.1 did not impose an unconstitutionally excessive punishment. Further, defendant's argument that he should not receive more than the statutory maximum for a substantive crime would require a finding that the trial court could never apply the habitual offender law.

The court also found that overwhelming evidence was presented at trial that the killing was not a justifiable act of self-defense.

Ann. &sect; 32:51 required a vehicle license and provided that no person could operate any motor vehicle on the highways of Louisiana unless it was registered. Violation of &sect; 32:51 was a misdemeanor. Having committed a misdemeanor, defendant was subject to arrest without a warrant. Per La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 228, a search incident to a lawful arrest was allowed for a full-custody arrest reasonably and lawfully made with the purpose of booking the person. The officers were prohibited from issuing defendant a summons in lieu of arrest via La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 211 because the requirements of art. 211(A)(2) were not satisfied as defendant would have continued to drive the vehicle illegally without a vehicle license.</SPAN></P>

The court denied defendant's motion to suppress. The court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the 26th Judicial District Court for the Parish of Webster, Louisiana, which convicted him upon his guilty plea of driving while intoxicated, third offense, and sentenced him to five years at hard labor, six months of which was to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court found that the record showed that the trial court adequately articulated the factors considered in sentencing under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The court noted that defendant had an extensive criminal record, largely involving traffic violations and offenses of driving while intoxicated. Under the facts of defendant's case, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence of five years at hard labor, with six months to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence. The court noted that defendant's continued violation of the drunk driving statute was serious. The court further noted that defendant derived a significant benefit through a favorable plea bargain agreement whereby the charge of driving while intoxicated, fourth offense, was reduced to a charge of driving while intoxicated, third offense. Given those factors, the court found that the sentence was tailored to both the offender and the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The real property owners, lessors, State of Louisiana, and mineral well operators brought claims to obtain the mineral revenues derived from a well which had been drilled on the subject property. The dispute arose because the well had been drilled in a flood plain of the Red River and the river had moved westward over time, which changed the ownership of the surface of the land. Upon consideration of a joint motion for partial summary judgment, the trial court held that the State's lease of the old riverbed did not move westward with the river. The trial court further held that the lessors of property east of the river were in full ownership of the property as the river moved westward under the Freeze Statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. art. 91151. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that the court held that the Freeze Statute was constitutional. The court further upheld the trial court's determination that the State's lease to the riverbed did not move westward with the river.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction of armed robbery contending the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence and the identification; evidence produced at trial was insufficient to support the conviction; the trial judge erred by allowing, the State, over the objections of defense counsel, to introduce evidence ruled inadmissible at the suppression hearing; and the trial judge erred by not considering any mitigating circumstance as mandated by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1, the sentencing guideline. The court affirmed finding that the seizure of the evidence and the subsequent photographic line-up and identification were products of a constitutionally permissible investigatory stop, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress. Testimony by the victim positively identifying defendant in a photographic line-up and at trial as the person who stole her purse was sufficient to support a conviction of armed robbery.

The spouse filed suit alleging that the employer instructed the decedent to perform the work when the employer knew that the structure was not properly braced. The trial court granted summary judgment in the employer's favor. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that conduct that went beyond aggravated negligence, and included such elements as knowingly permitting a hazardous work condition to exist, knowingly ordering claimant to perform an extremely dangerous job, or wilfully failing to furnish a safe place to work fell short of the kind of actual intention to injure that robbed the injury of accidental character. Gross negligence did not meet the test. The evidence in the record showed that the method chosen to erect the rebar cage and form was dangerous and stupid. However, none of the evidence could be interpreted to mean that the supervisory personnel of the employer adopted a procedure that would intentionally cause personal injury. The supervisors did not intend that the form would fall and that the decedent would be killed.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the fee was set by the court, en banc, when it set all other filing fees and that it was not a jury cost because it did not relate to the per diem expenses of the jury, nor did it concern the bond or deposit required to be paid by the party seeking the jury. As such, the court concluded that Rule 5(3) of the Rules of Court for the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans did not violate, nor conflict with, the statutory provisions mandating the jury costs to be assessed under La.

The commissioner prepared a judgment in favor of the employer except to allow the employee a few additional weeks of WC benefits, and assessed the litigation costs against the employee. The trial court immediately signed the judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed except for the cost assessment. Because the employee requested the commissioner to try the case, and because the employee's attorney knowingly and voluntarily signed the waiver, the waiver was valid. Because none of the medical doctors could find any objective evidence that the employee was permanently disabled, the employee did not prove by the clear and convincing evidence required by La. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence, a shirt and socks recovered behind his residence, contending that they were seized incident to a warrantless search. The motion was denied, and following his conviction, defendant appealed. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court concluded that defendant's suppression motion was properly denied. Police were in hot pursuit of defendant and were therefore justified in entering his property to prevent his escape, and an officer was justified in going to the rear of defendant's mobile home to ensure that he did not attempt to flee via the back door. While lawfully in that position, the officer saw a pair of socks and a shirt that matched the description of that worn by the assailant. To prevent destruction of this evidence, the officer was justified in seizing the shirt and socks. The items were in plain view and thus fell within the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. In reversing defendant's sentence, however, the court noted that, where defendant was indigent, it was impermissible to impose a prison term in lieu of payment of a fine that resulted in a term longer than the statutory maximum for the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions were affirmed, but the sentences, which required him to serve excessive jail time in lieu of paying his fines, was reversed and vacated, and a proper sentence was imposed.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was adjudged a third felony habitual offender and sentenced to hard labor for the remainder of his natural life, without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension. On appeal, defendant claimed that the state failed to prove the elements of the charge and that he was erroneously adjudged a multiple offender. The court affirmed the conviction, but found that the lower court erred in sentencing defendant as a Third Felony Habitual Offender. The court reasoned that because the multiple offender bill of information informed defendant only of his prior armed robbery conviction, only that prior conviction could be used for enhancement of the instant offenses.

The auditor argued that the drug tests required by the Rules of Racing, specifically La. Admin.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the Auditor's appeal of his suspension for challenging the mandated daily breathalyzer tests and random urine sample drug tests, the Commission found that the Auditor refused to abide by the rules and regulations set forth by the Racing Commission and the statutes of the State of Louisiana, specifically La.

The Commission upheld the Steward's ruling, revoked the Auditor's license, and denied him all privileges under the jurisdiction of the commission during the period of suspension. The district court upheld the decision of the Commission and dismissed the Auditor's petition, On further appeal, the court concluded that La. Admin.

They arrested the defendant and thereafter posted a &quot;no hunting&quot; sign. The defendant was charged with and convicted of hunting turkey over bait; he appealed his conviction. In affirming, the court concluded that, where the evidence established that the defendant knew the field was a place to hunt, that the defendant was hunting in close proximity to the place where corn was scattered in the field, and that the defendant had guilty knowledge that the field was baited, the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support a conviction. Further, the defendant was not entrapped where the gaming officials did nothing to entice the defendant to violate the law. The agents maintained a completely passive role by observing the field, and their failure to post signs barring hunting upon the baited field until after defendant's arrest did not constitute entrapment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers testified that they noticed defendant walk up to an individual, take money out of his pocket, fold it, and hand it to the individual. The individual handed defendant a small packet containing white powder. The officers then grabbed defendant's hand and found a packet of cocaine in it. The powder tested positive for cocaine. The court found that, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational trier of fact could have easily found the essential elements of possession of cocaine. Defendant also argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress the evidence. Although defendant was not placed under arrest until after the cocaine was seized, the officer approached defendant and forcibly opened his hand to determine whether it contained drugs. The officer saw defendant in a high drug area when he exchanged money for a small packet containing a white substance. The offense was committed in full view of the police. The court therefore concluded that there was probable cause to arrest defendant and the evidence was therefore admissible.</SPAN></P>

The court ordered the appeal transferred to the Louisiana Supreme Court. The Louisiana Supreme Court remanded to the court, stating that the judgment was not appealable to the Louisiana Supreme Court. The court then considered and decided the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Louisiana corporation purchased a tract of land located within the corporate limits of a village. This property was purchased to convert the oil or gas well situated thereon into a commercial saltwater disposal facility. The corporation published the appropriate notices of intention to apply to the commissioner of conservation for a permit to operate a non-hazardous waste disposal facility. The dispute arose because Mermentau Ord. No. 225 (1984) would prohibit the corporation from operating a disposal facility on the property it purchased if it received a permit from the commissioner of conservation. The corporation argued that Ord. No. 225 was unconstitutional as it violated La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 7 (a) (1974) because it was inconsistent with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:1 et seq. In affirming the district court, the court held that the state had preempted the area of regulation embodied by the ordinance. Further, local government bodies were denied the power to adopt local ordinances independently regulating or prohibiting the disposal of oil field waste, both hazardous and non-hazardous. The state agencies had exclusive jurisdiction and control over disposal of the materials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of distribution of cocaine and sentenced to imprisonment at hard labor for seven years. On appeal, the court rejected the contention that the sentence was excessive. The court found that defendant had been convicted at different times for a sex crime and a drug crime, and the court saw no abuse in the trial court's conclusions that he was likely to perpetrate other crimes and that he needed correctional treatment. Regarding the conviction, per the court, there was no error in the trial court's refusal to order that a transcript be made of the previous mistrial of the case. According to the court, the State had to provide an indigent defendant with a transcript of prior proceedings when needed for an effective defense. The court relied in this case on the trial court's having made the day before trial after defense counsel's third request the court reporter's tape available in the reporter's office for defense counsel to listen to before trial and to consult during trial. The court wrote that in most cases the furnishing of the actual transcript was required.</SPAN></P>

One of the defendants was also sentenced to 50 years hard labor for attempted distribution. The sentences were to be without benefit of probation or suspension. On appeal, the court amended the sentence for attempted distribution, and as amended, affirmed. The court held that under La. Rev. Stat.

The court also held that the trial court did not err in allowing the State to challenge jurors who stated that due to the mandatory life sentence involved they could not vote guilty. The court held that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 798 provided for such challenges. The court held that under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 716 et seq. the defense was not entitled to the criminal and personal records of a police witness. The court held that the defense was not entitled to a mistrial when a state witness referred to other crimes committed by defendant because La. Code Crim. Proc.

Defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence, the use of the multiple convictions for sentencing enhancement purposes, and claimed that he was prejudiced by inflammatory closing arguments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of holding his victim against her will and raping her in a motel room. He was then alleged to have threatened her and her family in order to coerce her into meeting him against. Despite evidence about the numerous opportunities that the victim had to escape, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's convictions. Defendant's threats and the victim's fear were offered to explain her failure to escape when she had the chance. The court found that the multiple convictions should have been treated a single conviction for sentencing enhancement purposes pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. Defendant's speedy trial rights were not violated because he was tried within one year of his arrest and he was not prejudiced when he was unable to call a motel employee as a witness because her testimony would have been cumulative. Remarks during closing argument by the prosecutor which indicated that the defense counsel did not take the crime of rape seriously did not warrant a mistrial under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 774 and 775.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction but vacated the sentence imposed on him and remanded for resentencing because the multiple convictions should have been treated as a single conviction because they were entered on the same day.</SPAN></P>

When the trooper ordered defendant out of the car he saw him drop something, which turned out to be a bottle containing crack cocaine. The car was a stolen vehicle and there was drug paraphernalia near defendant's seat. Defendant was convicted of possession of cocaine. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court found no error in the trial court's ruling on the admission of the drug paraphernalia. Though possession of paraphernalia was a crime, the evidence of the other crime was admissible under La. Code Evid. Ann. art. 404(B)(1) because it was an integral part of the act for which defendant was on trial. It was also relevant to show defendant's intent and guilty knowledge in the possession of cocaine. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. The court held that defendant's four-year sentence was not excessive in light of the amount of cocaine he possessed, the fact that he was on probation for a felony, and the fact that he was a regular substance abuser.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Bossier, Louisiana, which convicted him of vehicular homicide under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed a bicyclist when his pickup truck hit the bicyclist who was illegally riding his bicycle against traffic and in the center of defendant's lane of traffic. As a result, defendant was convicted of vehicular manslaughter under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32.1 and was given the maximum sentence of five years at hard labor with two years suspended and a $ 2,000 fine. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction but reversed the sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. Defendant's blood alcohol content was above the legal limit. Because defendant was driving with his headlights off although it was nearly dark and did not see the bicyclist, the evidence was sufficient under the circumstantial evidence rule of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:438 for the jury to find that defendant's alcohol consumption was the cause of the accident. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. Defendant's sentence was excessive in violation of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 (1974) because defendant had no prior convictions, his conduct minimally constituted the offense, and the bicyclist was partly to blame for the accident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was appointed to the position of assistant city attorney. He supported an unsuccessful mayoral candidate and was fired. He was then reinstated but was again discharged after he voiced his opposition to a service charge proposal. Plaintiff filed suit against the mayor, the city attorney, and the city. The mayor and the city attorney filed exceptions of no cause of action and the trial court sustained the exception as to all defendants. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court had the absolute right to determine the existence of a cause of action as to the city under La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 927 even though no exception was filed by the city. Plaintiff's discharge did not violate La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:961 because an assistant city attorney was not an employee as contemplated by &sect; 23:961 but was an appointee with no specific contract of employment, tenure, or term of office. Because the position of assistant city attorney was a policy-making position, plaintiff's right of free speech under La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7 had to yield to defendants' vested interest in maintaining governmental effectiveness and efficiency.</SPAN></P>

After waiving his Miranda rights defendant made inculpatory statements to a police officer who administered a polygraph test. On appeal from defendant's conviction and sentence the court affirmed. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a mistrial on the ground that the prosecutor improperly referred to the unfavorable results of defendant's polygraph test; the first reference to the test was made by defendant himself, prompting the prosecutor to respond to defendant's unsolicited comment that the results of the test were favorable. Furthermore, in light of the strength of the evidence against defendant, the reference to the test was harmless. The 40-year sentence was below the statutory maximum; in light of defendant's status as a fourth offender and likelihood of recidivism, the sentence was not disproportionate. The trial court did not err in allowing into evidence the inculpatory statements made to the officer; defendant was fully advised of his Miranda rights and did not invoke his right to counsel or his right to remain silent.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the funds, some of which were community property and some of which were the husband's separate property were extensively commingled.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An oil company applied for a permit to add and unitize a natural gas well, on a lease basis, as an addition to three adjacent units created by a prior order. The Commissioner granted an allowable which was conditioned upon the oil company's acceptance of a pay out of proceeds from production from the well in compliance with the unit to be created after a hearing. After a public hearing on the matter, the Commissioner issued a new order, which dissolved the previous three geographic units and reconstituted one geologic unit. The oil company appealed the order to the district court contending that the Commissioner did not have authority to issue an order which forced it to share production from a well prior to the effective date of unitization. The trial court affirmed the order and the oil company appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the Commissioner had the authority to condition an allowable on compliance with a unit yet to be created. The court noted that the Commissioner's exercise of his power was proper as long as it was not arbitrary or capricious and that it constituted a modification of the rule of capture and limited the traditional notions of ownership.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The putative father wished to establish paternity to the child born to the mother and her husband during their marriage. Under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 184, the husband was presumed to be the child's father. The putative father sought to use the compulsory blood test statute in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:396 to determine if he was the child's natural father. The trial court refused to compel the mother, her husband, and the child to take the blood tests. The court determined that the putative father had a right to try to establish paternity despite the presumption of legitimacy. It held that to interpret La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 184 so as to impose all the potential obligations associated with parenthood without allowing the biological father some opportunity to assert some parental rights would elevate the presumption from one in the nature of an evidentiary rule, to a substantive rule of law. The court interpreted La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:396 as being applicable in any situation where paternity was a relevant fact.

The administrative board (board) found for the firefighter and the trial court issued a mandamus requiring the city to increase the firefighter's pay level. The city appealed the ruling, arguing that a mandamus could not be issued, the firefighter did not exhaust his grievance procedures and a money judgment could not be sought in a summary proceeding. The court held that the mandamus was properly issued by the trial court, because the city failed to originally appeal from the board ruling, and therefore the trial court could issue a mandamus to enforce its order. The court also determined that the firefighter did not have to exhaust the grievance procedure because it was voluntary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When her husband died, the wife became the executrix of his succession. She relied completely on the advice of her husband's attorneys. The attorneys made financial decisions that depleted the succession's cash and resulted in forced sales or foreclosures of many properties. More than 10 years after most of the transactions took place, the executrix retrieved her files from the attorneys and started investigating the financial dealings. She filed a legal malpractice action against the attorneys and their insurers, which the trial court held was barred by the one-year prescription provided by La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3492. In affirming the trial court's decision, the court held that the prescription did not infringe on the supreme court's jurisdiction in attorney disciplinary matters because it applied to civil suits, not disciplinary actions. Furthermore, the executrix's relationship with the attorneys was terminated more than one year prior to her filing of the malpractice action and the continuing representation rule was not applicable. The suit was untimely even if the prescription was calculated from the executrix's discovery of facts sufficient to state a cause of action.</SPAN></P>

The day before the permanent hearing, the bookstore's counsel requested a continuance, which was denied. The court upheld the grant of the permanent injunction and the denial of the continuance and held that the statute was not unconstitutional because it gave fair notice of what conduct was criminal and what was expected of the premises owner once criminal activity was discovered. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the bookstore's motion for a continuance because there was no indication that the bookstore was going to call any witnesses, and had not advised the court of any testimony or other evidence it planned to submit.

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that &sect; 23:16021 as amended was unconstitutional because it created a classification scheme where one similarly situated class received unequal treatment. Section 23:1601, as amended, provided for a prior-claim requirement. Essentially, individuals that had a prior claim qualified immediately for unemployment benefits where as those that did not had to wait six months. The court determined that the waiting period did not bear a rational relationship to any legislative purpose. The pre-amended statute was applied to the claimant to determine his eligibility.

When police entered the home, the defendant ran into the backyard with an officer in pursuit.

After taking the defendant into custody, the officer searched the shed and found the bag, which contained 20 smaller plastic bags filed with white powder. The defendant was charged with distribution of cocaine, and he appealed the judgment of conviction. In affirming, the court concluded that the district court properly introduced cash found in the house, plastic bags, and a metal strainer into evidence. The evidence was relevant under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:441 because it tended to establish that cocaine distribution was taking place in the house. Further, where the arresting officer had worked in narcotics for five years and had been involved in hundreds of arrests, the majority of which involved packaged cocaine, the district court did not abuse its discretion in qualifying the officer as an expert on the packaging of the drug.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and convicted after selling over one kilogram of cocaine to an undercover narcotics agent. The trial court sentenced defendant to 30 years at hard labor, to be served consecutively to any other sentence defendant was then serving. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction but vacated the sentence. The trial court resentenced defendant to serve 30 years at hard labor, without benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence, but with credit for time served. That sentence was ordered to be served consecutively to a sentence defendant was then serving on a federal conviction. Defendant challenged the resentence. The court amended the decision in part. The court found that at both the sentencing and the re-sentencing, the trial judge clearly articulated his belief that, based on the facts of the case and the large quantity of cocaine involved, defendant was a drug dealer. The trial judge reasoned that defendant's activity as a drug should result in a strict sentence, particularly in light of defendant's previous drug offense. The facts articulated by the trial judge supported the sentence he imposed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court allowed one of the State's witnesses to comment about the girlfriend's allegations that defendant had hit her. The court did not find that the question unduly prejudiced defendant where it actually established a reason why the girlfriend would be angry at defendant and possibly lie. Though the court determined that the trial court erred by allowing testimony about the girlfriend's reputation for peacefulness, it did not require reversal of defendant's conviction. In affirming the conviction, the court would not consider error defendant had raised for the first time on appeal. It affirmed defendant's maximum sentence because it did not find that the trial court had abused its discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted aggravated rape and on appeal argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized by an officer inside his home.

The court amended and affirmed and held that the items seized by the officer fell within the plain view exception. The court amended the sentence to delete the portion that provided that the sentence be served without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence because La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:27(D)(1) did not specifically deny those benefits for persons convicted of attempted offenses. The court held that the sentence of 35 years at hard labor was not unconstitutionally excessive because the sentence fell within the permissible punishment provided under the statute and was not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime and was appropriate when compared to sentences imposed in other cases involving similar circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the application of defendant, the State of Louisiana, through the Department of Transportation and Development, the court granted rehearing for the limited purpose of reconsidering whether an award of general damages was excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After consideration, the court amended its judgment to apply La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:5106(B)(1) retroactively to limit the State's liability for general damages to $ 500,000.00. The court observed that remedial laws such as &sect; 13:5106(B)(1) could be retroactively applied except when such application would operate unconstitutionally to disturb vested rights. The court found that there was no vested right involved. When plaintiffs, an individual and nature tutor of the minor and his son, filed their petition for damages, they possessed a mere expectancy. Judgment was not obtained until 6 years later, whereas &sect; 13:5106(B)(1) became effective 3 years before the judgment was entered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court amended its earlier judgment to affirm the trial court's award of special damages to plaintiff, individually and as nature tutor of the minor, and special damages and future lost earnings to the minor. The court reduced its award for pain and suffering to the minor from $ 3,000,000 to $ 500,000 and reversed the award to the father for consortium related damages.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The debtors challenged the trial court's judgment that granted the creditor's motion for summary judgment in the amount prayed for in its deficiency judgment petitions. The court affirmed and noted the debtors' assertion that a recent state supreme court decision should not have been applied retroactively. The state supreme court held that defects that would have precluded the creditor from the use of executory process no longer precluded the creditor from obtaining a deficiency judgment against a debtor. The court stated that the question was whether the decision applied retroactively to the instant action. The court noted the rationale that statutes that governed the procedure of executory process foreclosure actions were not prohibitory laws, and, therefore, failure to comply with the statutes did not produce an absolute nullity. The court pointed out that the statutes were not prohibitory because the debtor was not prevented from raising any evidentiary defenses. The court held that the debtors would not be deprived of their artificial defenses against a deficiency judgment because they were not a vested right, and could be raised under the Code of Civil Procedure.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:134 and public intimidation, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:122.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was the assistant secretary of the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. Count one alleged that he instructed agents not to issue citations for illegal possession of undersized oysters. Count two alleged that he failed to order those oysters confiscated. Counts three, four, and five alleged that defendant instructed another agent not to prosecute three other citations, and count six alleged public intimidation for threatening to transfer that agent. The court held that counts one and two involved one course of criminal conduct, as did counts three, four, and five, thus count two was properly quashed and three, four, and five were properly consolidated to preclude double jeopardy. The court held that count three was improperly quashed on venue grounds, because the citations involved offenses in Terrebonne parish, but count six was properly quashed because the alleged threat occurred in East Baton Rouge. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:134 was not unconstitutionally vague, as it was readily understandable by a person of reasonable intelligence, and count one properly charged a violation of affirmative duties, expressed in the oath of office and cited statutes.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:961(E), 33:4713 provided that part of the cost of the courts would be paid by local governments. The 21st JDC and the City Judge sought judgment declaring that these acts were unconstitutional, and a writ of mandamus to require the State to provide sufficient funding. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of relief. The court held that the acts were not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, and did not &quot;affect&quot; the courts in violation of La. Const. 1974 art. VI, &sect; 25, which did not preclude a State requirement for local funding. The court rejected equal protection and due process challenges because the 21st JDC and the City Judge were not &quot;persons&quot; protected by those guarantees. The court held that mandamus was not needed because any lack of funding had not interfered with essential court functions, thus did not support invocation of the judiciary's inherent power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a decision revoking a will, the court affirmed. Defendant and the testator lived together and he bequeathed all of his property to her in a statutory will. Subsequently, the testator adopted the 18-year-old grandson of defendant, whom she had raised from birth. Following the testator's death, plaintiffs, claiming to be his children from a marriage that ended in divorce, brought an action against defendant to nullify the will. The district court found that plaintiffs were children of the testator and also held that, since the will made no provision for the subsequently adopted child, it was revoked under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1705. Defendant appealed. The court held that the husband of the mother was presumed to be the father of all children born during the marriage under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 184. The evidence confirmed that plaintiffs were born to their mother during her marriage to the testator. Also, under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 1705, a testament was revoked by the subsequent adoption of a child by the testator. The article's mandate could not be waived. Further, an adopted person of any age was encompassed by the term &quot;child&quot; contained in art. 1705.</SPAN></P>

Ann. art. 1178 allowed for an amended petition where the case had been fully disposed of, plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that they were entitled to attorney's fees. Contrary to plaintiffs' assertions, they were not entitled to such fees under the &quot;common fund&quot; doctrine because plaintiffs' objective for initiating the lawsuit was and remained the elimination of all shell dredging leases in Louisiana.

The court affirmed holding that La. Rev. Stat.

Further the trial court and the board did not commit error in denying the doctor's motion for directed verdict, or more correctly, motion for an involuntary dismissal. There were no such procedural vehicles provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act. There was sufficient evidence presented by the board to show that that the doctor knowingly assisted and aided the veterinarian in the practice of medicine. The testimony clearly showed that the doctor assisted the veterinarian in the practice of medicine and lent his name and licensure status to him. La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a conviction from the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) of attempted possession of 28 grams or more, but less than 200 grams, of cocaine. Defendant also appealed his sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal from a conviction of attempted possession of 28 grams or more, but less than 200 grams of cocaine, the court affirmed the conviction and amended the sentence. Defendant argued that his sentence was excessive and that the sentencing scheme under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(F) was unconstitutional. The appellate court held that the district court specifically considered the La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 guidelines as well as defendant's personal history and past criminal record. The district court had noted defendant's prior conviction of possession of 100 pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute and his 5-year suspended sentence for that offense. Defendant had long been engaged in drug trafficking. After considering defendant's continued criminal activity, the appellate court held that the sentence was not excessive. The court held that it was unconstitutional to subject an indigent defendant to imprisonment because he was unable to pay a fine. A defendant was considered indigent if he was found to be so at any point in the proceedings against him. Accordingly, that portion of the sentence requiring jail time in lieu of payment of the fine was deleted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and amended the sentence. As amended, the decision was affirmed. Defendant's sentence was amended to reduce the fine imposed by the district court and delete that portion of the sentence requiring defendant to serve an additional two years in jail for failure to pay the fine. Insofar as defendant's sentence required him to serve 28 years at hard labor, the sentence was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the claim for wages was timely because it was filed within three years of the time the payments became &quot;exigible,&quot; regardless of whether the date the prescription period commenced was the date the judgment of promotion was rendered or the date the instructor was informed of the judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims, a five year old and a three year old, lived with defendant and their mother. Inappropriate sexual contact was discovered when an uncle reported possible physical abuse. Defendant was charged with various offenses against the two victims. He was thereafter convicted of aggravated oral sexual battery and two counts of sexual battery and sentenced to hard labor. Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences. On review, the court examined issues concerning the sufficiency of the evidence; specifically concerning the elements of age. The court found no error in the introduction of testimony establishing that defendant related his age during the booking process. This was basically because there was no constitutional infraction, but the court noted that other methods introducing age evidence were preferable. Also, there was sufficient evidence of the victims' ages as each victim related their age at the time of the offenses. The court also found that both of the victims were competent to testify. No other reversible error existed. The court also examined the sentences by the trial court with its explanations and found that they were not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a declaratory judgment action, plaintiff worker's compensation claimants sought review of a decision from the 19th Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge (Louisiana), dismissing their claims that the legislature's 1988 amendments to the Worker's Compensation Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1310 et seq., violated La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16, providing for original jurisdiction of worker's compensation appeals in the district courts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants contested the dismissal of their suit seeking a declaration that legislative amendments divesting the state's district courts of jurisdiction to hear appeals from the decisions of administrative worker's compensation panels were unconstitutional. The amendments excluded district courts from the worker's compensation adjudication system by granting aggrieved claimants or employers a direct appeal to the state's circuit courts of appeal. On appeal, the court held that worker's compensation claims were civil matters. Therefore, the amendments contravened La. Const. art. V, &sect; 16(A), which invested the district courts with exclusive original jurisdiction over &quot;all civil matters.&quot; Additionally, the legislature was powerless to change the nature of a worker's compensation claim from a private right to a public right. La. Const. art. V, &sect; 10(B), did not provide for direct review by the circuit courts of appeal of administrative determinations of private rights. The court declined to decide the question of whether judicial review of an administrative agency's determination was an exercise of a district court's original jurisdiction or of its appellate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The consolidated cases concerned a dispute over whether a small portion of property providing entry into the property of plaintiff, was a part of the public roadway. A police jury filed a petition for declaratory judgment to determine the status of the tract in question.

The trial court held that the disputed piece of property was part of the public roadway and issued a permanent injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant accused a boy of stealing and admitted to taking him to a building in order to recover his property. He further admitted threatening the boy and that he grabbed the boy by his pants, which came off when the boy ran away. The boy asserted that defendant tried to rape him. The incident led to a trial by a jury on a charge of attempted aggravated rape but defendant was acquitted. Thereafter, defendant was charged with simple kidnapping and was tried by a jury that found him guilty. Defendant sought review and argued double jeopardy, and that the state should have been estopped from introducing evidence of the attempted rape offense of which he had been acquitted, and that such evidence, when introduced, was prejudicial and deprived him of a fair and impartial trial. On appeal, the court found that the record did not show that the judge ever informed the jury that defendant had been acquitted of attempted aggravated rape. The court determined that the introduction of the evidence of attempted aggravated rape into defendant's trial on the charge of simple kidnapping was fundamentally unfair. The court concluded that defendant accordingly was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>

After the parties split up, the victim accused defendant of making out his pre-signed checks for more than the purchase amount or making out the checks to herself and cashing them, all without the victim's authorization. Defendant was not accused of forging the checks. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was insufficient to support an attempted theft conviction. The State failed to establish that defendant had the specific intent to permanently deprive the victim or misappropriate his funds without his consent. The victim admitted that he freely gave defendant pre-signed blank checks for household use, that they had lived in a marriage-like relationship, and that he never filed a complaint until they had parted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbing two food stores on consecutive evenings. Both store cashiers described defendant except for his face, which was covered by a red ski mask. A high-speed chase ensued after the second robbery. Defendant bailed out of the getaway car, ran between police cars, and escaped. However, police nabbed the driver and in the car found a red ski mask. When defendant was arrested three weeks later for a different offense, the officer who saw him during the high-speed chase recognized him. On appeal, the court held that defendant's inculpatory statements were admissible because defendant's story that police had brutalized him during questioning at the police station was not corroborated. The pursuing officer's identification was reliable because his attention was sharply focused on defendant during his escape from the getaway car. A gun found in a park near defendant's escape route was admissible even though no direct evidence tied defendant to the gun. Defendant's sentence was not excessive even though his co-defendant was sentenced to only five years in prison on both counts because due process did not mandate sentencing parity for co-defendants.</SPAN></P>

Among the conditions imposed was $ 25,000 restitution to the victim's family, subject to a credit for the proceeds paid by defendant's insurer. On appeal, defendant contended that the sentence was excessive. In affirming defendant's sentence, the court found that the death of the victim was, of itself, sufficient basis for the award of $ 25,000, without the requirement of an evidentiary hearing. The court found no patent errors on the record and affirmed the conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife's claims were brought under general maritime law, the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.S. &sect; 688, and Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U.S.C.S. &sect; 761. The employer and the wife appealed the award of damages and the court affirmed the judgment in part and reversed in part. The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding of unseaworthiness and Jones Act liability based on an inattentive and neglectful crew. The court affirmed the judgment that decedent was five percent at fault because there was no evidence to show that the jury's finding was clearly wrong. Punitive damages were not warranted because there was no evidence to suggest that the employer and owner of the vessel was grossly negligent or that it acted in bad faith. The award of damages for pain and suffering were not excessive considering that the decedent lived for several hours after his injury and that his injuries were painful. In addition, the decedent was treated in a foreign land and was not administered sufficient pain medication. Finally, the court held that prejudgment interest was not appropriate because the employer was found liable under the Jones Act and general maritime law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another codefendant in his trial, both raped a woman.

He further claimed that &sect; 14:42, was unconstitutionally vague, that the mandatory penalty provided upon conviction of &sect; 14:42 was unconstitutional, that the jury was improperly selected, and that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of aggravated rape. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment on the grounds that &sect; 14:42 was not unconstitutionally vague because the definition of participate found in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:42(A)(5),(B)(2) offered a clear and definite standard of conduct. The court held that defendant's trial was properly not severed because defendants failed to show any evidence of actual antagonism or prejudice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of distribution of a controlled Schedule I substance, namely marijuana, in violation of La.

He appealed, claiming that the trial court erred in denying his motion for continuance, that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the verdict, and that his sentence of 15 years at hard labor was illegally excessive. The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court found that defendant had failed to make the necessary showing under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 709 for a continuance. He failed to present facts to which the absent witness was expected to testify, fact and circumstances showing a probability that the witness would be available if the case were continued, and facts showing due diligence used to procure the attendance of the witnesses. The officer's testimony as to his observations of defendant's criminal conduct was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was guilty. The court further held that the sentencing guidelines of La. Code Crim. Proc.

Thereafter, an insurance company bond was substituted for the construction company's lien. The lender thus obtained the first mortgage position after the recorder of mortgages cancelled the lien and filed the bond under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9:4835. When the new owner defaulted, the lender filed suit to foreclose. The construction company intervened, arguing that, since the insurance company had become insolvent, it was entitled to have its cancelled lien reactivated and deemed superior. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the lender, and the construction company appealed. In affirming, the court concluded that the civil code articles on erasure of mortgages, La.
