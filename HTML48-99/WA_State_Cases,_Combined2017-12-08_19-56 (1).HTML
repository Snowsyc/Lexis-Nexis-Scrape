<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A motel manager left her apartment to run an errand. As she was returning, she saw a woman sitting in a car parked by the motel office. The woman told the manager her husband was looking for someone from whom to rent a unit. As the manager continued to her apartment, she met defendant, who was waling by her door. He rented a room and drove off with the woman. The manager went to her apartment and found that it had been forcibly entered and items had been stolen. The man and woman registered at another motel and the manager's stolen property was found there when the man and woman left. On appeal, the court found that the instruction on the statutory presumption of criminal intent was proper because the instruction did not shift the burden of proof and only referred to the absence of satisfactory evidence generally and not to the silence of defendant. In addition, the instruction on aiding and abetting was properly given because there was proof that someone else could have committed the offense because the woman was in the car in which the stolen property was probably transported and she occupied the motel room in which the property was found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant corporation challenged a decision from the Superior Court of Lewis County, Washington, which entered summary judgment in favor of respondent State. The State filed the action to abate a public nuisance and to obtain a mandatory injunction directing the corporation to remove certain advertising signs next to a highway.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State's petition alleged that defendant maintained five signs in violation of the Highway Advertising Control Act of 1961, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.42 (amend.). One of the five signs was alleged to be within a &quot;protected area,&quot; as defined in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.42.020(6). The remaining four signs exceeded the 150 square feet area maximum permitted by the Highway Commission's regulations under Wash. Admin. Code &sect; 252-40-020(11) (1961). The court found that the State carried its burden of producing evidence that the corporation's signs were unlawful. The corporation's affidavit in opposition to the State's summary judgment motion related solely to valuation and compensation and did not put in issue any material fact relating to the signs' size or location. Moreover, the Scenic Vistas Act of 1971 was a legislative exercise of the police power even more relevant to traffic safety purposes than was the 1961 Act. Finally, the corporation was not entitled to compensation for the removal of the signs. Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 47.42.102(3) did not violate the corporation's equal protection rights because the disfavored class owned illegal signs while the favored class owned legal signs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The creditor brought an action against the debtor to recover unpaid rent. Concurrently she obtained an order directing the debtor to show cause why a writ of attachment should not issue directing the county sheriff to attach all of her property within the county. An affidavit submitted by the creditor showed compliance with Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.12 to justify issuance of the writ, and the trial court, after a hearing on affidavits, entered an order authorizing the issuance of the writ. The debtor contended that the attachment authorized by &sect; 7.12 violated due process because it contained no provision for notice and judicial hearing before the writ issued to determine whether the creditor's claim was probably valid. The court held that where in this instance the order of the trial court omitted from the reasons stated that the creditor's claim was probably valid, the writ could not have been upheld and violated the debtor's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that his detention by the police while a warrants check was being made, which resulted in his arrest and search, was illegal because the police stopped him without any reasonable basis to support a belief that he was committing, or was aiding or abetting another in committing, a crime. The trial judge denied the motion and found that defendant was aiding and abetting his friend in the commission of a misdemeanor, hitchhiking, in the presence of the police officers. The court agreed. The police officers had probable cause to stop defendant and his friend, and it was a proper and reasonable procedure under the circumstances for police to run a warrants check so long as the time involved in so doing was reasonable and the invasion of privacy minimal. The police officers were justified in believing that defendant was overtly engaged in a joint effort with his friend to solicit a ride, which violated Wash. Rev. Code ch. 9.01.030. Defendant admitted knowing his friend and was walking with the friend, who was soliciting a ride. There was probable cause for the police to believe that defendant was aiding and abetting his friend in the solicitation of a ride.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, one count of attempted rape, two counts of rape, and one count of second-degree assault. Defendant pled guilty to one count and was sentenced to life imprisonment on that count. The trial court entered an order declaring defendant to be a sexual psychopath, making him ineligible for parole. Defendant pled guilty to another count and was convicted of the murder charges and the remaining counts. The trial court sentenced defendant to death on the first-degree murder counts and imposed sentences for the other crimes. The United States Supreme Court later invalidated the death penalty. On September 7, 1972, the trial court entered an order modifying the September 26, 1969 judgment and sentence by eliminating the death penalty and substituting a penalty of life imprisonment on each murder count. On September 12, 1972, the trial court set aside the finding that defendant was a sexual psychopath based on the parties' agreement. The court held that the trial court did not have statutory authority to enter the order of September 12, 1972, but the sentence of September 7, 1972 was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants were declared habitual offenders and had their driving privileges revoked for five years. In affirming the trial court's order on appeal, the court found that defendants' additional violations, incurred after the Act became effective, qualified them for license revocation. The court stated that at the time the Act became effective defendants were not within the definition of a habitual offender. However, the court noted that after the Act became effective, defendants received additional traffic violations that subjected them to being habitual offenders. The court concluded that the Act did not impair any of defendants' vested rights, place any duty, or place any disability on defendants regarding transactions that already occurred. The court determined that the Act was constitutional because the state had a right to regulate any activity to protect life, health, or property. The court also found that the Act did not violate defendants' due process rights because it provided adequate hearing procedures. The court noted that the abstract records kept by the motor vehicle department were public record and had been duly certified, which made them admissible into evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant questioned whether the State's evidence was sufficient to prove the charge because no evidence was introduced to prove that his failure to provide necessities was willful. No evidence was introduced on the question of whether defendant had any income or jobs between the relevant dates, or whether he was capable of working during the period. The court found no error. The State proved that the accused was the father of minor children under the age of 16 years, and that he furnished a total of $ 235 for food, clothing, shelter, and medical attendance for those children during the charging period. When the State proved the obligation to support and the failure to discharge that obligation, the statutory presumption set out in Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.20.080 established prima facie willfulness. The court noted that the presumption of willfulness was rebuttable. Proof that the accused was physically and vocationally unable to work could have been introduced to rebut the presumption.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, a sauna parlor masseuse, was arrested for vagrancy after allegedly massaging a male customer's genital area. Defendant challenged her conviction, and the court affirmed, but remanded for resentencing. The court held that the vagrancy statute, &sect; 9.87.010(7), was not unconstitutional because it gave proper notice of what type of conduct was prohibited, and it was clear that defendant understood the impropriety of her conduct. Further, merely because defendant's actions took place behind a closed door in a business establishment open to the public did not make those acts any less public. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, and it was not error to refuse defendant's requested instruction where the instruction given met minimum requirements. However, the statute expressly provided for a maximum penalty of six months in jail, and thus the trial court's sentence of one year in jail was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was charged with possession of cocaine and LSD. Neither he nor his attorney understood the meaning of the mandatory minimum provisions of the charging statutes. Counsel advised the inmate that if he was not placed on probation he would probably serve about 18 months in prison. At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge relied on defense counsel to have advised the inmate of the impact of his guilty plea, and only admonished him that he would be liable to confinement &quot;for a period of years.&quot; The inmate pleaded guilty to both counts and was sentenced to 5 to 20 years on the cocaine count and up to 10 years on the LSD count. The inmate sought habeas corpus relief. After an evidentiary hearing by the superior court, the court granted habeas relief to the inmate. The court held that the inmate's guilty plea was not voluntary because it was not made with full knowledge of its consequences. His attorney's advice was erroneous and misleading and the trial judge's admonition that imprisonment would be for a &quot;term of years&quot; was not a satisfactory explanation.

On appeal, he claimed that the trial court instructed the jury in error regarding the M'Naghten rule. He also claimed that the custodial interrogation by the psychiatrist was in violation of his right to the assistance of counsel for his defense at a critical stage of the prosecution as guaranteed him by U.S. Const. amend VI. The court affirmed his conviction. The court held that the M'Naghten rule was the proper standard for pleas of insanity and that other irresistible impulse definitions did not meet the standard of insanity in Washington. Therefore, the instruction was proper. The court also held that the State met its heavy Miranda burden of proving that defendant understood and that he voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his constitutional right to be represented by counsel at the psychiatric interview.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed rejecting the association's claim that the board was improperly organized because the declaratory judgment action was not the proper vehicle for challenging the selection of board members, and the actions of de facto members were immune from collateral attack. The board had the authority to promulgate rules and regulations pertaining to private sewage disposal because, liberally construed, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 70.05.060 related to &quot;sanitary&quot; measures as &quot;health&quot; measures. The resolutions were not unconstitutional because Wash. Const. art. 11, &sect; 11 did not divest the legislature of its inherent police power, nor does it restrict the legislature in delegating its power. Such delegation was circumscribed by guiding standards but left the details to be determined by the board.

The court granted the lessee a writ of certiorari to review the order of the Superior Court of Douglas County (Washington), which denied the lessee's motion to quash a temporary restraining order and motion for a change of venue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lessor procured an ex parte temporary restraining order that enjoined the lessee from removing harvested products or equipment from the leased premises. In its review on certiorari, the court held that the issuance of the restraining order prior to a hearing deprived the lessee of a significant property right without the procedural due process of law. Although the lessor had alleged irreparable injury, the complaint asked for nothing that could not be reduced to a money judgment. Thus, the court held that the lessor failed to allege an emergency that justified the issuance of a temporary restraining order pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.40.050. The court also concluded that venue was improperly based upon Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.12.010, which provided for venue in the county of the subject property for actions claiming injury to real property. Because the lessor's action was for the breach of a contract, the lease, the court held that the lessee was entitled to a change of venue to the county where he resided pursuant to Wash. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss the State's delinquency petition. The motion alleged that &sect; 13.04.010 was unconstitutional because it delegated of executive authority to the judiciary. The motion also argued that the county juvenile court's financing system denied petitioner the same probation and court services that juveniles residing in other counties received. The motion argued that because probation personnel had been allowed to be involved in the investigatory and adjudicatory phases, petitioner was deprived of due process. The trial court held a fact-finding hearing and adjudged petitioner delinquent. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Petitioner had standing to contest the constitutionality of &sect; 13.04.010 because the adjudication that she was delinquent under &sect; 13.04.010 showed the requisite harm. It was not shown that the per capita amount spent on probation in nine Washington counties bore on the amount spent on probation per child. Therefore, petitioner's financing system argument failed. Section 13.04.010 bore a rational relation to its stated purpose to aid juveniles and it applied equally to those included in the class it designated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the amended information failed to expressly provide that one who committed a rape was guilty of unlawful or felonious conduct. The court found that the failure to call the specified acts a crime did not in the least militate against the acts being in law criminal when they were clearly defined and punishment for them was clearly prescribed. Because the rape statutory language was clear, unambiguous, and grammatically correct, the statute defined a crime. The rape statute set forth with particularity the acts that constituted rape and provided criminal penalties for perpetrators. The identification of defendant at a pretrial line up which defendant's attorney did not attend was properly admitted because the federal lineup rules were created after defendant's trial, and the rules were prospective and not retrospective. Furthermore, defendant could not show any prejudice as a result of the identification testimony being admitted. The State could use military convictions to impeach defendant's testimony because there were no exceptions to the statute allowing for the use of prior convictions for impeachment purposes.</SPAN></P>

While there, he objected to following the required procedures. After leaving the office in an angry fashion, defendant returned within a half-hour. Upon his return, he shot the supervisor. He then left the building and twice shot at police. In a second encounter with police, he pointed the gun at an officer but did not shoot. Defendant appealed his four convictions for first-degree assault. The court affirmed defendant's convictions for his assault upon the supervisor and the first two police officers. The court found that defendant's actions in those instances clearly showed that defendant had the intent to kill. However, the giving of a jury charge instructing the jury that it was permitted to infer a specific intent to kill solely from the fact that defendant was armed with an unlicensed pistol was reversible error. It could not have been said with substantial assurance that the presumed fact, a specific intent to kill, would more likely than not, have flown from the fact that defendant was in possession of an unlicensed pistol.</SPAN></P>

Pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.92.060, the trial court granted a suspended sentence and required defendants, as a condition, to pay restitution to the victim. Defendants appealed and asserted that the trial court had abused its discretion by including, in its restitution order, an amount for the victim's pain and suffering.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">As a condition for suspending defendants' sentences, the trial court ordered them to pay restitution for the victim's medical expenses, lost wages, and the pain and suffering he had endured as a result of the assault. Defendants appealed and asserted that although &sect; 9.92.060 allowed the trial court to order them to pay restitution, it had abused its discretion by assessing an amount for the victim's pain and suffering and including that amount in its restitution order. The court found no abuse of discretion. The restitution ordered by the trial court was for the &quot;loss or damage&quot; sustained by the victim as a direct consequence of defendants' crime. The ordered payments thus bore a reasonable relation to defendants' duty to make reparations. The conditions imposed were consistent with the provisions of &sect; 9.92.060 and within the discretionary powers of the trial court.

Rev. Code &sect; 9.27.010. Three defendants were also convicted of participation in an &quot;unlawful assembly,&quot; in violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.27.060.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants' convictions arose from two incidents of &quot;unlawful assembly,&quot; which occurred in the vicinity of a Native American encampment. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions of all but one defendant. The court held that the trial court did abuse its discretion granting the State's pretrial motion to add the charge of unlawful assembly to the existing failure to disperse charge because defendants failed to show that they were prejudiced in their ability to defend against the unlawful assembly charge. The court found no express exception for innocent bystanders in Wash Rev. Code &sect; 9.27.070. Three defendants were observed at the first incident and the repeated warning to disperse was loud enough for them to hear, but they did not do so. However, one defendant was entitled to a dismissal of the failure to disperse charge because he arrived at the place of the unlawful meeting after the warning was given and there was no evidence that he knew such a warning had been given. Finally, the court held that neither &sect; 9.27.070 nor Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.27.060 violated the First Amendment right of peaceable assembly or the right of free speech.</SPAN></P>

The owners urged that the trial court had erred. The State claimed that a new gambling code, 1971 Wash. Laws 280, had mooted the issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State, on the relation of the governor and attorney general, sought a declaratory judgment to determine whether certain bingo-type pinball machines owned and managed by the owners were gambling devices and whether their operation constituted a lottery. The trial court declared that the machines were gambling devices, whose operation constituted a lottery, and enjoined the owners from owning or managing them. When the owners appealed, the court dismissed the appeal as moot. It explained that the issues became moot when the legislature repealed or substantially amended all of the statutes upon which the declaratory judgment and injunction had been based. As the relevant statutes had been superseded by a new and comprehensive plan, under 1971 Wash. Laws 280, which answered the questions raised in the appeal and clearly granted the relief sought by the State, the court found no reason to apply the continuing and substantial public interest exception to the general rule that appellate courts would not pass upon moot questions. The court suggested that the owners could seek relief from the judgment under Wash. Super. Ct. Civ. R. 60(b)(6), (11), (c).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court for King County (Washington) convicting him of credit card or identification card theft, which was a violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.26A.030. All of defendant's assignments of error on appeal were based on the single argument that &sect; 9.26A.030 was unconstitutional because of the presumption contained in the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court noted that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.26A.030 provided that when a person not an issuer or agent thereof had in his possession or under his control credit cards or identification cards issued in the names of two or more other persons he was presumed to have violated Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.26A.030(1) or Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.26A.030(2). The court found that the presumption established by &sect; 9.26A.030 was a rebuttable one. It permitted, but did not require, the trier of fact to find the presumed fact given the existence of the proven fact. The court noted that the validity of such a presumption depended upon whether there was a rational connection between the fact which was proven and the fact which was presumed from the proven fact. The required rational connection did not exist unless it was possible to say with substantial assurance that the presumed fact was more likely than not to flow from the proven fact on which it was made to depend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The creditor claimed that he had contracted with the debtor to repair the debtor's car. The county clerk issued a writ of attachment and the sheriff took possession of the car after the creditor complied with the requirements of Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 7.12.020, 7.12.060. The trial court dismissed the writ of attachment. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that the debtor had been denied a significant property interest, the possession of his car, through a summary administrative proceeding in which he had no part, which was contrary to U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Wash. Const. art. 1, &sect; 3. The court noted that the prejudgment seizure of the debtor's car took place without notice or hearing. The court determined that the fact that the debtor could regain possession by acceding to the monetary demands of the creditor or by posting a redelivery bond pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 7.12.250 did not alter the character of the deprivation. The court indicated that the United States Supreme Court had previously held that the common practice of prejudgment seizure of a debtor's property without notice or hearing was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State adjudicated two children as dependent children and incorrigible, and they were committed. The court reviewed the actions by writ of certiorari. As to the first child, the court held that the issue was moot because she was over 18 years old. As to the second child, the court affirmed the finding of incorrigibility. The court reasoned that there was substantial evidence that the child, in direct disobedience of her foster parents, failed regularly to attend school classes, used dangerous drugs, and did not inform her foster parents of her whereabouts. Her disobedience established that she was out of her foster parents' control or incorrigible. The court also determined that Wash. Rev. Code &sect;&sect; 13.04.010(2), 13.04.04.010(7), 13.04.095(6), the statutes by which the child was committed, were not unconstitutionally vague or arbitrarily applied. The court reasoned that children of ordinary understanding knew that they had to obey their parents or those persons lawfully standing in a parent's place. Therefore, the phrase &quot;beyond the control and power of his parents&quot; gave fair notice to the child of a pattern of behavior that might have caused her to be considered incorrigible.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Code &sect; 69.33. He urged that a case law interpretation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.33.220(13) (amended 1969) applied to his sentence revocation proceeding held after the effective date of the statutory amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on a guilty plea of illegal possession of marijuana and received a suspended sentence. He was later arrested for violating his suspended sentence. In the interim Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.33.220(3) (amended 1969) was enacted, removing cannabis from the scope of the Act. The court had interpreted the amended statute as not applying to proceedings that were at the prosecution stage or appeal stage as of the effective date of the amendment. Defendant filed a motion to vacate his conviction, urging the trial court to enlarge the statutory interpretation to include proceedings that had resulted in a suspended sentence. The trial court denied his motion, and he appealed. The court affirmed, explaining that in all of the cases in which the interpretive decision was applied to effect a dismissal, the cases had been either in the prosecution stage or pending appeal as of the effective date of the amendment. The court had limited the retroactivity of the case to &quot;pending&quot; actions and found no basis for extending the definition of a &quot;pending&quot; case to someone under a disability of a suspended sentence. A suspended sentence was a final judgment that ended a prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants participated in a draft-card-turn-in demonstration in the city park. They were arrested and charged with the violating the portion of Tacoma, Wash., Ordinance 8.44.065, which made it a misdemeanor to willfully go upon designated public property with the intent to commit an unlawful act. After they were convicted, they contended on appeal that the ordinance was unconstitutional and unlawful, and that their behavior was not violative of the ordinance. On review, the court upheld the ordinance and the convictions. The court held that the ordinance was a reasonable exercise of the city's police power because it acted as a safeguard of public property and preservation of the public peace, which design was reasonable and necessary to the peace, safety, and welfare of the public. Further, the court held that the actions of the male defendants violated 50 U.S.C.S. App. &sect; 462(b)(6) of the Selective Service Act of 1967, while the actions of the female defendants violated 50 U.S.C.S. &sect; 462(a)(6) as aiders and abettors.

They also asked that the trial court order defendants to cease and desist from the practices complained of and that defendants submit a plan to implement the judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers alleged that the criminal law enforcement officials of King County, Wash., and the City of Seattle, Wash., were engaged in a deliberate, continuing, and on-going practice of holding persons arrested without warrants on &quot;open-charge&quot; or &quot;suspicion&quot; bookings for unreasonable lengths of time. They claimed that such a practice was illegal and unconstitutional and that the illegal acts necessarily involved the illegal expenditure of public funds in the payment of salaries and the operating costs of the city and county jails and were therefore a direct, definite, increasing and on-going tax burden. The trial court concluded that the taxpayers lacked standing to prosecute the action. The court did not reach the question of standing. The court held that the judiciary did not have the power to directly supervise law enforcement officers. It was not the impracticability of the taxpayers' proposed remedy, but rather its constitutional infirmity that required affirmance. The establishment of three co-equal branches of government -- executive, legislative, and judicial -- and the allocation of power among them, was the essence of the American system of government.</SPAN></P>

The residents brought an action challenging the city council's jurisdiction to proceed and seeking a restraining order and an order to show cause. The residents also claimed that Wash. Rev.

Rev. Code &sect; 82.04.050), by respondent Washington State Department of Revenue to manufactured products furnished by respondent taxpayer in connection with a highway construction project. The taxpayer filed a cross-appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer contracted with the Department of Highways to construct a bridge. A significant portion of the project required the manufacture of concrete pontoons. The taxpayer and the Department of Highways failed to agree on the terms for a revision of the project. The contract was awarded to a contractor, but a contract was awarded to the taxpayer for manufacture of the pontoons. The Department of Highways took possession and had the new contractor move and install the pontoons. The Department of Revenue assessed taxes against the taxpayer, and, after the taxpayer protested, assessed a sales tax on the pontoons with the taxpayer as the seller and the Department of Highways as the buyer. The Department of Revenue affirmed its amended assessment and assessed audit interest. The lower court found that the Department of Highways owed the amount of the tax to the taxpayer, which had paid the tax, found that the taxpayer owed audit interest to the Department of Revenue, and found that the Department of Highways owed that amount to the taxpayer. The court held that the Department of Highways was ultimately responsible for payment of the sales tax and audit interest as the buyer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When he was arrested while fleeing his home after espying men searching it, defendant had on his person a small coin purse that contained the blue tablets, with another such tablet in his wallet, which were discovered to be numorphan. Substantiating defendant's claim that the tablets were part of a prescription that had been ordered for his wife, the wife's physician and the druggist who filled the prescription testified in defendant's behalf. However, in challenging defendant's account that he retained the tablets so that his wife could not mix them with the alcohol she regularly consumed, the prosecutor repeatedly referred in his closing argument to the failure of the wife to testify. Finding that Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 5.60.060 prohibited a wife from testifying against her husband, the court held that no inference of guilt could thereby arise from the wife's failure to testify. Further, the court noted that if an appropriate pretrial motion to suppress was made during the new trial, the trial court could consider the fact that defendant fled his home during the lawful search in considering whether the narcotic found in his possession was admissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment entered by the trial court and remanded the cause, ordering the trial court to grant defendant a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was walking rather than jogging on a city street, as was his usual custom. He was in a residential district a short distance from his home when he came into contact with a police officer. The officer asked defendant to explain his presence at that time and place and to show identification. The officer informed defendant that he was required to produce identification and to answer questions. Defendant declined on the ground that he did not believe the officer had a right to require defendant to verbally respond or produce identification. After defendant returned to his home, he was arrested for violation of the city ordinance. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance under the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The court held that if a criminal sanction was to be imposed, the Fourteenth Amendment required much more certainty and specificity than the ordinance provided and that such certainty was essential both to inform the public officer of the scope of his powers and to inform the citizen of what was expected of him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city deposited sewage from a treatment plant into certain waterways used by the landowners for farm irrigation purposes. The trial court believed that there was insufficient evidence to allow a jury to apply the proper measure of damages and that the landowners' claims were barred because of more than 10 years of adverse use of, or interference with, their property rights by the city. On review, the court reversed and remanded. The court found that there was clearly established a prima facie case of an inverse condemnation in the nature of a taking, damages could have been measured as the decline in market value at the time of trial, and there was sufficient evidence to create an issue of fact for the jury. The court determined that the jury should have been allowed to make a factual determination under instructions to the effect that, to recover, the landowners had to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the damage to their property had, within 10 years prior to the commencement of the action, differed substantially in kind or was substantially greater in degree than it had been prior to the commencement of that period.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court for Franklin County, Washington, which convicted him of possession of marijuana while in a county jail, a violation of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.40.061. Defendant had been previously convicted of the illegal sale and possession of a dangerous drug and was engaged in a work release program from the jail when he was charged with the offense of marijuana possession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On defendant's previous conviction for illegal sale and possession, he was sentenced to one year's imprisonment, with nine months suspended if he successfully completed the work-release program. Under the program, defendant left the county jail to go to his job and returned there after work. A deputy observed defendant crouching near a trash box. Upon investigation, he discovered marijuana in the trash box. Defendant was charged with possession of marijuana while in jail. The trial court appointed a public defender. At trial, defendant indicated that he wished to represent himself. The trial judge encouraged defendant to accept counsel but allowed him to proceed, with the public defender present. Defendant was convicted and appealed. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court had abused its discretion in allowing him to represent himself. Under the totality of the circumstances, defendant had intelligently and voluntarily waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Section 69.40.061 was constitutional because Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 69.40.070, which fixed harsher penalties for successive convictions, was a penalty statute and not part of the crime of possession.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner, the State of Washington, filed for a writ of certiorari to review a judgment of the Superior Court for Pierce County, Washington, which denied the State an order that adjudicated public use and necessity to a strip of land in Pierce County. The State sought initially to condemn part of a tract for the purpose of constructing a diamond interchange on a State Route. The order was granted for all land except the narrow disputed strip.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the hearing on public use and necessity, respondent property owners objected to condemnation of the narrow strip, claiming that it would be an unconstitutional condemnation for a private purpose and that the change in plans had demonstrated that the strip was not needed for the interchange development. The trial court agreed with this contention and denied condemnation pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 8.04.070, finding that the sole purpose for taking the strip was for a private interest, namely, to act as a screen for subdivision residents who had complained to the State. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. There was substantial evidence that the disputed strip was intended solely for the purpose of screening a few private property owners from the highway and power line. Such use would normally constitute a public use in the constitutional sense. However, under the unique facts of this case, a large section of the proposed green belt was separated from the highway by the shopping center. Thus, the proposed green belt would result in a benefit to four or five private property owners, with very little, if any, benefit to users of the highway.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that &sect; 9.86.020(1), (2) violated his U.S. Const. amend. I rights. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment of conviction with directions to dismiss the charge. The court held that &sect; 9.86.020(1), (2) was invalid as unconstitutionally overbroad on its face. The court determined the statutory prohibition of the act of affixing a peace symbol to the American flag and displaying the flag with the peace symbol so affixed from a window was not constitutionally permissible as protection of a societal or governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression. The court found that the case illustrated overbreadth on the face of &sect; 9.86.020(1), (2), not only with respect to the American flag itself, but also with respect to the items included in the statutory definition of the flag.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff filed a personal injury action against the residents and one non-resident, over which personal jurisdiction was properly obtained. Although plaintiff prevailed on his claims against the residents, he did not prevail as to the non-resident. The non-resident filed a motion for costs, which included a request for reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 4.28.185. The lower court granted the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that plaintiff failed to meet his burden of showing that &sect; 4.28.185 made an unconstitutional classification by allowing the recoverability of prevailing non-residents, but not prevailing residents. The distinction was not manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, inequitable, or unjust. That was so because non-residents generally incurred greater expenses and has a greater burden generally in defending an action in a foreign jurisdiction. The classification based on residency, which was otherwise reasonable, did not per se violate the state or federal constitution by allowing the recovery of attorneys' fees by the prevailing non-resident.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction by challenging the constitutionality of Seattle, Wash., Ordinance 16046, &sect; 1 on several theories. The court ruled that the Ordinance was not void for vagueness because it adequately described what conduct was proscribed. The court also ruled that Ordinance 16046 was not unconstitutional because it abridged free speech in that the right of free speech failed to embrace words likely to produce violence in others. The court also determined that it was unable to review the challenged findings of fact under Wash. Ct. App. R.

The sentence was later amended by reducing the amount of solitary confinement to three months defendant had already served and removing the condition of banishment. After defendant was convicted of forgery, the suspended sentence was revoked. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the revocation of the suspended sentence was not invalid on the ground that the original sentence was an illegal and unconstitutional sentence because the sentence was modified to remove the onerous conditions imposed by the original sentence and the penalty actually served by defendant prior to the modification hearings was not so excessive as to require the court to set aside the conviction; and (2) the trial court did not err in revoking defendant's probation because defendant was accorded his due process and fair procedure right and substantial evidence supported the discretionary act of revocation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that based upon the evidence, defendant was presumed to have acted wilfully under Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 26.20.080 and entered a conviction against him. On appeal, defendant challenged the constitutionality of the presumption embodied in &sect; 26.20.080. The court ruled that the acts of the legislature were presumed constitutional and that the legislative exercise of power was constitutional in the instant matter because it was protective of the important interest of providing for support of children by their parents, rather than by the public. The court ruled that the application of the presumption in the instant matter also must have been upheld because it flowed from a proven fact in that defendant was shown to have earned substantial wages at one job, but he paid little or nothing toward the support of his children.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, finding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by limiting cross-examination of the juvenile eyewitness as to his juvenile court involvement because the judge concluded that no prejudice would result from its exclusion based on the collateral nature of the proposed cross-examination. The judge's admonition to the juvenile witness was intended to insure that the boy understood questions put to him and was not an unconstitutional comment on the evidence. There was substantial evidence to permit a finding that the shooting of the victim and the taking of his property were parts of the same transaction. The fact that the homicide preceded the final act of the robbery did not fragment the transaction so as to bring it out of the felony murder rule. The issue of premeditated murder was properly submitted even if the premeditation was instantaneous. The State's inadvertent failure to furnish the last page of the ballistics report did not warrant a mistrial because the ballistics evidence was excluded in its entirety. Rehabilitative testimony did not have to be limited to that of the witness himself.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was originally found guilty of burglary in the second degree, and the trial court entered an order deferring imposition of sentence for a period of three years on certain conditions. Later, a revocation hearing was held where counsel represented defendant. The order deferring sentence was revoked, and defendant was sentenced to prison. New counsel was appointed for defendant, and defendant appealed the revocation and sentence. Defense counsel filed a motion to withdraw from the case because there was no error and the appeal was wholly frivolous. The State filed a motion to dismiss the appeal as frivolous. The court determined that the record did not show any error that arguably supported the appeal. The second-degree burglary statute, Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.19.020, was a proper exercise of the police power, and no violation of any constitutional guarantees appears on the face of the statute. The information charged the offense in the language of the statute and was sufficiently definite to apprise defendant of the charges against him. Defendant's guilty plea was voluntary. Furthermore, the revocation order came after defendant was fully represented at a hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Act made no mention of benevolent or charitable organizations, and before an organization that was not operated for profit or pecuniary gain could be required to pay industrial insurance or medical aid premiums, it had to come within the language of the Act. In view of its holding, the trial court found it unnecessary to address the employer's assertion that the claimant was not entitled to benefits because he was employed at an &quot;apartment house&quot; under Wash.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant testified that he drank for several hours, smoked marijuana, and involuntarily consumed LSD. He blacked out for five hours, during which time the crimes he was charged with were committed. The trial court instructed the jury that voluntary intoxication was not a defense, but that intoxication could be considered as to requisite criminal intent. By its guilty verdict, the jury impliedly rejected defendant's plea of temporarily insanity or mental irresponsibility. The trial court denied his motion for new trial and imposed sentence. Defendant appealed. The court held that the jury had not perceived any unlawful comments. Defendant failed to object or request a curative instruction to preserve any error for appeal, the record was insufficient to show a constitutional violation, and the court was satisfied that the trial court made a good faith effort to protect the rights of the parties. Defendant was afforded a fair opportunity to present his defense. In affirming, the court held that defendant was allowed to offer all the evidence he wished, and his counsel had wide latitude in arguing involuntary intoxication to avoid the legal effect of voluntary intoxication.</SPAN></P>

The lower court held that the contractor was entitled to recover on the theory of unjust enrichment and that the statute was an unconstitutional infringement on the powers of the superior courts.

The court looked to cases dealing with related first amendment issues, such as picketing and distribution of handbills. After reviewing the circumstances of the shopping centers in question, the court found they functioned as a business district, thus their roadways and sidewalks served the same public forum function as a public business district. After balancing the first amendment rights, the importance of the initiative process, the quasi public nature of the streets and sidewalks of the shopping centers, and the potential for reasonable regulation of solicitation activities against the shopping center's property rights, the court found that the council must be allowed to solicit signatures on the shopping center property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's order which denied the council's motion for a permanent injunction against the shopping centers in an action that sought to allow the council to solicit signatures for an initiative petition on shopping center property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was charged with two counts of indecent liberties but the second count was dismissed. With respect to the first count, the 12-year old boy who was involved testified that defendant, who was a neighbor, asked him to come to his house to carry some boxes. Once inside defendant's house, defendant took indecent liberties with the boy. The boy then immediately went to another neighbor's house and related the events that had occurred. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient. The boy's statement to the neighbor was sufficiently spontaneous, natural, and contemporaneous with the event to have permitted its admission in evidence under the res gestae exception to the hearsay rule. The court also held that the trial court did not err by refusing to permit cross-examination of the boy for the purpose of establishing his bias as a witness. The record failed to show that the trial court actually refused to permit further cross-examination to establish bias. The question objected to in the trial court was answered and the questions that followed also dealt with bias and were asked without further objection.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the search of the car was conducted without a warrant was not incident to an arrest. The court found that it was reasonable for the officers to make efforts to determine the identity of the owner of the car. The court noted that the car was illegally parked with a key in the ignition and that there was no registration properly displayed in violation of state statute. The court stated that those facts justified the intrusion into the vehicle.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 12.49.010(g) made it unlawful to loiter in a public place in a manner and under circumstances manifesting the purpose of inducing, enticing, soliciting or procuring another to commit an act of prostitution. Defendant argued on appeal that the ordinance was unconstitutional because (1) it's failure to describe overt conduct that constituted criminal as distinguished from innocent loitering rendered it vague, (2) it failed to require actual proof of a real and present intent, and (3) it infringed on her right against self-incrimination. In affirming the convictions, the court held that the ordinance was constitutional. The court found that (1) the ordinance was not vague because it proscribed loitering in a manner and under circumstances manifesting an unlawful purpose, which was expressly specified: to induce another to commit an act of prostitution, (2) &sect; 12.49.010(g) described an offense, malum in se, consisting of two elements: intent and an overt act. The indispensable intent, which was necessarily implied, was to induce another to commit an act of prostitution, and (3) the ordinance did not force defendant to answer a police officer's questions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was transferred from the county jail to the penitentiary pending appeal. Defendant's petitions for writs of habeas corpus alleged that his transfer to the penitentiary was unlawful. The court affirmed the denial of habeas corpus relief. Because defendant's first conviction had expired, the court determined that defendant could not be held in custody under that conviction. The court concluded that defendant's transfer to the penitentiary under Wash. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed on appeal that &sect; 9.19.050 was void for vagueness and that the portion of the statute making possession of burglary tools prima evidence of the intent to use the tools in the commission of a crime violated the Due Process Clause of U.S Const. amend. XIV. The court first determined that the language of &sect; 9.19.050 was sufficient for persons of common understanding and intelligence to ascertain the conduct that was prohibited thereunder and, therefore, that the statute was not void for vagueness. The court then determined that the evidentiary presumption created by &sect; 9.19.050 did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment because there was a rational connection between the possession of burglary tools and the presumption that the possessor intended to use them in the commission of a crime. The court also found that the presumption was constitutionally permissible under the comparative convenience test because a possessor of burglary tools was in a far more favorable position than the prosecution to explain what his intentions were.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners asserted four theories of liability in their action against the city: negligence, trespass, inverse condemnation, and breach of covenant. The trial court only instructed the jury on the theory of negligence. The jury rendered a verdict for the city. The property owners appealed. Upon review, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that there was no error in refusing to instruct on inverse condemnation because the case involved, at most, a tortious injury to property, and not, under the evidence produced, an unconstitutional taking of property. The court held that there was no error in the refusal to instruct on trespass because the property owners' proposed instruction did not correctly state the law, in that it omitted the requirement that any alleged intentional intrusion on their property was done with knowledge that it would to a substantial certainty result in the entry of the foreign matter that caused the damage. Further, the court held that there was no substantial evidence that the city was negligent in the removal of vegetation from a right-of-way and easement, which the property owners claimed caused the damage to their property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, State of Washington (state), on the relation of the attorney general, sought review of the decision of the Superior Court for Klickitat County (Washington), which entered a judgment for respondents, public utility district (PUD), PUD commissioners, PUD manager, in an action seeking a declaration of respondents' rights, duties, and powers, and seeking to enjoin the continuation of the PUD's installment sales program.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In order to improve its system load factor, the PUD carried on an installment sales program under which it took assignments of sellers' interests in conditional sales contracts from dealers or electrical contractors. The PUD only took assignments with recourse against the dealer or contractor. The state filed an action against respondents, seeking a declaration of respondents' rights, duties, and powers and seeking to enjoin the continuation of the sales program. The trial court entered a judgment for respondents. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the program was not an unconstitutional lending of credit to a non-governmental body under Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 7 because it was not established that any individual sale was made by a dealer in reliance upon the credit of the PUD. Further, the program was not an unconstitutional loan of public money under Wash. Const. art. 8, &sect; 7 because the relationship of debtor and creditor did not exist as to any contract. Finally, there was ample authority in the act creating the public utility districts, 1931 Wash. Laws 1, as subsequently amended, to support the purchase of a vendor's interest in the conditional contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the decision entering a judgment for respondents in the action seeking a declaration of respondents' rights, duties, and powers, and seeking to enjoin the continuation of the PUD's installment sales program.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a prior trial, petitioner was acquitted of murder. Following the acquittal, petitioner was re-arrested on informations that charged him with murder of another victim and an assault arising from the same acts in which he was acquitted. Petitioner filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of double jeopardy and collateral estoppel. The trial court denied the motion. Petitioner then filed an application with the court for a writ of prohibition to direct the trial court to dismiss the informations. The court granted the writ of prohibition. The court found it had jurisdiction to issue an extraordinary writ because petitioner had made a compelling attack of the charges, which if accepted would terminate future litigation. The court held no double jeopardy violation occurred where petitioner stood charged with different offenses, even though they arose from the same act. The court determined petitioner's pending prosecution was prohibited under the collateral estoppel doctrine because the retrial of petitioner for assault and murder would have required relitigation of the same ultimate fact upon which petitioner was acquitted, i.e., did he mail a package containing explosives.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court issued a writ of prohibition directing the dismissal of informations against petitioner for murder and assault. The court directed petitioner to be discharged forthwith from custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order of the Superior Court for King County, Washington, which convicted him of indecent liberties. Defendant also filed two writs of habeas corpus in addition to his appeal. Defendant's appointed appellate counsel filed a motion requesting permission to withdraw as counsel and an Anders brief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Anders brief set out six categories denominated &quot;Possible Assignments of Error.&quot; On appeal, the court held that the record showed that defendant waived his jury trial rights intelligently, voluntarily, and free from improper influence, and showed facts sufficient to support the conviction. The court held that there was no merit in defendant's claim that he was too drunk to have formed a specific intent because none was required, and a trial court ruling that admitted testimony of a police officer about his conversation with a doctor that examined the victim was proper because defendant's counsel had previously introduced part of the same conversation as evidence. The charge against defendant was in the words of an applicable statute and not void for vagueness. The writs of habeas corpus claimed that sentencing provisions of Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 9.95.040 were invalid because the legislature, in repealing a prior statute, referred to the prior statute by its section number only and did not set out its full text as allegedly required by the Washington Constitution, but the court found that the legislature's procedure was consistent with one approved by the court in another case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court for Franklin County, Washington, entering a jury verdict finding him guilty of forgery and of being an habitual criminal. Defendant had allegedly passed a forged check drawn on the account of his former employer. Defendant did not deny passing the forged check, but claimed that he could not remember it because his weakened mental condition from habitual alcoholism had rendered him insane.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to trial, defendant's motion for a hospital examination to establish his insanity defense was denied, but he was granted an interview with a court-appointed psychiatrist. Defendant offered no expert testimony at trial on his inability to distinguish between right and wrong because of his habitual alcohol use, but narrated his long, troubled history of alcoholism. There was no evidence to show defendant was intoxicated at the time he passed the check. The court concluded that the evidence was insufficient to warrant an instruction on insanity. The court also held that defendant's case was not prejudiced by two witnesses' incidental references to other crimes, ostensibly unrelated to defendant's crime. Any prejudice was corrected by the instruction to the jury to disregard. However, the court found merit in defendant's contention that there were no properly certified exhibits at trial to sustain his habitual criminal conviction. The court held that the copies introduced at trial did not comply with 28 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1738 and Wash. Rev. Code &sect; 5.44.010, which contemplated that the original certifications of convictions from other jurisdictions would be introduced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed defendant's conviction and sentence. Because the sentence was invalid, the court ordered the State to produce defendant in the trial court for imposition of sentence either under the forgery statute, or for new trial on the issue of whether defendant was an habitual criminal.</SPAN></P>
