</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner North Dakota State Treasurer sought an injunction prohibiting the issuance of certain bonds in an action for a declaratory judgment that was filed against respondents, North Dakota Industrial Commission, North Dakota Water Commission, and commission members. The Commissions and the members sought a writ of mandamus to compel approval of the bond issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature enacted N.D. Cent. Code ch. 61-24.3, ch. 61-24.4, and amended N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-51.1-07, to provide for the construction and financing of a pipeline to alleviate water shortages in the southwest corner of North Dakota by treating and transporting water from the Missouri River to various communities and industrial users. Pursuant to the legislation, the Industrial Commission entered into agreements to implement the project. The State Treasurer refused to sign the agreements and instituted the instant action. The Commissions and their members sought a writ of mandamus against the State Treasurer. The court granted the requested injunction and denied the writ of mandamus. The court held that bonds funded by any general state tax, excise or ad valorem, constituted a &quot;debt&quot; of North Dakota within the meaning of the state debt limitation, N.D. Const. art. X, &sect; 13. The bonds in question exceeded $ 2 million, were unsecured, and did not fall within any of the listed exceptions to the debt limitation. The special-fund doctrine did not exempt the obligations in question from the debt limitation because the bonds were to be funded from general tax revenues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the State Treasurer's petition for an injunction against the bond issue in question and denied the writ of mandamus sought by the Commissions and their members.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant cooperative association challenged the judgment of the District Court of Burleigh County (North Dakota) that affirmed an order of the North Dakota Securities Commissioner requiring the cooperative association to refrain and desist from the further offer or sale of membership agreements in North Dakota until the offer or sale of the agreements has been registered with the Securities Commissioner pursuant to the N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 51-19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The North Dakota Securities Commissioner commenced an administrative action seeking to require the cooperative association to register membership agreement offers in compliance with state franchise law. A hearing officer concluded that the agreements between the cooperative association and its members did indeed constitute franchises as defined at N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 51-19-02(5) and ordered the cooperative association to refrain from offering further memberships until it registered with the commissioner. After the district court affirmed the administrative ruling, the cooperative association sought further review. In affirming, the court concluded that the membership agreements were franchises because they were contracts whereby, in return for a fee paid by the purchasers, the cooperative association granted and the purchasers received certain delineated rights and obligations. Further, no equal protection violation was established because the record established no discriminatory intent on the part of the legislature or any discriminatory effect that arose from the different treatments afforded to agricultural cooperatives and retailer-owned cooperatives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the District Court of Mercer County, South Central Judicial District (North Dakota) convicting him of possession of marijuana in violation of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 19-03.1-23(3). Defendant claimed that the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him for the reason that it created a strict liability offense and he was denied a fair trial by the prosecutor's refusal to grant immunity to a defense witness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of marijuana as a result of a search of a trailer home. The search was authorized as a condition of defendant's probation in a prior judgment of conviction. The court had held that the search was valid even though it was conducted by police officers rather than by defendant's probation officer. In affirming defendant's conviction by the trial court, the court determined that defendant had failed to raise a legal or justifiable ground to relitigate the issue. Defendant did not adequately raise or present a constitutional challenge to the validity of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 19-03.1-23 nor did he demonstrate adequate standing to challenge the statute. Neither the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution nor N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 required the State to grant immunity to defense witnesses. The prosecutor's refusal to dismiss charges against a co-defendant or to grant her immunity did not violate defendant's right to a fair trial or to call witnesses on his own behalf.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant was not deprived of a fair trial and had not adequately challenged the constitutionality of the possession statute. The judgment of conviction by the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, county and state, challenged a decision of the District Court of Stutsman County (North Dakota), which reduced the assessed value of a malting plant owned by appellee taxpayer. Appellants contended that the district court erred in classifying certain property as personal property exempt from ad valorem taxation. The taxpayer claimed the district court erred in classifying certain property as taxable real property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon receipt of a land statement based on the full value of its malting plant, the taxpayer sought an abatement, claiming that part of its property was improperly classified as real property and that the portion of the value pertaining the use of the structures and buildings should have been classified as personal property. The district court found that the facility was not a special use facility requiring the whole plant to be classified as real property and reduced the value of the plant. The court reversed and remanded the matter to give the parties an opportunity to present argument concerning the plan in light of its interpretation of the movability aspect of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-02-04(2). It found that the movability aspect encompassed both economic as well as physical considerations and determined that items that could be removed without rendering the structure or building nonfunctional, without extensive repair or redesign of the structure or building, and without replacement of removed items satisfied the requirement that personal property be removable without materially limiting or restricting the use of such structures or buildings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the district court, which reduced the assessed value of the taxpayer's plant, vacated the order of the board of county commissioners, and remanded the matter to the board of county commissioners for the parties to present argument based on the court's interpretation of the movability aspect in determining whether property was to be considered personal or real property for tax purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant banks sought review of a decision of the District Court of Burleigh County (North Dakota), which upheld appellee North Dakota Tax Commissioner's denial of the banks' claims for a refund of privilege taxes they had paid. The banks argued that the trial court erred in granting the commissioner's motion to dismiss their action, wherein they alleged that the taxes imposed were discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The banks paid privilege taxes pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 57-35.2-02, which imposed a tax on the banks for the privilege of transacting business in the State. The banks paid the taxes, but had not paid them under protest. Instead, they sought a refund for the taxes paid, arguing that because &sect; 57-35.2-02 exempted the banks' income received from bonds for State projects and not income received from similar federal projects, the tax was discriminatory. The trial court affirmed the commissioner's denial of the refund and dismissed the banks' action. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed the banks' action. The court determined that even if the banks had shown that the tax was unconstitutionally discriminatory, they failed to show that the federal government had similar projects to those exempted under &sect; 57-35.2-02. Thus, the court held, the banks failed to demonstrate how they were injured by the alleged offensive language in the legislation imposing the privilege tax. The court also held that because the banks did not pay the taxes under protest, they did not have the right to recover for the tax payments that they voluntarily made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff employee brought an action after his managerial position with the North Dakota Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) was not renewed by defendant, the DMV registrar. The employee claimed a violation of his rights under U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV and N.D. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 4, and 7, as well as 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The District Court of Bureligh County dismissed the action, and the employee appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the employee's branch office agreement with the DMV expired, it was not renewed. The employee's action was against the registrar in his official capacity, and claimed the agreement was not renewed solely because the employee was a member of the Democratic Party. The employee alleged violations of U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV and N.D. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 1, 4, and 7, as well as 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983. The trial court dismissed the action. On appeal, the court concluded that the state was the real party in interest and was entitled to raise whatever defenses and immunities it had available. Suing a state official solely in his official capacity, as opposed to suing the official in his individual or personal capacity, was tantamount to suing the state itself. The employee elected to sue the registrar solely in his official capacity. He could not then claim that he sought to hold the registrar personally liable. Further, the court stated that the state had absolute immunity from suit. Without its consent it could not be sued in any court, by any person, for any cause of action whatever. The state could constitutionally raise sovereign immunity as a bar to the employee's action.</SPAN></P>

Cent. Code &sect; 47-16-37 in their action to terminate mineral leases under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 47-16-36. The assignee claimed that the trial court erred in holding that it was not a bona fide purchaser and in awarding damages, attorney fees and costs to the lessors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The assignee agreed to purchase a mineral lease from a predecessor assignee of the lessee before it was executed. The lessors executed and delivered the lease to the lessee in exchange for a sight draft in the amount of consideration specified in the lease. When the sight draft and a subsequent check from the lessor were dishonored, the lessors notified the assignee that the lease was forfeited as provided in N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 14-16-36. On appeal, the court held that the assignee was not a bona fide purchaser for value and without notice of the lessees' fraud on the lessors. The court reasoned that the assignee had constructive notice of the fraud under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 1-01-25 because if it had acted with reasonable diligence, it would have discovered that the lessees tendered only a sight draft to the lessors and had not paid them cash. The court determined that although N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 14-16-37 allowed prevailing lessors to recover damages, costs and attorney fees but did not allow such recovery to prevailing lessees, it did not violate the Equal Protection Clause and was not an abuse of the trial court's discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that was against the assignee in the lessors' action to terminate a mineral lease and for statutory damages, costs, and attorney fees.</SPAN></P>

Code ch. 32-24, the County Court of Cass County (North Dakota) certified the question whether the application of the enhanced penalty provision of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-08-01 based on defendant's conviction for driving while intoxicated that occurred before the statute's enactment violated the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 and N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two years after a first conviction for driving while intoxicated (DWI), defendant was again charged with DWI. N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-08-01, which was enacted after the first conviction, raised the penalty for a second offense within 24 months to a class A misdemeanor. Defendant argued that application of the enhanced penalty provision violated the ex post facto clause; he also sought to suppress the results of the blood test. By agreement of the parties, the trial court stayed the proceeding and certified the question whether the application of the enhanced penalty under &sect; 39-08-01 would be unconstitutional. The court declined to answer the question and dismissed the proceeding. Where a determination of the ex post facto issue was not wholly or principally determinative of the case because the issue of defendant's guilt had not yet been resolved, a ruling on the applicability of the penalty provision would be merely advisory. Under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 32-24-02, the court could dismiss a certified question if the result of the action would not be determined by the answer to the certified question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the proceeding on the certified question and remanded the case to the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, several news media organizations, filed for a supervisory writ and for an ex parte order against respondent trial judge of the County Court (North Dakota) in order to stay the preliminary hearing in defendant's murder prosecution. The trial judge granted defendant's request that the preliminary hearing be closed to the public pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 29-07-14. The stay was granted pending the court's review of the petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted defendant's request that the preliminary hearing be closed to the public pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 29-07-14. Various news media organizations sought a writ to compel the trial court to reverse its order on the grounds that both the state and federal constitutions required the preliminary hearing to be open. The court held that the constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press did not give the press a superior right of access to judicial functions than that of the public. In addition, a preliminary hearing was more analogous to a grand jury proceeding than it was to a trial, so the same level of public access was not applicable. The court held that such proceedings could be closed for good reasons. One such reason was the possibility of exposing the public to evidence that was admissible for the preliminary hearing but not for the trial and thus could possibly taint the jury pool or otherwise deny defendant his right to a fair trial: a right, the court held, that was clearly superior to the right of public access and had to be protected. The court examined the trial court's reasons for its decision and found no abuse of its discretionary authority.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no abuse of discretion by the trial judge in its order closing the preliminary hearing to the press and public. The court vacated the stay and denied the news media organizations' petition for a supervisory writ. The court found the issue before it to be a matter of first impression and of vital concern to the public and assessed no costs against either party.</SPAN></P>

Because the court found that the statute's language was ambiguous, it considered the extrinsic interpretation factors in N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 1-02-39. After reviewing the legislative history, the court concluded that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 28-01.07 allowed the seller to seek indemnification from the manufacturer because the manufacturer was found liable and the seller was absolved. The court's interpretation precluded the manufacturer's constitutional attack on &sect; 28-01.07. Because the manufacturer did not submit a proposed question on whether the seller was a seller as defined by N.D. Cent.

The trial court denied both. The court dismissed petitioner's appeal of the denial of the application for post-conviction relief as premature. Affirming the denial of the motion for a new trial, the court found that petitioner's preliminary appearance before the judges of two counties did not violate his rights against double jeopardy because jeopardy had not attached. The failure of the court reporter to record the opening and closing arguments in petitioner's second trial did not deny him due process because there was no suggestion that any error occurred during the arguments. The trial court's application of the dangerous special offender statute did not constitute ex post facto law merely because on of the offenses relied upon occurred before the statute was enacted. Miranda was not violated by allowing testimony from the psychiatrists who examined petitioner because he waived the Fifth Amendment privilege by raising the issue of his sanity with his own psychiatric evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the property owner's allegations that the zoning ordinance was an unreasonable, arbitrary, and discriminatory spot zoning and, thus, unconstitutional. The property owner failed to show that the zoning change violated any provision of the federal or state constitution. The court also held that the rezoning did not exceed the bounds of police power and did not accomplish a taking without just compensation as prohibited by N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court found no substantial expenditure by the property owner in reliance on an unchanged ordinance and no support for the property owner's claim of estoppel. Finally, the court determined that the actions of the property owner prior to the rezoning of his property did not constitute the establishment of a non-conforming use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's verdict that defendant committed the crime of robbery with the aid of an accomplice actually present based on the victim's testimony that he was attacked and robbed by defendant and her daughter. Any error in the trial court's failure to include a lesser-included offense instruction was not preserved for review, and the alleged error was not an obvious error that affected defendant's substantial rights. Although the trial court's instruction on the use of a witness' prior inconsistent statements erroneously permitted the jury to consider her statements as evidence of their truth, the error did not affect defendant's substantial rights. The prior statements did not increase the material evidence of defendant's guilt because the victim unambiguously testified that defendant and her daughter attacked and robbed him. The court determined that defendant waived any objection to the use of her post-arrest statement that was obtained after she was apprised of her constitutional rights because she failed to raise it prior to trial as required by N.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendants were arrested on drug charges, a small quantity of marijuana was located in plain view on the dashboard near one of them and a one pound bag, along with an incriminating list, was found in the back seat near the other. Both were charged with unlawful possession of marijuana and with unlawful possession with intent to deliver, pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 19-03.1-23(1), (3). The front seat rider was convicted of unlawful possession; the back seat rider was convicted of possession with intent to deliver. On appeal, the court first noted that an experienced police officer could testify as an expert under N.D. R. Evid. 702. The court explained that the state was not required to prove intent to convict for possession, only actual or constructive possession, which was a strict liability offense. To satisfy both parts of the &quot;intent to deliver&quot; conviction, the state was not required to prove intent on the possession but was required to prove intent on the delivery. Defendants lacked standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality. The evidence was sufficient to support the verdicts against each defendant. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

After plaintiffs still failed to obtain an expert even after being given additional time by the trial court to obtain one, their claim was dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiffs appealed contending that &sect; 28-01-46 was inapplicable because it was not in effect at the time their action arose. On appeal, the court reversed and ruled that although &sect; 28-01-46, which called for dismissal if a claimant did not obtain a medical expert within three months of the commencement of an action did not apply retroactively, existing case law still required plaintiffs to obtain a medical expert to support a prima facie case of medical malpractice.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners own approximately 20 acres of land located within the city. Prior to the establishment of the city, the property owners' land was zoned residential by another city under its extraterritorial zoning authority. Subsequent to the establishment of the city at issue, a comprehensive zoning ordinance zoned the property owners' land for public use. The city did not commence eminent domain proceedings to acquire the property owners' property, nor did it otherwise offer to compensate the property owners for their land. The city intended to use the land in the future for the construction for a school. The trial court dismissed on its merits an inverse condemnation action brought by the property owners against the city. On appeal, the court found that the zoning ordinance had the purpose and practical effect of appropriating private property for public uses without giving the property owners the constitutionally required compensation. The trial court's judgment was reversed and remanded on appeal for further proceedings to determine the amount of just compensation to which the property owners were entitled for the regulatory taking of their property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with two other individuals for conspiracy to deliver a controlled substance. The other individuals pleaded guilty and testified for the state against defendants.

Defendants were arrested without a warrant and an inventory of defendants' billfolds at jail revealed phone numbers that tied defendants to the conspiracy. One defendant also sought to sever the trial against the other defendant. Defendants were convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed and held in part that: (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it refused to grant defendants a separate trial under N.D. R. Crim. P. 14; (2) the automatic-standing rule was not longer applicable to defendants' claim that the search of a co-conspirator's hotel room violated U.S. Const. amend. IV; (3) the searches of defendants' billfolds were conducted pursuant to a lawful arrest; and (4) out of court statements of defendants and the co-conspirators were properly admitted under N.D. R.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court of Burleigh County (North Dakota), which convicted him of the delivery of a controlled substance. Defendant claimed his motion to dismiss should have been granted because N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 19-.03.1-23(1), of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties stipulated that the issue on appeal was strictly one of law as to whether or not the complaint should have been dismissed based on the alleged unconstitutionality of &sect;19-03.1-23(1). Defendant claimed that the absence of a culpability requirement in the statute could not impose strict liability. On review, the court rejected the State's argument that defendant lacked standing because there was no claim that he mistakenly or unwittingly delivered a controlled substance in view of the fact he was charged with a willful violation. The court noted that defendant did not file a writ of prohibition and that the motion to dismiss was not appealable. It held, however, that it could determine whether the statute was constitutional to determine whether the trial court had jurisdiction to convict. The court found that the statute was constitutional because the legislature had the power and intended to make persons criminally liable without an intent to violate the drug prohibitions in the statute. Thus, defendant failed to show that the statute violated due process or proportionality in punishment under U.S. Const. amend. VIII, XIV, or N.D. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 11, 12.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The county court deferred imposition of judgment and sentence.

The court affirmed. The court determined that the arresting police office had probable cause to search defendant's motor vehicle. The court rejected the State's position that defendant's motion to defer imposition of sentence under Rule 35 did not preclude defendant's appeal because the order deferring imposition of sentence and judgment was the result of a proceeding subsequent to and dependent upon the verdict. The court also rejected defendant's argument that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 29-07-01.1, which mandated that an indigent defendant reimburse the county for the costs of his court-appointed counsel, was not unconstitutional because it did not invidiously discriminate between an indigent defendant and an non-indigent defendant or other judgment debtor.</SPAN></P>

Reversing, the court held that a jury instruction on intent was unconstitutional in view of the evidence and defendant's reliance on the defense of mental disease or defect. The instruction deprived him of his right to due process of law. Intent was a critical component of the crime. Defendant was charged with intentionally or knowingly causing the death of another human being. The jury might have been misled by the instruction. They could have regarded the presumption as mandatory. The jurors were not told that they had a choice or that they might infer that conclusion. They were told that the law presumed it. The jurors might have viewed the presumption as shifting the burden of persuasion to defendant. The instruction was an obvious error. The trial court properly refused to instruct the jury on involuntary manslaughter. The requisite evidentiary showing of recklessness was not made. There was no evidence that defendant was exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming stress, that he suffered an extreme emotional reaction to it, that the victim provoked defendant, or that he felt any emotion toward the victim.</SPAN></P>

Cent. Code ch. 50-22, the False Advertising Law, N.D. Cent. Code ch. 51-12, and the Consumer Fraud and Unlawful Credit Practices Law, N.D. Cent. Code ch. 51-15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The charity contracted with the solicitor to promote a musical production of a television show. Under the contract, the solicitor was to conduct a telephone solicitation campaign for advance ticket sales. The charity was to pay the solicitor from the funds collected and was also to pay the actual costs for producing the show.The charity planned to use the money collected for its charitable activities. Defendants did not submit their contract to the state for approval and the solicitor did not register with the state as required by N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 50-22-02.1. In its judgment against the state, the trial court declared various provisions of the Charitable Organizations Law, N.D. Cent. Code ch. 50-22 unconstitutional. The court affirmed the order in part and held that the Charitable Organizations Law, specifically N. D. Cent. Code &sect; 50-22-02.1, amounted to a prior restraint on the speech of a charitable organization and its solicitors. The court also reversed the order in part, remanded, and held that the state's causes of actions for alleged violations of the False Advertising Law and the Consumer Fraud and Unlawful Credit Practices Law were dismissed in error.</SPAN></P>

However, the court reversed the part of the order that dismissed the state's causes of action for violations of the False Advertising Law and the Consumer Fraud and Unlawful Credit Practices Law and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved an amendment to a coordinating agreement between the power company and its subsidiary for the allocation of loses incurred from the abandonment of a planned generating unit, the power company filed a notice of change in the intrastate retail rates with the state public service commission. The state commission specifically eliminated from the power company's cost of service in the state the losses that were sustained by its subsidiary. Upon review, the court reversed. The court held that the state public service commission did not have jurisdiction in an intrastate retail proceeding to examine and to determine the reasonableness of a power company's intrastate retail expenses where the area of retail rates had been federally preempted. The court found that it would have undermined the supremacy clause and the preemption doctrine for the state public commission to indirectly assert jurisdiction over interstate wholesale rates. The court concluded that pursuant to 16 U.S.C.S. &sect; 824(a) of the Federal Power Act of 1935, the FERC was the appropriate entity to determine the reasonableness of the power company's losses.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded to the state public service commission with instructions that the rate filed with FERC be treated as an actual operating expense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A proceeding was instituted to answer questions of law certified by the Cass County Court (North Dakota) in the prosecution of defendant for issuing a check without sufficient funds either at the time of issuance or at the time of presentment within one week of the original delivery, a violation of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 6-08-16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 6-08-16 was unconstitutional in that it did not set out a mens rea, intent, or culpability and in effect provided for strict criminal liability. The defendant further contended that if the statute was not unconstitutional for those reasons, then only a fine, but no incarceration penalty, was imposeable. The court answered the certified questions, holding that the lack of culpability requirement did not render &sect; 6-08-16&nbsp;unconstitutional. It was a regulatory statute, and it was proper for a legislature to enact laws making the violation thereof a matter of strict criminal liability. The court further held that it was constitutionally permissible to sentence an offender to the penalty of a class B misdemeanor, which permitted up to 30 days' imprisonment and a fine of $ 500, or both, for a violation of &sect; 6-08-16.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the District Court of Burleigh County (North Dakota), which convicted defendant of violating North Dakota securities law. Defendant was charged with offering for sale or selling securities when he was not registered as a dealer under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 10-04-10 and for offering for sale or selling unregistered securities under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 10-04-04. Defendant raised several issues on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On defendant's appeal of his conviction, defendant sought a rehearing. However, the court affirmed the judgment for several reasons. The preliminary hearing was not defective for only having one witness because, under N.D. R. Crim. P. 5.1(a), there was sufficient evidence presented to allow the magistrate to conclude that defendant had committed an offense. In addition, the promissory notes sold by defendant fell within the definition of &quot;security&quot; under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 10-04-02(12) because &quot;note&quot; included &quot;promissory note.&quot; The informations complied with N.D. R. Crim. P. 8(a), which allowed more than one offense to be charged in the same information when they were of similar character. In the instant case, defendant gave promissory notes to several persons, and the notes and the transactions were substantially the same. The charges did not violate the equal-protection provisions of the federal or state constitutions because the exemptions contained in the state Securities Act promoted the purposes of the Securities Act in prohibiting fraud. The statutes were not vague because they clearly stated that, unless exempted or otherwise excused, all securities had to be registered.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's petition for rehearing on his conviction for securities law violations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county attorney challenged the judgment of the District Court of Cass County (North Dakota), which denied her request for a permanent injunction under the Sunday Closing Law, N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-30, to restrain appellee corporation from operating its grocery stores on Sundays. The dispositive issue was whether the corporation qualified for the small grocery store exception to the law pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-30-03(28).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the applicable statutes, businesses for profit could not operate on Sundays, but there was a statutory &quot;small grocery store&quot; exception in order to allow the sale of statutorily authorized personal items. The issue was whether the corporation qualified for that exception. On review, the court interpreted the statute as permitting any small business whose manager was also its owner or at least a sizable shareholder to operate on Sundays, while barring larger businesses whose managerial staff were not owners or shareholders. The court also held that that the statutory exception for businesses run by manager owners was rationally related to the legitimate government objective of providing a day of rest and was not in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The record showed that the corporation had four stockholders who did not manage any of its nine grocery stores, all of which were operated by hired staff the majority of which were part-time. The court concluded that the trial court erred in holding that the corporation qualified for the exception and remanded the case for a trial on the unresolved issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that had denied the county attorney an injunction against the corporation in order to compel it to comply with the Sunday closing law; the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

A few years later, defendant filed a motion for expungement of his arrest record. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant appealed. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that while there was no statutory or constitutional right to expungement of an arrest record, a trial court had authority and an arrestee who was not subsequently convicted was entitled to expunction of arrest records where the arrest was in violation of the arrestee's constitutional rights. Therefore, on remand, the trial court was required to determine whether defendant's prior arrest was without probable cause or otherwise in violation of his constitutional rights so as to entitle him to expunction of his arrest records.</SPAN></P>

The trial court generally affirmed the ordinances' constitutionality but dismissed the city's action for injunctive relief. Both parties appealed; the court reversed the judgment as to injunctive relief and affirmed the judgment as to constitutionality except as to the disclosure requirement of Minot, N.D., Ordinance No. 2337. The court held that the city could use the nuisance law, N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 42-02-01, to enjoin the distribution of specific material. Closing the operation for one year as a remedy would constitute an impermissible prior restraint upon freedom of speech. Some elements of the city's disclosure requirements exceeded constitutionally permissible boundaries.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the finding of the constitutionality of the city's new ordinances, then reversed the dismissal of the city's action for injunctive relief and remanded the case for trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former superintendent appealed from the judgment of the District Court of Cass County (North Dakota), which dismissed the contest of election action against defendant candidate. The candidate cross-appealed from the ruling that his &quot;false statement&quot; violated N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 16-20-17.3 and from the refusal to consider the constitutionality of funding limitations contained in the Corrupt Practices Act, N.D. Cent. Code ch. 16-20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former superintendent filed a notice of contest of election in which he alleged that the candidate's action in preparing a certain letter constituted an &quot;illegal act&quot; within the meaning of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 16-20-22 and that the candidate, his opponent in the election, had exceeded the campaign spending limitation set forth in N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 16-20-04. On appeal, the court analyzed pertinent provisions of the Corrupt Practices Act. Because the candidate did not knowingly issue a false statement under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 16-20-17.3 and because N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 16-20-04 was unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 4, the judgment of the district court was affirmed and the contest of election action was dismissed. The court determined that the candidate exceeded the 15 percent limitation on campaign expenses prescribed by N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 16-20-04. However, the state's interests were not sufficient to justify the infringement of the candidate's fundamental First Amendment rights of free speech and association. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance prohibited dancing by paid performers on a licensed premised. The court found that because U.S. Const. amend. 21 conferred upon the states something in addition to their normal police power over health, welfare, and morals, the ordinance, confined as it was to licensed liquor establishments, was not an unconstitutional infringement on free speech or expression. The court held that it was within the power of the city, under the combined authority of its police power and U.S. Const. amend. 21, to prohibit dancing by paid performers through the ordinance. Accordingly, the court did not see a need for a requirement that a greater degree of specificity exist in the ordinance regarding what conduct it prohibited. The court found that the provision within the ordinance requiring licensees to have identification cards of performers, noting their ages, was within the authority of the city to place the burden upon the licensee to make sure that the people performing in a licensed establishment were not minors. In conclusion, the court found that the ordinance was not vague, overbroad, or irrational and was enacted under the legal authority of the city.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured sold the buyers a mobile home and sold the financing contract to the bank. The bank later repossessed the mobile home due to delinquent payments and the buyers brought a federal action for damages against the injured and the bank. The injured was told by the bank's law firm that he would be &quot;taken care of&quot; in the buyers' action, but the buyers were awarded damages against the injured. The injured brought an action to recover damages against appellees, and the trial court granted appellees' motions for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision as to the law firm, but reversed as to the bank, holding that the injured's complaint adequately set forth a claim against the bank based upon an alleged contract of indemnity and thus his action for damages for the breach of that contract was governed by the six-year statute of limitations provided in N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 28-01-16(1). The court determined however that because the injured's claim against the law firm sounded in malpractice based on a breach of the firm's professional duty, N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 28-01-18(3) provided the applicable two-year statute of limitations and thus that claim was time-barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On August 18, 1977, an employee died in a hospital due to difficulties in the administration of anesthesia Both the Bureau and the widow applied for the establishment of a medical malpractice review panel in November 1979. The district court judge to whom the application was submitted ruled that the medical review panel statute was unconstitutional and did not convene such a panel. On December 14, 1979, the widow filed a wrongful death action. On review of the a grant of a summary dismissal, the court held that the district court properly found that the widow's action was barred by the two year statute of limitations applicable to wrongful death actions. The limitations period began on the date of the decedent's death and the widow's action was barred as of August 18, 1979. The filing of the application for a medical review panel was filed after this date and did not toll the limitations period. The court noted that the Bureau had standing to appeal the ruling, but that any review of the ruling on the constitutionality of the medical review panel statute was foreclosed because the district court never properly acquired subject matter jurisdiction of this issue.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought a new trial for the following reasons: (1) that amendment of N.D. R. Crim. P. 12.1 was in the instant case ex post facto in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10; (2) that he was denied his due process right to present defense evidence; and (3) that the court was &quot;manifestly unjust&quot; in its refusal to allow, for the record, an offer of proof regarding evidence sought to be introduced at trial. The court held that the new form of N.D. R. Crim. P. 12.1 did not &quot;criminalize&quot; any acts not criminal before January 1, 1980, nor did it increase the penalty for any criminal act. Thus, the court concluded that the amendment of Rule 12.1 was procedural in the sense that it did not ground a challenge based on the ex post facto clause. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling inadmissible defendant's alibi evidence. The State first learned of the evidence at trial after it had completed its case. That was exactly the type of situation the rule was intended to prevent. Defendant objected to the trial court's handling of an offer of proof made near the end of trial. The trial court refused even the offer itself, and the court held that was error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case for retrial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with attempted murder.

The court affirmed the conviction, holding first that both the defense and the prosecution had to right to request the district court to give jury instructions on lesser included offenses. Defendant could be convicted of a lesser included offense that was not contained in the original indictment against him. Additionally, the district court was not required to submit defendant's instructions in the specific language requested by him, and the district court could refuse to submit an inapplicable instruction to the jury. Furthermore, a special interrogatory submitted to the jury was not designed to coerce the jurors into rendering a guilty verdict. The interrogatory was necessary to distinguish whether defendant was guilty of a felony or a misdemeanor under the reckless endangerment statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Exemptions from unemployment compensation taxation were originally provided under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 52-01-01(13)(h) for persons in the employ of a church or association of churches, &sect; 52-01-01(13)(h)(1), and for elementary and secondary schools, &sect; 52-01-01(13)(h)(3). After the latter exemption was repealed, the church was notified that its school was subject to coverage under the North Dakota Unemployment Compensation Law. The Division determined that the school was required to pay unemployment taxes under the statute. The Bureau affirmed the Division's decision. The trial court reversed the Bureau's determination. On appeal, the court held the that the clear and unambiguous language of &sect; 52-01-01(13)(h)(1)(a) provided an exemption for services performed in the employ of a church and that the removal of &sect; 52-01-01(13)(h)(3) did not ipso facto remove the other exemption. The court held that the end result of including church schools in unemployment compensation legislation raised serious questions as to excessive governmental entanglement with religion. Accordingly, it avoided the interpretation which created such disharmony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The minor fell off a slide while playing on the school district's grounds during a class recess. The next friend on behalf of the minor filed an action for damages against the school district and gave notice of the claim to the district on the same day. The trial court granted summary judgment to the school district, dismissing the friend's complaint for failure to file a claim within 90 days against the school district under the provisions 1975 N.D. Laws 295, &sect; 4(1). On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that actual notice of an incident or injury by a political subdivision employee did not satisfy the claim filing requirements of &sect; 4(1). The claim filing requirement of &sect; 4(1) was mandatory and the failure to file a claim as required by that provision precluded the right to bring an action against a political subdivision. However, N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 28-01-25 operated to extend the time within which a minor could file a claim under &sect; 4(1) to 90 days after the minor reached 18 years. Thus, the minor's action against the school district was not barred by her failure to claim within 90 days after her injury occurred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 15 years old and was involved in an informal adjustment before a juvenile supervisor in which he admitted to committing the unruly act of truancy. Defendant was placed on probation, but the truancy problems continued. A petition was filed alleging that defendant was an unruly child in that he was habitually truant from school. The juvenile supervisor fount that he was habitually truant, and the trial court confirmed the supervisor's finding. On appeal, the court upheld the judgment. The court ruled, after having reviewed the evidence anew, that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 27-20-02(4)(a), which set forth the standards for determining whether or not a defendant was an &quot;unruly child,&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed with defendant's argument that the words &quot;habitually&quot; and &quot;without justification&quot; were too vague to provide adequate standards. The court found that statutory draftsmen often used those words, and the courts had construed them without apparent difficulty. The court stated that mere use of general language did not support a vagueness challenge. The court ruled that the State did not have to prove there was no justification for the absences.</SPAN></P>

The district court affirmed, and, on review, the court affirmed. The court noted that N.D. Cent.

While district courts were permitted to hear testimony and receive exhibits, evidence had to be viewed in light of the factual findings, the decision, and the reasons given therefor by the Board. N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 11-11-43 had to be read as merely providing the procedure by which the proceeding could be brought before the court to determine whether or not the Board acted properly.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case concerned the validity of a partial veto by the Governor and the constitutionality of the assignment by the legislature of duties to the Lieutenant Governor of the State of North Dakota. The Governor contended that the legislative branch had infringed upon the authority granted to him by the North Dakota Constitution to assign duties to the Lieutenant Governor. The court held that the exigencies required that the court accept original jurisdiction in the case. The court concluded: (1) that the attempted veto of &sect; 1 of Senate Bill 2460 was void and not authorized by N.D. Const. &sect; 80; (2) that Senate Bill 2460, in its entirety, became law by the operation of N.D. Const. &sect; 79 when, within 15 days after the end of the legislative session, a valid veto was not filed with the Secretary of State; (3) that part of &sect; 1 of Senate Bill 2460 which assigned the duties of federal aid coordinator to the Lieutenant Governor was unconstitutional; and (4) that the balance of Senate Bill 2460 remained operational under the direction of the federal aid coordinator appointed by the Governor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the city council denied the property owners' request for a change in the zoning of their property from agricultural to commercial, the property owners requested the city council to create a board of adjustment (board) to hear appeals. The city council appointed themselves to the board and again denied the requested rezoning. The district court granted the property owners' request for a writ of certiorari directing the city council to appoint an independent board. The court reversed and dissolved the order, concluding that the board did not have jurisdiction to review a legislative decision of the city commission not to rezone the property owners' land. The court determined that Washburn, N.D., Ordinance 83, &sect; 2.3.5, which provided that aggrieved persons could appeal city council decisions to the board, was invalid because it improperly delegated legislative authority. The court held that the ordinance exceeded the limits authorized by the enabling statute,&nbsp;N.D. Cent.

The court found that the ordinance was both inartistically drawn and internally inconsistent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner brought an action against the city for inverse condemnation after the city enacted an ordinance regulating her land. The court affirmed the district court's dismissal of the landowner's action for inverse condemnation, but because the issues were of first impression, the court remanded the case for amendment of her complaint to include a declaratory judgment action. The court found that as N.D. R. Civ. P. 12(b) required the district court to treat the city's motion as one for summary judgment where both parties presented matters outside the pleadings. The court held that the city's action did not become an exercise of its eminent domain power entitling the landowner to an inverse condemnation action where the landowner's action was based solely on the city's enactment of and refusal to amend an ordinance. The court held that inverse condemnation applied where the government went beyond mere regulation of the use of private property and through physical activity such as the construction of public improvements or disposal of waste, it disturbed property rights belonging to property owners.</SPAN></P>

The father appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the father failed to show that the petition was insufficient under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 27-20-21, and that the father did not preserve the issue. Therefore, the father's due process rights were not violated. The motion for a continuance was properly denied because the father, as a convict in jail, did not have a constitutional right to personally appear at a hearing where he was properly represented. The record clearly established that the father abandoned the child by failing to discharge his parental obligations before and after the child's birth.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the juvenile court's judgment terminating the father's parental rights to his infant daughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant sought and received a certificate of public necessity to transport various materials in tanker trucks. In affirming the decision, the court first held that any irregularity in the granting of a temporary certificate was not subject to challenge based on guidance issued by the court in another case five months after the temporary certificate was issued. The court next held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 28-32-19 as amended to require a &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; standard of review of PSC decisions was constitutional, because it did not call for an independent review of the evidence in contravention of N.D. Const. &sect; 94, but simply articulated a deferential standard of review. The court then held that the decision of the PSC to issue the permanent certificate comported with the prohibition of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 49-18-14 that a certificate should not issue unless the existing service was inadequate. Finally, the court held that the applicant's prior uncertificated transport of liquefied petroleum gas had no bearing on the present application.</SPAN></P>

The district court held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 65-01-01, the statute which excluded agricultural service from the mandatory provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act (Act), violated the Constitutions of North Dakota and the United States.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The scope of the employee's work was characterized as agricultural. Section 65-01-01 specifically excluded agricultural service from coverage under the Act. The court analyzed the purpose of the Act and noted it clearly provided that the Act created a fund for the benefit of employees injured, and the dependents of employees killed, in hazardous employment. The district court held that the statutory exclusion of &sect;65-01-01 deprived the employee of equality, imposed upon him a non-uniform burden, violated his right to due process of law, invidiously discriminated against him; and, failed to provide him with due process and equal protection. The court agreed with the district court's findings and held that the exclusion of agricultural employees from the benefits of the Act was unreasonable and contrary to the expressed purpose of the Act. The court further held that its holding applied to the employee's case and was applicable to future claims arising out of injuries occurring to agricultural employees on and after July 1, 1981.The court found that the exclusion unjustifiably withheld relief awarded to other wage earners merely upon the classification of agriculture.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and remanded the case for such further proceedings in the district court as was necessary to facilitate the award of benefits to the employee by the Workmen's Compensation Bureau.</SPAN></P>

The individual contended that the notice requirement of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 40-42-01 was repealed by the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act of 1975 and that the &quot;family car&quot; doctrine applied to the vehicle owner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual was rendered a paraplegic in an auto accident involving a vehicle driven by the vehicle owner's son. The individual filed an action against the vehicle owner, alleging the application of the &quot;family car&quot; doctrine, and against the city, alleging negligent maintenance of the skyway on which the collision occurred. The district court granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of the city and granted the vehicle owner's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 40-42 was not impliedly repealed by the Political Subdivision Tort Liability Act of 1975 and that the individual was required to give notice to the city in accordance with &sect;40-42-01. The court held that, after an intermediate level of judicial scrutiny, the provisions of &sect; 40-42-01 and that &sect; 40-42-02 did not deny the individual his constitutional right of equal protection. As to the claims against the vehicle owner, the court held that the son was not a member of the vehicle owner's family for purposes of the &quot;family car&quot; doctrine and declined to extend the &quot;family car&quot; doctrine in a manner that discouraged normal, desirable interaction between family members.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment on a jury verdict in favor of the farmers. The trial court denied the organization's motion for a new trial or for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The organization appealed, and the court affirmed. The court found that there was substantial evidence to support the jury's verdict; therefore, it would not be disturbed on appeal.

The district court found that the developers failed to comply with certain requirements, but remanded it back for further consideration of the developers' revised plat. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the disapproval of the proposed subdivision plat by the commission did not preclude the board and the district court from considering whether or not to approve it. Additionally, the court held that the district court did not err in its application of the criteria within a county zoning resolution for the approval of the plat.</SPAN></P>

The court held that certain newspaper articles did not interfere with the fairness and impartiality of the jurors who read them. The court ruled that the evidence of guilt contained in the news articles was subsequently introduced by the testimony of the witnesses. The court held that the presumption was that the jury performed its duties in accordance with the law and were not influenced by any outside evidence. The court ruled that the trial court did not error in admitting testimony from defendant's cellmate because there was no evidence that the cellmate acted for the police.

The board requested certification of a question relating to whether an appeal from an administrative agency heard by the district court de novo pursuant to N.D. Cent.

The jailer heard the husband ask defendant to bring him &quot;joints&quot; and he heard the couple talk about selling a few jars of &quot;speed&quot; to raise bond money. Based upon that information, officers obtained a search warrant for defendant's trailer. The police executed the warrant and found a substantial quantity of illegal drugs. The police also found illegal drugs in a brown purse owned by the husband's sister (the other defendant). Both defendants were arrested. The court held that: (1) defendant's sister had standing to bring a motion to suppress the evidence to be used against her; (2) the usual Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures did not apply to the conversation between defendant and her husband while they were on the jail telephone; (3) the search of the trailer house was not unconstitutional; and (4) the evidence obtained during the search could be used against the two defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lumber mart appealed a judgment dismissing a negligence and contract claim against the nonresident transportation company for lack of personal jurisdiction, contending that the transportation company's negligent repair of a tractor was one of concurrent causes for damages sustained.

The court affirmed the judgment, concluding that the transportation company had insufficient contacts with the state to support a constitutional exercise of personal jurisdiction. The court observed that the nonresident party had to have made minimal contacts in the forum state which were directly related to the cause of action. The court found that the transportation company's contacts consisted solely of interstate commerce activity that was unrelated to the cause of action. The court found that the transportation company's activity hauling potatoes through and across the state was unrelated to the tractor repair service performed in Montana. The court found that the transportation company's minimal contacts with the state simply did not relate to the lumber mart's action arising from the repair.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment which dismissed without prejudice the lumber mart's negligence and contract claims against the transportation company.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, highway commissioner and board, appealed a judgment of the District Court of Cass County (North Dakota), which determined that they had not provided for &quot;effective control&quot; of advertising structures near highway systems as required by the Highway Beautification Act of 1965, specifically 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 131(c). The sign company cross-appealed, claiming it was entitled to compensation for the removal of its signs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under regulations established pursuant to the Highway Beautification Act of 1965, particularly 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 131, the highway department removed nonconforming signs. The sign company objected to the removal of its signs without just compensation. The highway board, the highway commissioner, and the sign company all appealed the judgment of the trial court. The court reversed the judgment in part and remanded for further proceedings. By accepting benefits of permits issued by the commissioner, the sign company was estopped from attacking the constitutionality of a rule that governed construction of signs issued under the permits. The North Dakota Highway Beautification Act (Act) did not deprive the sign company of all or substantially all of the beneficial use of its property. The legislature validly exercised its police power by regulating signs for aesthetic considerations. The Act's restrictions on the place and manner of outdoor advertising signs were justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, served a significant governmental interest in providing a safe and visually-pleasing environment, and left open ample alternative channels for communication.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment and found that the language of the constitutional provision allowed for &quot;free public schools.&quot; The court construed the provision to include textbooks.

The trial court held that denying appellee the right to compete with established businesses violated his federal and state constitutional rights. The court questioned whether the constitutional challenge was properly raised and determined that such challenge was proper if it was based solely on the administrative record. The court, however, reversed the judgment on grounds that the denial of the permit violated neither the federal nor the state constitutions because substantive due process in economic matters did not constitutionally prohibit legislation limiting entry into occupations or professions.</SPAN></P>

The court found that there was clear and convincing evidence to support the finding that the children were deprived. The children were without proper parental care and control, subsistence, and did not receive the care necessary for physical, mental and emotional health. In addition, the court concluded that the deprivation was not due to the parents' lack of financial means. The court reversed the judgment terminating the parents' parental rights because the evidence was not clear and convincing that the causes and conditions of the deprivation were likely to continue. Thus, the termination of the parents' rights was not sustainable under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 27-20-44(1)(b). The court remanded the case to the juvenile court for disposition in accordance with N.D.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Burleigh County District Court, Fourth Judicial District (North Dakota), which convicted him of attempted sexual imposition and denied his motion for new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal defendant argued, inter alia, that (1) the trial court erred in refusing to allow inquiry into the complainant's sexual relationship with her boyfriend, when the defense was mistaken identity for her boyfriend; (2) the State's attorney committed misconduct in making certain statements during closing argument; and (3) the jury instructions were vague and indefinite. Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. Defendant did not comply with the procedures outlined in N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-20-15. The record contained no written motion or affidavit. In the absence of such a record demonstrating defendant's compliance with &sect; 12.1-20-15, the court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in refusing to allow him to inquire into the complainant's sexual history. Even though the statements of the State's attorney may have been improper, they did not constitute reversible error because they were made in response to remarks of defense counsel. The jury instructions regarding the essential elements of the offense, taken as a whole, were clear and are not misleading.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Attorney General of North Dakota, on behalf of the Director of Institutions requested that the court issue a supervisory writ directed to respondent district judge, requiring him to delete certain words from a judgment sentencing a defendant to the state penitentiary. The court directed an order to the judge to show cause why the writ requested by the attorney general should not issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Director of Institutions routinely transferred female prisoners to institutions outside the state. The judge, in sentencing a female defendant, specified that she had to be imprisoned at a certain penitentiary in the state and &quot;in no other place.&quot; The Director challenged the sentence. The court held that she could not be imprisoned outside the state unless and until a due-process hearing had been held or waived and an order entered permitting the transfer. The court determined that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 54-21-25, under which authority the Director could transfer inmates out of state, lacked the requisite procedural due-process standards and was therefore unconstitutional. The court noted, however, that the concurrence of four members of the court was required to declare a statute unconstitutional and only three members of the court concurred. The court determined that it did still have power to order compliance with due process. The court concluded that the prisoner had to be initially confined in the state, and if a transfer became necessary, the Director could hold a hearing of which she would have notice, with opportunity to prepare, and at which she could appear with counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition for a supervisory writ for the limited purpose of modifying the sentence, and denied the writ in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

Cent. Code ch. 40-57.1. The district court also determined that the chapter was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer applied for an exemption from ad valorem taxation on property on which a malt and barley preparation facility and grain elevator was planned. The Board granted the exemption and the district court affirmed the ruling. On appeal, the court also upheld the Board decision. The court first found that the proceedings before the Board were not invalid due to lack of due process. The Board meeting at which the exemption was granted was a reasonable postponement of the earlier meeting, before which notice was given in conformance with N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 40-57.1-03. Later meetings finalizing the exemption did not require re-issuance of notice; however, any reversal or modification of the prior action would have required notice. The court also ruled that the taxpayer was entitled to the exemption as a &quot;new industry,&quot; because it was the type of project encouraged under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 40-57.1-01. Finally, the court concluded that N.D. Cent. Code ch. 40-57.1 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the Board and State Board of Equalization, that it did not violate the Uniformity or Privileges and Immunities Provisions, N.D.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a county sheriff, was charged with committing the crime of reckless endangerment. Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that North Dakota's reckless-endangerment statute,&nbsp;N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-17-03 was unconstitutional. The district court held that the reckless-endangerment statute failed to set an ascertainable standard of guilt because it was vague, indefinite, and overbroad. The court reversed the district court's order and held that the statute met the constitutional requirements. The court held that although no culpability requirement was mentioned in the body of the statute itself, &sect; 12.1-02-02(2) provided that that the default culpability required was &quot;willfully.&quot; The court held that the language gave adequate warning of the conduct proscribed. The court held that &sect; 12.1-17-03 set forth an ascertainable standard of guilt, and therefore did not operate as a denial of due process of law, and that it provided a reasonable and rational distinction between conduct that amounts to a felony and that which amounts to a misdemeanor, and did not operate as a denial of equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a minor child born out of wedlock, brought an action against defendant personal representative to establish her right to inherit from her father's estate. Under N.D. Cent. Code ch. 32-24, the District Court of Stutsman County (North Dakota) certified two questions: 1. Did the two-year limitation of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 32-36-09 bar the action or did it only apply to support? and 2. Did laches or estoppel bar the claim?</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A child born out of wedlock was seven years old when her father died. There was no judicial determination of paternity, though the father stated that the child was his and lived with the child and her mother until his death. The personal representative stipulated that there was clear and convincing evidence of paternity, but contended that the child's claim to inherit from the father's estate was barred under the two-year limit of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 32-36-09 and the doctrine of laches due to the mother's failure to act. The trial court ruled that limitations and laches did not apply, and certified the issues. In affirming the decision that the action was not barred, the court held that the mother's failure to bring a proceeding to determine paternity within two years of birth did not bar the child's claim because the right to support was distinct from the right to inherit. Where the father was already supporting the child, the mother had no incentive to act and the child would not be penalized for her failure to do so. Where clear and convincing proof existed, N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 30.1-04-09(2)(b) permitted a determination of paternity after the parent's death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court answered the questions in the negative, thereby affirming the trial court's decision that the child's action was not barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The father raised numerous contentions including that the former illegitimacy law, N.D. Cent. Code ch. 32-36, was unconstitutional. The court held that: (1) the father had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of Chapter 32-36 on the ground that it denied him an equal cause of action to establish his own paternity, as that given to a mother, because the father had not suffered any such discrimination; (2) the mother was under the same duty to support the child as the father and either party's failure to provide support was subject to criminal sanctions; (3) the admission of the blood tests was proper because the father could have introduced evidence showing the jury to what degree the nonexclusionary blood groupings were inconclusive; (4) the trial court properly instructed the jury concerning the probative value of the blood tests because such instruction did not afford too much weight to the tests; and (5) the trial court improperly ordered support payments until the child reached 18 because the new N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 32-36-21, which required payments until the child reached 18, was only to be prospectively applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested by a sheriff's department and was charged with operating a motor vehicle upon a public highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Defendant was cited to appear before the judge, who presided over a county court. Defendant then filed a proceeding against the judge, seeking a writ of prohibition. Defendant claimed that after the effective date of N.D. Const. art. IV, &sect; 85, the county courts no longer existed. The court found that the new constitutional provision provided for judicial powers in other courts as could be provided by law. The court also found that neither the title nor the body of the new provision made any mention of repealing any statutory provisions. The court held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect;&sect; 27-07, 27-08, relating to county courts and county courts with increased jurisdiction were not repugnant to, in conflict with, or inconsistent with the new provision and were not repealed and would remain in full force and effect until repealed or amended by appropriate legislative action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion to dismiss an appeal by the State to an order of the District Court of Sheridan County (North Dakota), which held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 12.1-17-03 was unconstitutional. Defendant, a sheriff, had been charged in county justice court with reckless endangerment, a violation of &sect; 12.1-17-03. His motions attacking the constitutionality of the state were denied. While an appeal was pending, he sought a writ of prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court granted defendant's motion for a writ of prohibition on grounds that &sect; 12.1-17-03 was unconstitutional and the complaint did not state an offense. When the State appealed, defendant contended that the order was not appealable. The court held that the order was appealable because a motion to dismiss a complaint was equivalent to a motion to quash an information and N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 29-28-07(1) provided that orders quashing informations were appealable. On that point, the court overruled State v. Bauer, 153 N.W.2d 895 (N.D. 1967). It did not matter that the complaint was brought in county justice court when the dismissal was ordered by a district court's final adjudication. An application for a writ of prohibition was an appropriate way to attack a statute's constitutionality because N.D. Cent. Code ch. 32-35, which authorized the writ of prohibition, was taken from California law and California courts had consistently maintained that an application for writ of prohibition was an appropriate way to attack a statute's constitutionality. A district court could pass on a statute's constitutionality, with the state supreme court having the last word.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the State's appeal from an order of the district court that held that the state's reckless endangerment statute was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, the state lieutenant governor, asked that the North Dakota Supreme Court exercise its original jurisdiction under N.D. Const. &sect; 86 and issue an original prerogative writ, seeking an order prohibiting the North Dakota Senate of the 45th Legislative Assembly from conducting its affairs and proceedings under N.D. Senate Rules 26 and 55.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review of the constitutionality of N.D. Senate Rule 26, the Governor contended that the rule was unconstitutional. The Senate argued that the rule was mandated by N.D. Const. &sect; 65. The court found that there was a justiciable controversy, since there was a present and existing conflict that prohibited the Lieutenant Governor from voting except on procedural matters. The exceptional circumstances surrounding the case directly affected not only the elected officials, but also the integrity of the law-making process of the legislature. The court held that &sect; 65 acted as a specific limitation on &sect; 77 of the North Dakota Constitution, prohibiting the Lieutenant Governor, as president of the state Senate, from casting a tie-breaking vote on the final consideration of a bill in the senate. Insofar as Rule 26 applied to the final disposition of a bill, it was found constitutional, and was also constitutional as to votes on final disposition of resolutions proposing amendments to the state constitution and to votes on final disposition of resolutions proposing or ratifying amendments to the United States Constitution. Rule 26 was not constitutional as to other resolutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The writ was denied insofar as the rule was found to be constitutional, and granted to the extent that it was found it unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a wife and daughter of a man convicted of second degree murder and imprisoned for seven to 10 years, challenged an order of the District Court of Stutsman County (North Dakota), which granted a motion to strike parts of their complaint against appellees, three licensed liquor dealers, and requested answers to certified questions about actions for loss of consortium and support pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 5-01-06.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife claimed that she was entitled to bring an action for loss of consortium pursuant to the Act, and one of the dealers moved to strike the words &quot;society, companionship, counsel, and guidance&quot; from the complaint and all of the daughter's claims for lack of support, advice, and counsel of her father. The questions of a wife's action for loss of consortium and whether a child could recover for loss of counsel and guidance both before and after majority were certified. On review, the court found that a right of consortium was property under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 5-01-06, that loss of consortium was a cause of action available to wives as well as husbands, and that to hold otherwise would violate N.D. Const. &sect; 20 and the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause. The court ruled that the daughter could not sue for loss of counsel and guidance under the existing law, but that its statement was not to be construed to prohibit recovery where a parent died and recovery was allowed under the Wrongful Death Act, N.D. Cent. Code ch. 32-21, and that there was a rational basis for distinguishing between a spouse's loss of consortium and a child's loss of counsel and guidance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed in part the order granting the motion to strike, answered the first certified question, on a wife's action for loss of consortium, in the affirmative, and answered the second and third certified questions, on a child's action for loss of counsel and guidance before and after majority, in the negative. The court remanded the action for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with burglary and sought to excluded evidence of his boots. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress and he was convicted. He filed an appeal approximately three months later. The State sought dismissal of the appeal on the grounds that it was untimely. The court granted the motion to dismiss. The court found that defendant's appeal was untimely because under N.D. R. App. P. 4(b) and N.D. R. Crim. P. 37(b), it was required to be filed within ten days from the entry of judgment or within 40 days if an extension was granted. Despite the untimeliness, the court reviewed defendant's substantive claims on the grounds that the claims could be raised again in a petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court did not err when it denied defendant's motion to suppress the boots and related statements because under the totality of the circumstances defendant's consent to the search was voluntary. The seizure of the boots did not violate defendant's Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination because the interrogation was investigatory and non-custodial. Defendant also failed to show that his counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The children were from the wife's prior marriage. The wife had custody and the father had visitation rights. After the wife remarried, she and the husband sought the adoption. Remanding for a hearing on the father's fitness, the court concluded that a parent whose parental rights had not been previously terminated judicially or by consent was constitutionally entitled to a hearing on his fitness under the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. Terminating the father's parental rights without consent or without just cause would have raised serious constitutional impediments. Under N.D. Cent. Code &sect;14-15-19(3)(c), the grounds for termination of parental rights rested on the father's attitude, conduct, ability, and other aspects of a parent's duties, responsibilities, and care for the children. The parent-child relationship consisted of a bundle of human rights that had to be carefully balanced and jealously guarded. The termination question had to be resolved first and the adoption thereafter. The husband shared custody of the children with the wife. The children on reaching the age of consent could agree to be adopted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded for a rehearing to litigate the question of the father's fitness, but ordered that if a rehearing was not made within 10 days, that the dismissal would be affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff passenger appealed a ruling of the District Court of McLean County (North Dakota), which dismissed the passenger's action against defendants, a minor driver and his father, to recover for injuries the passenger sustained in an automobile accident caused by the driver. The father sponsored the driver's license application. The parties stipulated to the absence of intoxication, willful misconduct, or gross negligence on defendants' part.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The passenger argued that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-06-09 created a new cause of action against the sponsor of a minor's license application when the minor committed any negligence when driving and amended the guest statute, N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-15, which precluded recovery in the absence of intoxication, willful misconduct, or gross negligence. On appeal, the court disagreed. N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-06-09 did not expressly state that a sponsor was liable for any negligence of a minor; rather, the sponsor's liability had to be shown through the applicable statute, which, in the case at bar, was the guest statute. Thus, the court held that &sect; 39-06-09 did not create a new, independent cause of action. Further, to overcome the presumption against implied repeal, an irreconcilable conflict between two provisions had to be shown. However, there was no conflict between the provisions in question sufficient to imply that &sect; 39-06-09 was intended to repeal the guest statute. As such, the court held that the driver's negligence could not be imputed to the father in the absence of intoxication, willful misconduct, or gross negligence; given the parties' stipulation, the action was properly dismissed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of disturbing the peace. Defendant appealed. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that defendant failed to establish how his First Amendment constitutional rights were violated or dampened by &sect;5-01-05.3. The court stated that the facts established that defendant's acts were not protected by the First Amendment. The court noted that defendant was arrested because he was sitting in the middle of an intersection, partially blocking traffic, at an odd hour, making loud noises, and fighting the police when they tried to remove him. The court further stated that defendant should have known he was disturbing the peace and could not claim that the language of &sect;5-01-05.3 was too general and failed to forewarn him that such conduct was criminal. The court determined that the State had the power to enact laws that proscribed the conduct that defendant was charged with and that the statute under which he was charged was not intended to regulate speech but conduct that threatened the public peace.

The court held that employment as a teacher and school board member were incompatible within the meaning and intent of the common-law rule. Further, it held that no constitutionally protected right to hold incompatible offices or employment and the rule against holding incompatible offices or positions did not result in an unconstitutional infringement of personal and political rights.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, assignee of a hospital (hospital), appealed a judgment of the District Court of Walsh County (North Dakota), which dismissed the complaint against defendant, a patient's son. Pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 25-09-04, the hospital sought to recover against the patient's son for supplies and services provided to the patient. The district court found that &sect; 25-09-04 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital sought to recover from the patient's son upon an account for supplies and services provided to the patient. The action was brought under &sect; 25-09-04. The district court found &sect; 25-09-04 was unconstitutional and dismissed the complaint. The court affirmed on appeal. The statute imposed upon some relative's a financial burden related to a state function, which was not imposed upon others. There was no requirement to first seek payment from the patient, and no right of subrogation provided to the burdened relative. The court held that the classification was arbitrary and oppressive. There was no reasonable relationship between the legislative purpose of reducing the financial burden upon the state for providing care to those who had been involuntarily committed to the state mental hospital, and the selection of the class of &quot;responsible relatives&quot; designated in &sect; 25-09-04 to accomplish that purpose. Thus, &sect; 25-09-04 denied equal protection guaranteed under N.D. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 11, 20. The statute had been amended to relieve adult children from responsibility, and the court stated that its conclusion did not apply to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 25-09-04, as amended and reenacted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment dismissing the complaint.</SPAN></P>

The utility filed an application with the Public Service Commission for a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Appellee cooperative filed objections. The commission held a hearing and ruled in favor of the utility. The cooperative filed an appeal. The District Court of Burleigh County (North Dakota) reversed the decision as arbitrary and capricious. The utility filed an appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeal was one of a series of disputes between electric cooperatives, which were organized to provide electricity to residents of rural areas, and stockholder-owned utilities, which provided electricity to municipalities that had granted them franchises. The customer owned property about one-third mile south of the city limits. The area between his property and the city limits was undeveloped. The utility held the franchise to supply electricity within the city limits. The cooperative served the area surrounding the city. The commission granted the utility's application to provide service to the customer. The trial court reversed. The court affirmed. The utility had not proven that the public convenience and necessity reasonably required that it be allowed to extend its lines to serve the customer. There was no evidence that the utility could have served the customer without wasteful duplication of investment or service. Because that and all other factors favored the cooperative, or favored neither the utility nor the cooperative, there was no evidence to justify the conclusion that the public convenience and necessity required issuance of a certificate to the utility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board undertook massive administrative and legal efforts to close down appellee corporation's operations. Eventually the board ordered a receiver to be appointed to liquidate appellee corporation on the basis of insolvency, but the lower court reversed the order. On appeal, the court held that the board's makeup was not ipso facto unconstitutional because it had banker-members. It further held that even though the board had been involved in efforts to declare appellee corporation insolvent, the controlling statute did not provide for the disqualification and temporary replacement of board members or for a substitute tribunal. Finding no lack of due process, the court held that the rule of necessity, requiring otherwise disqualified officers to serve when no other provisions have been made, prevailed. The court then held that there was no evidence that the board acted with any improper motives in its efforts to close down appellee corporation's operations, and that there was substantial evidence to support the board's findings. Thus, the court reversed the lower court's judgment and directed it to enter judgment on remand affirming the board's order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother and the father were divorced and the mother was awarded custody. The mother concealed where the children were for five years and moved to North Dakota. The children were permitted to visit the father in Missouri. The father refused to return the children and commenced suit in Missouri. The mother commenced suit in North Dakota. Before a hearing was held in Missouri, the mother surreptitiously removed the children from Missouri. After a hearing, the North Dakota court awarded custody to the father. The mother sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held: (1) the trial judge was favorably impressed by the home the father provided for the boys; (2) the mother had an unsettled marriage, her home lacked discipline, and the mother had questionable moral conduct; (3) the motel adultery incident alone was insufficient to change custody, however, under N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 30-10-06(2), the children were of the age to require education and preparation for labor, for which custody should be given to the father; and (4) the trial court's finding that the best interests of the children were to be served by placing their custody in the father was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The drug store claimed that the requirement of N.D. Cent.

The Board asserted that the requirement was a proper exercise of the legislature's authority to regulate the pharmaceutical business for the protection of the public and the purpose was reasonable and legitimate. The court, after recognizing that the United States Supreme Court had determined that &sect; 43-15-35(5) did not violate the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, determined that the purpose of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 43-15-35(5) was reasonable and the classification of drug store's, as distinguished from hospital pharmacies, was rational and &sect; 43-15-35(5) did not violate N.D.

XIV or the Commerce Clause of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff bank appealed a judgment of the District Court of Foster County (North Dakota), which granted the motion of defendant nonmortgagor debtor for summary judgment in an action seeking recovery on a promissory note. The debtor interposed the statutes limiting deficiency judgments in suits on debts secured by real property mortgages as an affirmative defense including N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 32-19-06 (1951).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Four persons, including the debtor, executed a promissory note with the bank. Two of the individuals later executed a mortgage to the bank as security for the note. The debtor argued that the bank had to seek recovery for nonpayment of the note against the two who had executed the mortgage. The trial court held that the statutes limiting deficiency judgments applied and forbid the action. The court reversed on appeal. The language of N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 32-19-06 (1951) created an ambiguity in the last two sentences. However, the court found that the legislature intended to require, if a deficiency judgment was desired, that an action separate from the foreclosure action be brought against nonmortgagor debtors as well as mortgagors by referring to parties &quot;personally liable.&quot; Separate actions were allowed to be brought without foreclosure, but recovery was limited to the same amount as if foreclosure had been had. N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 32-19-07 (1951) provided that neither before nor after cancellation or foreclosure was an action allowed to be brought to recover any part of the debt secured by the mortgage so foreclosed, except as provided in N.D. Cent. Code &sect;&sect; 32-19-04, 32-19-06 (1951).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child required educational services not available in respondent local school district, which entered into a contract with a private school in another county. Her parents were unable to pay the charges at that school, so the local school district paid the tuition, and the county board paid for foster care and general subsistence. The parents then moved to Minnesota, and petitioner, the Special Education Division Of the Department Of Public Instruction of the State of North Dakota, filed an action in the juvenile court in the county where the school was located for a determination of the child's needs, and who would be responsible for them. The juvenile court determined that the child was a resident of Williams County, the county board was responsible for the subsistence and foster care, and the state board was responsible for the tuition. On appeal, the court affirmed the determination that the child's residence determined who was responsible for her care. The county board was responsible for the subsistence and foster care. The court reversed and remanded the determination on the tuition cost, and ruled that the local school district continued to be responsible for it.</SPAN></P>

The school district was responsible for those costs on remand.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, upon a jury verdict, entered judgment in favor of the passengers. The driver filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The trial court denied the motion and held that the passengers payment for the gas on a social trip did not take the passengers out of the guest statute and, further, the court held that N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-15 was unconstitutional. The driver appealed. On appeal, the court determined that the arbitrary distinction between paying and nonpaying guests contained in the statute was not justified by an illusory fear of collusion or perjury. Further, the court determined that the guest law found in N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 39-15 did not operate uniformly and that it gave a special immunity from liability for ordinary negligence to a special category of persons, namely owners and drivers of automobiles who negligently caused injury to their passengers.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and subsequently entered into a nursing home in North Dakota. After his benefits to defray the nursing home costs were terminated by the State of Minnesota, his mother applied for benefits from North Dakota on his behalf. The application was denied because he was not a resident of North Dakota for medical assistance purposes. He was granted an administrative hearing before the Social Service Board of North Dakota (Board), but the decision of the Cass County Welfare Board denying his application was affirmed. On appeal, the trial court held that the applicant was eligible for benefits. The issue was whether the residency regulation, as applied by the Board to the factual situation in the instant case, contravened the United States constitution. The court found that the applicant was classified as a nonresident for medical assistance purposes because he came to North Dakota for the primary purpose of receiving medical care. The court held that the residency regulation invidiously discriminated against the applicant for medical assistance and infringed upon his constitutional right to travel freely from state to state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A special agent learned that packages containing marijuana were being sent to North Dakota. The Jamestown police department was promptly notified of the arrival of each package at the bus depot. The police opened the packages, and each package was resealed after the contents were identified as marijuana. Defendant signed a receipt for one of the packages and was arrested with the package in his possession. Defendant's motion to suppress was denied, and the district court found defendant guilty, a jury having been waived. Reversing, the court held that defendant had standing to contest the constitutionality of the search and seizure. To hold that the State could, without a warrant, seize and open sealed packages and use the evidence thereby obtained to convict a person who later picked up the package offended U.S. Const. amend. IV and N.D. Const. &sect; 18. To deny standing to defendant because he did not testify to a possessory interest and thereby acquire immunity was to substitute ritual for reality. The court held that the State had no right to make &quot;caretaking&quot; searches of packages in bus depots and that no routine police procedure justified a warrantless search of the packages.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the decision of the district court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, state governor and adjutant general, sought review of a judgment from the District Court, Burleigh County (North Dakota), that declared N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 37-25-02(8)(d)&nbsp;unconstitutional. Appellants also challenged orders allowing appellee veteran's action to proceed as a class action and allowing attorney fees to be paid out of the adjusted compensation to be paid to North Dakota veterans who became eligible to receive compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The veteran brought the action for the purpose of securing payment of a veteran's bonus under the North Dakota Vietnam Conflict Veterans' Adjusted Compensation Act. The veteran asserted that &sect; 37-25-02(8)(d) was unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection of the law because it arbitrarily and discriminatorily classified North Dakota veterans. The court reversed the judgment that declared &sect; 37-25-02(8)(d)&nbsp;unconstitutional, concluding that the statute was reasonably related to the statute's purpose of compensating only residents of North Dakota who were veterans of the Vietnam Conflict. The court found that the classifications established were not invidious and, thus, were not repugnant to either the state or federal constitutions. The court affirmed the trial court's order allowing the maintenance of a class action, finding that the requirements of N.D. R. Civ. P. 23 were met. The court also affirmed the trial court's order related to attorney fees, concluding that all class members who benefitted from a lawsuit should contribute to the expense. The court remanded for consideration of issues that were left undecided by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment that declared the statute unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The arbitrators concluded that the subcontractor was entitled to an award of money damages. This conclusion was based upon their belief that the State Highway Commissioner on the project did in fact owe a duty to the subcontractor to require the prime contractor to 90 psi proof test the subgrade and to repair and to continue to repair any soft spots detected until the subgrade successfully withstood the proof rolling called for in the plans and specifications. Only then was there a &quot;completed&quot; subgrade within the contractual terms. The trial court upheld the arbitrators' decision. On appeal, the court determined that its review of a judgment entered upon an arbitration award was strictly limited. The court adopted the New York rule that save for irrationality, arbitrators were free to determine the facts and make the awards. The court held that when a motion to vacate an arbitration award was made pursuant to N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 32-29-08, the award was not be set aside unless it was completely irrational. The court concluded that reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the award to the subcontractor, it could not say that the award was devoid of rationality.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that statutes adopting by reference the laws of the federal government and the regulations promulgated thereunder by one of its agencies in existence at the time of the enactment of the adopting statutes was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power. The court held that the federal order and regulations designating LSD as having a hallucinogenic effect were in full force and effect on the effective date of the 1967 North Dakota Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Act), which was in full force and effect at the time defendant committed his offense. The court further held that the state Act was not too loosely drawn to give adequate warning of the conduct proscribed and to mark the boundaries sufficiently distinct for judges and juries to fairly administer the Act.</SPAN></P>

The auditor refused to take the action necessary for the city to proceed with a mall project in downtown Fargo. The trial court ordered the writ of mandamus to be issued. The auditor appealed and the city cross-appealed. The court agreed with the district court that N.D. Cent. Code ch. 40-62 and Fargo, N.D., City Ordinance No. 1395 did not contravene N.D. Const. art. I, &sect; 14. The court also held that the district court was correct in its determination that N.D. Cent. Code ch. 40-62 adopted N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 40-22-05 by reference. The court found that the Fargo City Home Rule Charter granted the city the power to exercise eminent domain to take the property necessary for construction of the mall project. The court held that the abutting property owners were entitled to have the city initiate eminent domain proceedings for the purpose of ascertaining damages for injuries to their property rights in the street.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Specifically, the corporation argued that the Corporate Farming Law denied them equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the state and federal constitutions. The corporation claimed that it must be permitted to form a corporation to engage in the business of farming, although the corporation may be required to dispose of such farm lands as were not reasonably necessary in the conduct of such business after 10 years. The court believed that there was a reasonable basis for the classification made. The legislature did not make such an arbitrary or unreasonable discrimination as to constitute a denial of the equal protection of the law or the requirement that all laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation. The Corporate Farming Law applied equally to all citizens, without any discrimination, who desired to form a business corporation, and not a co-operative, for the purpose of engaging in the business of farming or agriculture. It operated alike on all persons who come within its provisions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the District Court of Grand Forks County (North Dakota), which denied his motion for a new trial. The district court previously entered a judgment in which defendant was found guilty by a jury of the crimes of murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. Among defendant's many contentions on appeal was an allegation that he was not given Miranda warnings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the same day of the crime, defendant testified at a State's Attorney's inquiry. Later that evening he was taken into custody by the State's Attorney and advised of his rights. Defendant's statements, together with his testimony at the inquiry, were used by the State at his trial. On appeal, the court found that the record of the events up to and including the inquiry did not reveal facts sufficient to establish the probable cause necessary to take defendant into custody. It concluded, however, that at the time of the inquiry, defendant was merely a possible source of information and was not a suspect. Accordingly, there was no need to give Miranda warnings at that time. Notwithstanding the insufficiency of the complaints, the court was satisfied that the magistrate had sufficient information to find that probable cause existed to hold defendant on two counts of murder. The court held that a towel with blood on it, although not described with sufficient particularity in the warrant, was lawfully seized and admitted in evidence as a means of committing a felony. Upon a review of the entire record of the case, the court concluded that defendant received a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

The federal court adopted its own reapportionment plan and created multi-senatorial districts in the state. The state citizens petitioned for a writ of quo warranto, which the court denied. The court held that the state citizens were not barred by res judicata from the federal action because they were not parties to that proceeding. The court held that N.D. Const. &sect; 29 violated the Equal Protection Clause because it attempted to freeze the representation of the state legislature regardless of future changes in a district's population and because the people would not have wanted a single-senatorial-district provision without permanently established district boundaries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court quashed the complaint charging defendant with the offense of driving a vehicle upon a city street while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. It reasoned that the arrest of defendant was illegal because it was made without a warrant. The police officer had arrested defendant in the evening at the scene of the accident. On appeal, the court ruled that double jeopardy was not an issue because defendant's motions precluded him from claiming protection under the Fifth Amendment. Also at issue was whether N.D. Cent. Code &sect; 29-06-15, which permitted a peace officer to make a warrantless arrest of a person suspected of driving or being in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages, applied to an arrest at night. The court ruled that it did. The intent of the legislature was clear, and it was aware that the greatest percentage of violations for that offense occurred at night.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant displayed and sold flags with seven red stripes and six white stripes, appearing alternately, which had a &quot;peace&quot; symbol in the blue field where the stars would be found on a U.S. flag. Consequently, defendant was charged with and convicted of desecrating a U.S. flag. On appeal, defendant contended that the flags at issue were peace symbols and not U.S. flags so that N.D. Cent. Code &sect;&sect; 12-07-04, -05 did not apply to them. The court agreed and reversed the conviction. The court opined that the purpose of &sect; 12-07-04 was to prohibit any disfiguration of the U.S. flag. It was the flag itself that the law sought to protect from desecration and not just any flag that happened to have a prevailing scheme of red and white stripes. The court ultimately found that defendant did not desecrate the U.S. flag or a representation of it, as the flags that defendant displayed were not U.S. flags and defendant did not represent them as such.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The companies were engaged in the business of selling, servicing, and installing water softeners in the city.

The companies commenced the instant declaratory judgment action to settle that question. The trial court held that the installation of water softeners did not constitute plumbing and was not a violation of state or local laws. On appeal, the court held that the word &quot;plumbing,&quot; as defined by North Dakota law, required the installation of water softeners and the pipes necessary for their operation to be done by licensed plumbers. Because the public health could be affected by the installation of water softeners, the business of installing water softeners could be regulated under the police power of the state.</SPAN></P>
