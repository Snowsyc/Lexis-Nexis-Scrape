</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant insurer challenged an adverse decree of the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) in its action to enjoin respondents, the Director of Revenue (Missouri) and the Superintendent of the Division of Insurance of the Department of Business and Administration of the State of Missouri, from collecting the two percent premium tax imposed upon it, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 148.370 (1949), for the year 1951.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurer argued that respondents should not be permitted to collect the two percent premium tax assessed for the year 1951 because certain portions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 148.370 (1949), the statute that authorized the tax, had been declared unconstitutional. The insurer took the position that the portions of &sect; 148.370 relating to an exemption for intangible personal property, which had been deleted due to unconstitutionality, were an integral part of the statute and thus the entire statute was invalid. Respondents argued that the stricken portions were severable and the remainder of &sect; 148.370 were still in force. On appeal, the court noted that it had jurisdiction pursuant to Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3 (1945). The court also held that, even assuming the entire &sect; 148.370 was invalid, respondents would still have the authority to collect the premium tax by virtue of a prior statute, 1945 Mo. Laws, p. 993, which had also authorized such a tax. The court noted that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 148.370 (1949) was enacted to repeal that prior statute. The court further noted that the rule was that when a repealing statute was invalidated, the prior general law was left unrepealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the circuit court's decree adverse to the insurer in its action to enjoin respondents from collecting the premium tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant car dealers sought to enjoin respondents Kansas City, Mayor of Kansas City, and the Kansas City Chief of Police from enforcing Kansas City, Mo., Ordinance 15794 &sect; 37-95 (August 22, 1952), which prohibited a dealer from keeping his business open on Sunday and six named national holidays. The car dealers sought review of the judgment from the Jackson Circuit Court (Missouri), which sustained the motion to dismiss brought by respondents.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the car dealers acknowledged the City's power to provide for the general welfare of the inhabitants by proper ordinances relating to Sunday closings of businesses, they argued that the ordinance was void because it was a special law and violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40. Under &sect; 40, the general assembly was prevented from passing any local or special law where a general law could be made applicable. The court noted that a test of a special law was the appropriateness of its provisions to the objects it excluded, not what the law included. The disputed ordinance excluded all persons engaged in the business of selling all commodities and all merchandise except automobiles. The court stated that there was no reasonable basis for singling out those people who were engaged in the business of selling automobiles and excluding those people who sold all other commodities and merchandise who were permitted to keep open their places of business on Sundays and the six named holidays. The trial court's grant of the motion to dismiss was in error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court judgment was reversed and the cause was remanded to the trial court with directions for it to enter a new judgment in conformity with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant landowners sought review of a judgment by the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which held that respondent pipeline company had the right to condemn the landowners' property. The appeal was assigned to a commissioner for an opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Both the landowners and the company contended that the appeal was properly taken to the court because title to real estate was involved and constitutional questions had been preserved for review. The commissioner, however, disagreed that the court had jurisdiction of the appeal. Although the state constitution required title to real estate to be involved to vest the court with appellate jurisdiction, it was not enough that title might be affected. The company did not dispute the title of the landowners to the property. The real question involved was whether Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 523.010 (1949) authorized the company to condemn land to lay its pipelines. The construction of the statute did not vest the court with appellate jurisdiction. The commissioner found that no constitutional question was preserved for review. The landowners' argument that &sect; 523.010 was unconstitutional if construed to include the company within its purview was not a direct challenge on the statute's constitutionality. Additionally, the landowners made no mention of any constitutional question in their motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court adopted the commissioner's opinion that it did not have jurisdiction of the appeal and transferred the cause to the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri) of molesting a minor in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 563.160 (1949). He appealed, arguing in part that his cross-examination was improperly restricted and that a certain jury instruction was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of molesting his nine-year-old niece. He admitted picking up his niece from school during her lunch hour, driving to a park and to a cemetery with her, and kissing her. He said he unbuttoned his top trouser button because his ulcers were bothering him, while the niece testified that he opened his pants, took her hand, and tried to make her &quot;do it.&quot; The court held that the trial court did not err in restricting defendant's cross-examination of the niece. It stated that the only restriction placed on the cross-examination was with reference to marital difficulties between the niece's parents, to which other witnesses testified. Next, the court held that the trial court was not required to instruct the jury that it had to find that the acts were done willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously. The court stated that &sect; 563.160 did not require such findings, only a finding that a person took indecent or improper liberties with a minor. Moreover, the court stated, the question of whether defendant took indecent liberties with the niece was for the jury, and there was ample circumstantial evidence supporting the State's version of events.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought review of an order of the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), which, under Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that his motion to quash should have been sustained because the information failed to state an offense under the laws of Missouri and because Mo.

The information charged that in the presence of the named seven-year-old minor (prosecutrix) defendant took indecent and improper liberties with the minor by exposing to her his private parts and having her rub the same with her hand and did thus annoy and molest the minor, contrary to statute. The court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 563.160 was sufficiently clear and definite in its terms and prohibitions, that the information stated an offense under the statute, and that &sect; 563.160 was not violative of any of the provisions of Mo.

The court found that evidence of events that occurred after the charged offense were admissible to establish not only the identity of defendant and a common scheme and plan as to the prosecutrix but also as corroborative evidence to show a disposition upon the part of defendant and as tending to support the specific offense for which he was on trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under information filed in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis (Missouri), defendant was charged with the felonious stealing of a car, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 560.165 (1949), and with two prior convictions under the habitual criminal act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The stolen automobile was found in a garage. On three occasions, defendant had paid and accepted the landlord's receipt for the rent on the garage. He put his own lock on the garage door, and the key to the lock was found in his pocket. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court refused to consider defendant's claim that the contents of the garage, which had been admitted into evidence, should have been suppressed because the evidence was obtained by an illegal and unreasonable search and seizure. Defendant had not raised his objection to the admission of the evidence in his motion for a new trial, and so the argument was not properly before the court. The court further held that double jeopardy did not bar application of the habitual criminal act because the act went only to the punishment, not the guilt or innocence of an accused of the offense on trial, and provided a greater punishment for a second or subsequent offense on account of the persistence of the accused in perpetrating crimes. The punishment was not for the prior offense. Finally, the court found that the State had made a submissible case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The insurer issued a policy of liability insurance that named the commanding general of the Missouri State Guard as the insured. While the military reservist was driving a jeep that was the property of the Guard, he collided with an automobile. The accident victim instituted an action against defendants for a declaration that the policy covered the personal injuries and property damage that he sustained in the collision. The trial court entered a declaratory judgment in favor of the accident victim, and defendants appealed to the court. The court concluded that it did not have appellate jurisdiction in the case. The court found that the amount in dispute did not establish that it had appellate jurisdiction. The record did not affirmatively disclose that the accident victim had an interest in the policy that exceeded the amount that was required, and the mere chance that the accident victim would recover a judgment or settlement that exceeded the amount did not establish appellate jurisdiction. The court also found that the accident victim had not attacked 1943 Mo. Laws pp. 646, &sect; 4, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 15022.4 (1939), on the ground that it was inherently and wholly unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The issues were whether, under Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 29, the bill had become effective; and if so, whether under Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 52(a), it could at any time within 90 days after the assembly's final adjournment be suspended by referendum. It was argued that because the governor had not approved the bill prior to the recess, it was not a law passed by the assembly under Mo. Const. art. III. &sect; 29. The court held that a bill passed by the assembly was a law for the purposes of &sect; 29, and that the fact that the governor did not approve the bill until after the beginning of the recess did not arrest its becoming effective 90 days after the beginning of the recess. It further held that although the bill was subject to referendum prior to its effective date, the filing of referendum petitions within 90 days of the assembly's final adjournment was untimely because the only reasonable construction of the two provisions was that laws were subject to referendum if petitions were duly filed before their effective date, which under the provisions of &sect; 29 was either 90 days after adjournment of the session or 90 days after the beginning of a recess and by joint resolution.</SPAN></P>

The Board of Equalization of St. Louis County (board) assessed property taxes upon that land. The trial court affirmed the lower regulatory agency's ruling that the property tax assessment was void because the property was exempt from taxation. The court affirmed. The court held that Mo.

It merely purchased a plant located on its land. The plant was rented to a private corporation and later sold to that corporation. This corporation was operating a manufacturing business in the plant. The city at no time attempted to operate the plant; it was, however, the owner of the real property sought to be taxed.

Ann. Stat. &sect; 549.170 (1949).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After being convicted of blackmail, a felon was granted a parole. Following a final discharge from parole, he applied for and was registered as a voter. Eight years later, his registration was cancelled by the board of election commissioners because he had not received a full pardon from the governor. On appeal to the circuit court, the judge ordered that the felon be permitted to vote. The commissioners sought further review, arguing that the judicial parole statute, Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 549.170, encroached upon the governor's power of pardon, in violation of Mo. Const. art. III (1875) and Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 8 (1875). In rejecting the commissioners' argument, the court ruled that Mo. Ann. Stat. &sect; 549.170 was not unconstitutional. Its application for more than 50 years was persuasive of its constitutionality and it did not deprive the governor of any of the pardoning power. Rather, the legislature had wide discretion under Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state filed original actions in prohibition against the members, alleging that the members were without jurisdiction to receive declarations for nomination for senator from the districts laid out under a county resolution and to conduct senatorial elections pursuant to that resolution because the resolution violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 8. The court issued a preliminary writ of prohibition, and held that the preventative power of a writ of prohibition was not limited to the supervision of courts but could, where the action sought to be prohibited was judicial in its nature, be exercised against public officers. It would not lie against judicial officers if the act sought to be prevented was not in itself judicial. A ministerial officer or board that obeyed a statute, ordinance, or resolution did not thereby determine its validity and prohibition did not lie to prevent the officer or board from obeying such statute, ordinance, or order. Here the members were following their duty under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 113.010-113.420 in conducting the elections; therefore their acts were ministerial and could not be controlled by prohibition. The court discharged the preliminary rule.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relators contended that the Commission had no jurisdiction to conduct the primary election and general election and that respondents had no jurisdiction to receive declarations for nomination from the nine purported districts because Ordinance 119 was unconstitutional and void, in that the districts were (1) not contiguous territory and (2) not as compact and nearly equal in population as could be. The court found that prohibition was not the proper remedy to determine whether the nine purported representative districts complied with Mo. Const. 1945, art. III, &sect; 3. The redistricting of St. Louis County into representative districts, as provided in art. III, was a legislative function. Although the Commission intended to receive declarations of candidacy and conduct the elections, their functions in accepting any declarations for nomination and in conducting the elections were purely ministerial, and prohibition would not lie.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The foreign state sued the trust company under an indenture of trust for taxes left unpaid after the probate estate in the foreign state of the decedent had been exhausted. The trial court held in favor of the foreign state. The trust company appealed, asserting that jurisdiction was proper because the case involved a constitutional question that was raised at the first opportunity. The court held that the mere assertion of issues involving a construction of the constitution did not serve to vest appellate jurisdiction in the court. The section of the constitution that had been violated had to be designated and the facts that constituted such violation had to be narrated. Averments of a general nature or legal conclusions did not present an issue involving the construction of the constitution so as to vest appellate jurisdiction in the court. Here, there was no express reference to the constitution contained in the record. Further, the foreign state's judgment was pleaded in the petition. Therefore, the trust company's first opportunity to raise a constitutional issue was in the answer. The court therefore lacked jurisdiction over the appeal and the cause was transferred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the corporation and the administratrix, challenged a decree and order from the Jackson Circuit Court (Missouri), which called for transferring the patent owned by appellants and respondent partner to a trustee to manage in the best interests of the parties. Only the portion of the distribution involving the patent was challenged in the equitable action to dissolve the corporation pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 351.485 (1949).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The partner had sought a receiver pendente lite to preserve the assets, the corporation's dissolution and liquidation, distribution of assets in accordance with the rights of stockholders, and appointment of a liquidating receiver to execute the court's orders. The parties had agreed to dissolution, that the corporation's dissolution expenses and liabilities be paid, and that cash and inventory had to be equally divided between them as the only two shareholders. The patent was for a standard and bracket for shelf supports. The court pointed out that the partner could not use an equitable action to save for himself the rights that he sought to destroy by bringing about the corporation's dissolution. The court rejected the provision of a trustee, especially one with power to sell the patent because that would amount to confiscation. The court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 351.490(3) made it mandatory that all remaining corporate assets be distributed between the shareholders, including the patent at issue. The court concluded that it was error for the trial court to undertake by judicial fiat to set up a trust as to the patent and affect a continuing receivership.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the trial court's decree and order of distribution by striking and eliminating provisions for a transfer of the parties' patent to a trustee and for the future ownership, use, licensing, sale, or management of the patent by a trustee. The court also modified the decree by adding a provision to require the liquidating receiver to transfer and assign the patent to the parties as co-owners. The judgment was affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>

An appellant challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance on the ground of unreasonableness as applied to its property had the burden of proving unreasonableness. In determining what was reasonable, much depended upon the requirements of the locality, and it was for the legislative body of the city to determine for itself what plan, rules, and regulations were necessary to promote the public health, safety, moral, and general welfare of its inhabitants. The court would not interfere unless the city had clearly acted unreasonably, and depreciation loss or loss of value, would not make a valid ordinance unreasonable.

Respondent real estate company approached the county in order for the owner to redeem at a much-reduced assessment. The collector approved and the delinquent tax indebtedness was substantially reduced. The trial court found that the collector had the authority to settle the tax indebtedness and vacated the foreclosure sale. On review, the court found the owner of the property never appeared, pleaded, or took any steps to defend the tax suit, or to redeem her tax delinquency over a period of more than a year after the default judgment of foreclosure was entered. Furthermore, she failed to redeem.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation and bar owner claimed that constitutional questions were involved in that the judgment resulted in a violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court found that no constitutional questions were involved. One question involved a determination of whether, as a matter of fact, the individual's first amended petition stated a new and additional claim against the original defendants. The other question was largely dependent upon a determination of the first question and involved at most only a construction of certain statutes and court rules. There was no contention by the corporation or the bar owner that any statute involved was unconstitutional. There was nothing involved but to determine whether the trial court correctly construed a petition as to contents and character. Any error committed in such construction was properly correctable on appeal. Thus, there was presented no constitutional question of being deprived of due process requiring or justifying an appeal to the Supreme Court of Missouri Division 1.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a county hospital's board of trustees, filed a declaratory action to determine the validity of the board's rule excluding osteopaths from practicing in the hospital. The board named as defendants medical physicians, the state medical association, osteopathic physicians, and the state osteopathic association. The Audrain Circuit Court (Missouri) declared the rule illegal. The board and the medical physicians appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that it had no jurisdiction over the appeal of the trial court's determination that a rule excluding osteopathic physicians from practicing in the hospital was illegal. The court rejected the argument that it had jurisdiction because of the medical physicians' assertion that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 337.010 was unconstitutional. That statute provided that osteopathy as taught and practiced by a certain school was not the practice of medicine and surgery. The medical physicians asserted that the statute was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the school. The medical physicians had no standing to challenge the statute's constitutionality, as they were not directly affected by it. The court did not have jurisdiction merely because the osteopathic physicians raised a constitutional question in their answer, as they abandoned it by not briefing it. The constitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 205.300, dealing with discrimination against practitioners of a school of medicine by a public hospital, was not at issue. Only the validity of the trial court's construction of that statute was attacked. The county hospital was not a political subdivision of the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that it was without jurisdiction of the appeal and transferred the matter to the court of appeals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The tax deed holder contended on appeal that the Land Trust Act was unconstitutional, that the city taxes were illegally assessed against the lot, and that the judgment of foreclosure was illegal and void and, therefore, the trial court erred in quieting the title in the owner. The court disagreed and affirmed the judgment in favor of the owner. The court found that the tax deed holder failed to preserve his claim that the Land Trust Act was unconstitutional and, therefore, the constitutionality of the Land Trust Act was not reviewable by the court. The court further found that the judgment was final and not interlocutory and that the tax deed holder had the option of appealing his claim in the tax foreclosure action brought separate and previously to the quiet title action brought by the owner. The court held that it was contemplated in the tax foreclosure action that there may have been an appeal from the judgment of foreclosure and, subsequently that there may have been an appeal from the order confirming or disapproving the sale, but that the tax deed holder failed to pursue any remedy available to him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs' action contested the consolidation of their school districts pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 165.657 and 15.707 (1949). The court had jurisdiction of the appeal pursuant to Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3 because a state officer was a party defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal because plaintiffs were not proper parties to bring the action. The school districts and their directors were not proper parties because the petition and briefs showed that they had been annexed into a district that was consolidated into the new district before they filed suit. Thus, they had no legal existence when they filed suit. An action for declaratory judgment was not available to the individual parties plaintiff, who were residents, patrons, and taxpayers of the reorganized district, because the attempted action was in the nature of a collateral attack on the corporate existence of the new district and only the state could question the corporate existence of the new district. The failure of the county prosecutor or the state attorney general to bring an action in quo warranto for that purpose did not authorize the individuals to maintain such an action.</SPAN></P>

Appellee assessed tax against appellants based on the installment payments received during 1946 on the basis that appellants earned interest on the deposit with the companies. The lower court affirmed. Appellants asserted on appeal that the installments are not subject to taxation because the interest did not stem from independent agreements of deposit, but from the insurance policies. The court found appellants' argument unmeritorious because the right to receive installment payments constituted an interest, however the court reversed and remanded because the Intangible Personal Property Tax Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 146.101-146.130 (1945), was not enacted until July of 1946 and the tax of appellants for the entire year of 1946 was impermissible under Mo. Const., art.

The Comptroller had refused to certify for payment the amounts in the requisition. The court held the Board was entitled to the relief sought, finding that: (1) the provisions of Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The party member contended that the Socialist party had a right to have challengers and watchers at the polls during general elections in St. Louis. He argued that &sect; 118.510, which limited such right, was unconstitutional under both the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The trial court declared that the statute was constitutional. In reversing, the court determined that the statute did not violate Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 25 because it did not infringe upon a voter's right to case his vote without restraint or coercion. However, the statute did violate the equal protection provisions of both the Missouri and United States Constitutions. The difference in treatment of political parties in St. Louis and elsewhere in the state was arbitrary and without any reasonable basis. The court recognized that the legislature was allowed to fix reasonable standards on watchers and challengers. However, &sect; 118.150 did not fix any standards; it merely conferred the privilege of having watchers and challengers on the two largest political parties. Because the statute would not have conveyed the legislature's intent without the unconstitutional provision, the entire statute was struck down.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers claimed that the tax of one dollar on the $ 100 assessed valuation, which was assessed by the school district without a vote of the electors of that school district, was unconstitutional. They claimed that under Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 11(b) only school districts formed of cities and towns could be taxed one dollar on the $ 100 assessed valuation. They argued that their school district was not an incorporated town and that therefore it was not a &quot;town&quot; under art. X, &sect; 11(b) and they should have been taxed only sixty-five cents on the $ 100 assessed valuation. The trial court upheld the tax and denied the taxpayers an injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the school district in question was a &quot;town&quot; within the meaning art. X, &sect; 11(b). The court ruled that it was not necessary that the town be incorporated in order to be a &quot;town&quot; within the meaning of the constitution. The court also found that the part of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 165.010 (1949) which referred to incorporated towns was in conflict with Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 11(b) and therefore was unconstitutional, but that the remainder of the statute was valid.</SPAN></P>

The Cape Girardeau Court of Common Pleas (Missouri) sustained plaintiff's motion and defendants sought review.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants contended that plaintiff failed to make a submissible case under the humanitarian doctrine and that the trial court erred in sustaining plaintiff's limited motion for a new trial. The court held that plaintiff made a submissible case because there was substantial evidence that defendants saw or with the highest degree of care could have seen plaintiff in a position of imminent peril and avoided the collision, but negligently failed to do so. The court noted that plaintiff testified that although she saw defendants' car one-half to three-fourths of a block east of the intersection, she assumed that she had plenty of time to cross the intersection and that she did not realize the proximity of defendants' car until the collision was imminent. The court also noted defendants' admission that the driver had seen plaintiff's car before it entered the intersection and continuously thereafter. The trial court properly sustained plaintiff's motion for a new trial for inadequacy of the verdict because her injuries did permanent damage to her health, aggravated her preexisting infirmities, and kept her from her profession.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the action of the corporation was not contrary to the shareholder's constitutional rights. On appeal the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the issuance of the preferred stock did not violate the shareholder's constitutional rights because shareholders owning more than 75 percent of the shares of the corporation's stock voted to accept the general corporation code, which meant the general law that was then in force; (2) preferred stock was authorized to be issued pursuant to &sect; 56 of the Corporation Act, Mo.

The court found that county courts, in passing upon petitions for incorporation or disincorporation, were not performing a judicial function of a court but are only determining whether the intended application contained the required elements.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the prosecution did not establish a statutory violation, and that &sect; 11785 violated defendant's rights under the United States and Missouri Constitutions. Defendant secured no relief. The evidence showed that defendant did not comply with its statutory obligation to pay the employee while he voted. Section 11785 did not violate defendant's rights under the Due Process Clause because the statute was a permissible exercise of the state's police power. The statute was not so arbitrary or unreasonable as to violate due process requirements. The statute did not violate defendant's equal protection rights because it operated alike on all employers, and the statute was reasonably related to the achievement of its objectives. Defendant's freedom of contract was always qualified by valid exertions of the state's police powers, such as &sect; 11785. Defendant failed with its allegation that the adoption of &sect; 11785 violated the legislative caption requirement of Mo. Const. art.

Defendant's admitted possession of the recently stolen property tended to show that he was guilty of the burglary. Such evidence, together with defendant's explanation of possession, was for the jury's consideration. The trial court did not err in receiving into evidence copies of the records of defendant's prior convictions and sentences. The copies were certified by the proper officials and were authenticated in accordance with the provisions of 28 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 1738 and 1739.

The court held that the evidence was substantial and sufficient to justify the submission of the question of defendant's guilt to the jury. The charge was supported by substantial evidence, and the credibility of the witness was for the jury.

Defendant objected to the trial court's instruction on insanity limiting the defense to defendant's ability to know right from wrong. The doctrine of &quot;volitional insanity&quot; or &quot;irresistible impulse&quot; was not recognized in Missouri. Defendant alleged that the so-called &quot;right and wrong&quot; rule was unconstitutional. The orderly administration of justice required a rule or test of the degree of insanity that excused. The rule in force in Missouri was adopted in M'Naghten's Case in 1843. All who came within the rule were entitled to acquittal on any criminal charge. The court held that the test of insanity as applied by the courts of Missouri did not violate due process or equal protection. Testimony on the issue of self-defense was that defendant and victim were engaged in a continuing feud, and that when defendant struck he did so not in lawful self-defense, but in vengeance. The trial court did not err in refusing to instruct on self-defense. Defendant had a fair trial. The evidence amply supported the verdict. The jury, in its discretion, fixed his punishment at death in full compliance with law.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in rejecting evidence that the contemplated use of land sought to be taken by eminent domain was not a &quot;public use&quot; because the necessity and expediency of the proposed taking were legislative and political, not judicial, questions, and the facts relied upon were matters of common knowledge about which the court was required to take judicial notice. The taxpayers failed to rebut the presumption that the proposed purposes of the ordinance were public purposes. It was common knowledge that vehicular traffic in the city had increased exponentially, street parking disrupted the movement of traffic, and off-street parking tended to facilitate traffic and avoid hazards to life and property.

Laws 500, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 5563.17 (1939). The circuit court ordered the corporation to issue a new stock certificate of an amount fixed by the court evidencing right of ownership of corporate stock.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The corporation contended that Section 17 of the Uniform Stock Transfer Act contemplated a bond protecting the corporation or any person injured from any liability in any amount. The court agreed with the corporation and affirmed the judgment. The testator's corporate stock certificate had been issued in 1925 and destroyed sometime in 1932. The bank sought the new certificate to prove ownership of the stock. The court held that Section 17 contemplated the giving of a bond in an amount of indemnity or penalty of any amount, not an amount fixed by the court. Section 17 did not expressly provide that a court in its discretion might fix the amount of the bond, nor did it say that the indemnity of the bond could be in any stated amount. However, the bond was expressly for the purpose of protecting the corporation from any liability or expense incurred by reason of the original certificate remaining outstanding. The court held that the absence of the use of the phrase &quot;in its discretion,&quot; or its equivalent, in the first sentence of Section 17 indicated an absence of legislative intent that the indemnity of the bond should be in any stated sum to be fixed by a court in its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The attorney general sought to compel the members to prepare and publish a financial statement of the county. The court granted a peremptory writ. The duty imposed on the members under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 13827 and 13828 (1939), Mo. R.S.A., to prepare and publish a financial statement was mandatory. The attorney general, both because of his statutory and common law powers, was a proper party to bring an action for the state that involved public rights and sought enforcement of public duties and that would prevent injury to the general welfare. Thus, the attorney general properly brought the action, and the petition was sufficient without further allegations on the matter. Moreover, even though all income collected and anticipated for the county for 1949 had been obligated, nevertheless, the cost of preparation and publication of the statement was a prior charge over other items in the budget, including the members' compensation, not directed by the legislature to be included therein. Furthermore, the statutes were constitutional and valid in imposing upon the members the duties of having prepared and published annually a detailed financial statement of the county.</SPAN></P>

The fire district urged that its right to tax that part of its territory, which was annexed to the city, was unconstitutionally deprived by the Act of June 3, 1947, &sect; 32a, 1947 Mo. Laws (Act). The Act, which amended an existing law, excluded territory from such a fire district when such territory was taken into a city with a population of 450,000 or more, as was the case with the subject city. County judges refused to extend taxes levied by the fire district to that part thereof annexed by the city. The court modified the judgment below, regarding application of the Act to the 1949 tax year, and affirmed the judgment so modified. The court held that the Act was not unconstitutional as an attempt to create an additional class of counties in violation of Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 8 (1945). Nor was it a statute regulating the affairs of counties within the meaning of Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 40, para. 21 (1945). Nor was it a local or special law where a general law could have applied. Also, the classification of cities therein, based on population, was reasonable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court modified the judgment entered below, as to the authority of the district to tax tangible property for a certain tax year in that part of its district which had been annexed to the city. Accordingly, to that extent modified and, as modified, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Certain teachers that joined the union did not have their contracts renewed.

The court stated that no claim on which relief could have been granted to plaintiffs by way of injunction or damages against the remaining defendants was stated in counts I, III, and V, which were the only counts before the trial court when the motion for judgment on the pleadings was sustained. On the admitted facts, the teachers had no contractual, preferential, or statutory rights to continued employment. The existing contracts of employment were carried into effect, they were duly executed in all respects by the respective parties and they expired by lapse of time.

Defendants asserted that the order of respondent, as entered, was an excessive exercise of judicial authority, and should have designated the specific documents sought to be produced. The court held that the order evidenced an excessive, unreasonable, and oppressive exercise of judicial authority beyond the jurisdiction of respondent. The order to produce documentary evidence at a deposition was too general and all conclusive to be valid, and failed to describe sufficiently the documents to be produced.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Relators alleged in their class action suit against certain union officials that they were not required to exhaust all the remedies prescribed by the union constitution and by-laws as that remedy was inadequate.

The court modified its alternative writ of mandamus and ordered respondent to exercise jurisdiction. The court held that the facts of the case were disputed: the factual effect of the union by-laws and whether the remedies afforded thereby were adequate, or complicated, dilatory and expensive. Thus, respondent had judicial discretion over an issue of fact, which could not be controlled by mandamus. The court held further that respondent erred in holding he had no jurisdiction of the case; he had jurisdiction to determine whether the union remedies were inadequate or not.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The cities both attempted to annex land. Kansas City amended its city charter with the mayor's approval to include the territory on September 3, 1946, and North Kansas City amended its charter with the electors' approval on September 10, 1946. Both cities alleged that it had exclusive municipal jurisdiction over the territory. The court held that Kansas City had exclusive municipal jurisdiction over the territory because Kansas City effectively amended its city charter to extend its territory before North Kansas City amended its charter, and thereby acquired the contested territory. The court held that the amendment process was authorized under Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 20. Moreover, the court found that the proposed annexation was not oppressive, unfair, or unreasonable. The court rejected North Kansas City's argument that Kansas City's annexation &quot;encircled&quot; North Kansas City. Also, the court found that Kansas City was prepared to and could substantially benefit the territory. Accordingly, the court issued an order of ouster against North Kansas City.</SPAN></P>

In the three cities, the attorneys asserted that they were entitled to recover $ 45,000,000. They also prayed to cancel the theater licenses. The circuit courts dismissed the petitions as unconstitutional because they were local and special in nature. On review, the court held that an action to recover statutory penalties must be strictly and literally construed. The court held that the statutes were unconstitutional because they were local and special in violation of Mo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 53 and art. III, &sect; 40.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owners' evidence showed that the value of their land would be less for residential purposes than for retail business; their property, however, had remained vacant for more than 40 years and, even though in an area zoned for business for 25 years, no business had ever been established. The amendment conformed the rezoned property to the rest of the district, which was residential. The court held that the challenged amending ordinance was not arbitrary and unreasonable but did have a reasonable relation to the public health, safety, and welfare. The property owners did not show that the procedure followed did not comply with zoning ordinance requirements. The property owners' evidence showed that the general committee of the city council had several hearings on the amendment and gave the property owners an opportunity to be fully heard. Thus, their own evidence did not sustain their charge that the city merely went through a formality of compliance. The important steps were notice, public hearing, and favorable recommendation, all of which were shown by the property owners' evidence. The court, therefore, held that the amending ordinance was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor's mother was the fourth wife of the minor's father. The will of the mother's father stated, in part, that all the net income of a trust was to be paid monthly to her son, if and so long as he shall live, and otherwise, or thereafter, to his issue. Because the trustees alleged that the minor was not the lawful issue of his father due to the marriage between the minor's father and mother being void, the minor, by his father as his next friend, filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to establish that he was the lawful issue of his father. The trial court ruled that the minor was not his father's lawful issue because his father's divorce from a previous wife was not final when the father married the minor's mother. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case. The court held that because the minor's father and mother believed in good faith that there was no obstacle to their marriage, the marriage was deemed voidable only, and not void, and the minor was legitimate and could inherit as a legal heir of his father.</SPAN></P>

Upon such payment, plaintiffs were ordered to make a conveyance of the land to defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found that the land was included in various conveyances to plaintiffs by mutual mistake and that defendants were entitled equitable relief. Plaintiffs, on appeal, contended that the trial court erred in permitting parol evidence of the intention of the parties to the conveyances. Plaintiffs asserted that the intention of the parties to the deed had to be gathered from the language of the instrument and aided where necessary by the surrounding circumstances. Plaintiffs further contended that the relief of reformation on the ground of mistake was not available because the mistake was not in the writing embodying the contract but was of an extrinsic fact which, had it been known, would have probably induced the parties to make a different contract. The court found that the relief of complete recission and cancellation would not have been equitable to plaintiffs as the parties could not have been completely restored to their former positions. However, the court found that plaintiffs should not have been permitted to profit by the mistake whereby they were conveyed land they had no expectation of acquiring. The court found the chancellor ordered the proper relief.</SPAN></P>

The city police retirement system board twice denied the beneficiary's claim, and she then brought an original and independent action before the lower court. The state brought a proceeding in prohibition before the court, questioning the jurisdiction of the lower court to entertain the beneficiary's action. The court found that under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9468(6), the board of trustees of the city police retirement system was given exclusive original jurisdiction in such matters as the beneficiary's claim. The board was considered a quasi-judicial body. The court also found that the statute provided for review of the board's decisions by the common law writ of certiorari only, with right of appeal from the reviewing court. The court found that this provision for review conflicted with Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 22 because common law certiorari would not bring the entire record to the reviewing court and would offend due process.</SPAN></P>

Laws 431, &sect; 11412, which imposed a two percent use tax on motor vehicles required to be registered in Missouri, and upon which the two percent sales tax was not paid to the State. The corporation prayed for a writ requiring respondent State officials to issue it a certificate of title for a truck-tractor purchased in North Carolina.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The officials took the corporation's petition as a petition for an alternative writ and thereupon, the officials filed their return. The corporation then filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The corporation had purchased the truck-tractor in North Carolina and then had the vehicle driven to Missouri. It applied for the title and tendered the proper fees. No sales tax was paid to Missouri, and the vehicle was not registered in any other state. The officials refused to issue the title because the corporation refused to pay the tax. The court found that the use tax on vehicles was legitimately connected and related to the subject of sales taxes; thus, the complementary use tax on motor vehicles that was enacted as an amendment of a same purpose Sales Tax Act did not violate the constitution. However, the tax levied was not uniform upon the same class of subjects because there was no rational basis for exempting the purchasers of motor vehicles with a seating capacity of 10 or more passengers from payment of the tax. The court could not strike the exemption from the law because to do so would have broadened the scope of the Act. As such, a peremptory writ issued.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ordered that a peremptory writ of mandamus issue against the officials.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bond election was held prior to the annexation's effective date, and the members relied primarily on the unconstitutional deprivation of their right to vote at the bond election.

When the members sought review, a quo warranto proceeding was pending that squarely presented the question of the amendment's validity. On review, the court approved the issuance and sale of the bonds but reserved a decision on the annexation issue for the quo warranto proceeding. It held that the county residents did not immediately become qualified city electors on the adoption of the annexation amendment and that the members were liable for their proportionate share of the city's debts after the annexation's effective date. The court found no constitutional or statutory provision governing the adjustment of pre-existing rights and liabilities based on an annexation but held that the silence of those authorities required application of the general rule.</SPAN></P>

The court had made a preliminary ruling on the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 8473 to 8478 (1939) vested in the county courts exclusive authority to establish and maintain public roads. Under the new Missouri Constitution adopted in 1945, county courts were administrative bodies entirely without judicial power. Relators contended that the new constitution rendered the applicable statutes invalid because the establishment of public roads was a judicial function. The court recently held that the authority to establish a road meant judicial action which, under the new Constitution, a county court could not perform, meaning that the county courts could not invoke eminent domain for purposes of county roads. The court did find that the question of public necessity was within the jurisdiction of the county court because the propriety and necessity for the location of a public road was a legislative and not a judicial question. The preliminary rule was hereby modified and made permanent so as to prohibit respondents from rendering a judgment or making an order purporting to divest relators of their title, and from taking possession of relators' lands until title had been acquired by voluntary conveyance or by valid judgment in condemnation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county's electors voted to support county libraries with a one-mill levy. The statutes relating to the taxation of a utility's distributable property did not mention the support of libraries as a purpose for which the tax could be collected. The statutes provided that the utility's property was subject to taxation for state, county, municipal, and other local purposes. The State Constitution and statutes specifically authorized the support of libraries by taxes. Another statute provided that library taxes were to be levied and collected in the same manner as rural school district taxes. That had been done in this case. The State Tax Commission certified the assessment of the utility's property to the county and the county was attempting to collect the tax. The court held that even though the library tax was not mentioned in the statutes relating to taxation of the utility's distributable property, when read in connection with the provisions relating to libraries, they plainly authorized the assessment, apportionment, and levy of the library tax against the utility's property.</SPAN></P>

The United States Supreme Court stated banks were subject to state laws and could take any action allowed by that law that did not conflict with federal law or interfere with the bank's duties to the government.

The owners alleged that the levy was void because the laws that governed the district when it was organized did not authorize a second assessment. The owners alleged that in a previous case the court had found that the same bonds were void. At the time of the original assessment, the county court had the authority and responsibility to make an adequate assessment to pay the bonds in full. The county courts were also authorized to make supplemental assessments when needed under Mo. Rev.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At the outset it had to be determined whether the court had appellate jurisdiction of the cause under Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3 (1945), on one or another of three theories, or whether that jurisdiction was in the St. Louis Court of Appeals. The questions were: (1) whether the city was acting merely as a municipal corporation in bringing and prosecuting the suit, or was acting in its capacity as a county under art. VI, &sect; 31, (2) whether the title to real estate was involved within the meaning of art. V, &sect; 3, or, (3) whether a constitutional question was raised below and kept alive, so as to make the court the appellate forum under art. V, &sect; 3. The court found that the city was acting as a municipal corporation and not as a county, in maintaining the suit, and that art. V, &sect; 3, gave the court appellate jurisdiction in civil cases only when the city was a party in its character as a county. As to the second ground, the title to real estate was not involved, though it could have been affected by the outcome. Thirdly, the court was unwilling to hold that merely because the case involved a question of eminent domain, that it also presented a constitutional question.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that defendant could not successfully urge error in the admission of testimony when defendant first brought that line of evidence before the jury. The court also stated that defendant's due process rights were not violated because due process of law was not involved where the suggestions of counsel for defendant apparently provoked statements by counsel for the State.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an original proceeding in prohibition the State, at the relation of relator railroad company, sought to prohibit respondent judge from proceeding in a case brought by train porters asking declaratory and injunctive relief. The question for decision was whether the courts of the State had jurisdiction to act in a controversy between the porters and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen under the Railway Labor Act (Act), 45 U.S.C.S. &sect; 151 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The controversy between the porters and the Brotherhood concerned which employees, the porters or brakemen, were entitled to jobs designated &quot;passenger brakemen-baggagemen&quot;. The porters claimed that the purpose of the dispute was to deprive them of job functions because of their race and color. A circuit court order a temporary injunction enjoining the railroad company from displacing from their job functions the porters and others similarly situated. The porters were African Americans, while the brakemen were Caucasians. The court held that: (1) under the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, no court had authority to decide that the Brotherhood did or was required to represent train porters; (2) such a question was not one of a jurisdictional dispute determinable under the administrative scheme set up by the Act; (3) the question was not restricted by the Act to voluntary settlement by recourse to the traditional implements of mediation, conciliation, and arbitration; and (4) the courts were without power to review the Brotherhood's certification to represent certain workers as decided by the National Mediation Board (United States) in accordance with &sect; 152 of the Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court made the rule absolute to prohibit the judge from making any determination or order concerning jurisdictional, classification, or representation issues, or from declaring the porters' status or rights as to any position or job functions. In all other respects, the court discharged its rule. The court dissolved the temporary injunction except as to enjoining taking away from the porters their present job functions or replacing them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county issued road bonds to construct a county-wide road system. A strip of land in the city was condemned by the county for a connecting road. The city later enacted an ordinance vacating the highway easement over the strip of land. The property owner's lot was adjacent to the part of the highway that the city sought to vacate. Although the road system had been improved over a period of years, the strip of land had not yet been paved. On appeal of the judgment holding the ordinance invalid, the court noted that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 8608 gave the county the power to &quot;make&quot; a street or road in any incorporated city or village and to pay for the same out of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds. Under &sect; 8608, the county had the power in the construction or improvement of any road between two points in the county to make a street in an incorporated city, when such street was a part of the county highway system. Therefore, the county had the power to construct the street in the city. The fact that a road of a state highway system went through a municipality did not make it the property of the municipality. The street was not the property of the city and it had no power to vacate it.</SPAN></P>

The taxicab driver contended it was error for the trial court to refuse to give his tendered declaration of law that stated that the words &quot;intoxicating beverages&quot;, did not include wine to be used solely for medicinal and not for beverage purposes. The court rejected the taxicab driver's contention and found that all the state had to prove was that it was immaterial what use the ultimate purchaser intended to make of the wine, the sole question under the ordinance being whether the wine was an intoxicating beverage while in the possession of the taxicab driver. The court also ruled the ordinance under which the taxicab driver was convicted was a valid enactment, and was constitutional. However, the court held the evidence did not support the judgment finding the taxicab driver guilty of transporting liquor, but did support a finding of guilt of possession of liquor and modified the judgment accordingly.

A circuit court's interlocutory decree declared the incorporation of the district subject to an election in the district. The vote was in favor of incorporation and the issuance of bonds. The circuit court then entered a final decree of incorporation of the district. A board of directors passed a resolution for the issuance of the bonds of the district. The bonds were tendered to the Auditor, who refused to register them on the grounds that the act under which the bonds were purportedly authorized, 1947 Mo. Laws 432, was unconstitutional in that it delegated legislative powers to the circuit court and it delegated legislative powers to private individuals. The court noted that the provisions of the act were general and it was left to the court to determine if the described conditions precedent to incorporation were complied with; therefore, there was no delegation of legislative power. The court also held, as it did with a nearly identical predecessor law, that it did not delegate to private citizens the power to create a political subdivision.</SPAN></P>

The attorneys claimed the reasonable value of the services to be 5 percent of the total fund collected, making the fee in each case in excess of $ 130,000. The circuit court dismissed the petitions. The court affirmed. The court held that the only authority given to the circuit court by &sect; 5985(a) was the authority to determine whether the fund, or any part thereof, belonged to any person or corporation making claim therefor. The word &quot;claim,&quot; as used in the statute, was evidently used in such a restricted sense. The court held further that the legislature, had it intended to vest the circuit court with such jurisdiction to allow the attorneys' claims to the fund, would have said so in plain and unmistakable language.

The owner denied that she was using her property for storage of scrap iron or junk and asserted that the particular clause of the ordinance invoked against her was unconstitutional. The court rejected the owner's constitutional argument and stated that the provision of the ordinance, which prohibited the storage of scrap iron and junk in certain defined districts was not entirely unconnected within the broad purposes of Mo.

In fact, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4904 (1939) and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 4908 expressly gave a city the right to pass ordinances for the regulation and control of the sale of intoxicating liquors within the city not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act.

The tavern owners argued that the Liquor Control Act preempted the field of liquor legislation, both as to intoxicating and non-intoxicating liquor, to such an extent as to have left little power of regulation in the cities. The trial court refused to enjoin the ordinances. The court affirmed. Under Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A special election was previously held in the township and two others adjoining, as a unit, under Mo. Rev.

Relators asserted that the judges were attempting to enable the township to &quot;secede from the union&quot; of the three townships established at the earlier election. Relators maintained that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14470a, recently enacted, was void because it violated Mo. Const. art. III, &sect; 23. 1947 Mo. Laws 14470a was an amendment of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 14470a (1945). The court stated that the amendment was not a repeal of the stock law. The amendment gave voters that had already voted to restrain live stock the option to then petition for and have an election on the question of whether to allow the animals to run at large. While 1947 Mo. Laws 14470a was not unconstitutional on the grounds assigned, relators' petition to the county court did not justify respondents in calling the election because it did not have the required number of signatures.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the lower court's judgment, concluding that the statute of limitation had not run against taxes with respect to the years at issue. Litigation had been commenced for each year that taxes were due. As to the owner's offer to buy his land, the lower court was not required to accept it under the Land Tax Collection Act, Mo. Rev.

The act was constitutional and did not violate due process because the owner's right to a hearing, among other safeguards, was provided for.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The construction company brought an action to recover for labor and material furnished in the reconstruction of the candy company's building. A referee found in favor of the construction company. The trial court overruled the candy company's exceptions to the referee's report. On appeal, the candy company claimed that the court should review the case de novo on both the law and the evidence. The construction company claimed that the court was bound by the finding of the referee as confirmed by the trial court, stating that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 114 requiring a review of the law and the evidence applied only to cases tried by the court and not to cases tried by a referee. On the merits, the construction company based its claim on quantum meruit, while the candy company claimed that the construction company should be restricted to the contract price. The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that: (1) the spirit and letter of the law required that it review de novo all non-jury cases; and (2) in light of the numerous changes to the contract, the referee was justified in finding that the contract was abandoned and determining the controversy on a quantum meruit basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff partners appealed a judgment of the Circuit Court of City of St. Louis (Missouri), which dismissed their complaint against defendants, city, mayor, public safety director, building commissioner, police chief, and fire marshall. The partners claimed that an order closing a theater and condemning it under the Building Code, City of St. Louis, Mo., Ordinance No. 43,114 ( April 5, 1945), unconstitutionally deprived them of the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The partners' movie theater was condemned as a fire hazard and the building was ordered torn down unless they made it safe in conformity with the new building code. The partners sought an order against defendants enjoining them from closing the theater or demolishing the building, but the trial court dismissed their complaint. On appeal they claimed that they were unconstitutionally deprived of their property. The court affirmed the judgment below insofar as it dismissed the complaint and permitted the closing. The court ruled that the building code was not unconstitutional. It provided specific parameters within which defendants were permitted to operate. Further, the regulation of theaters to protect the public from fire was a valid exercise of the police power and the city had ample authority to abate a business that was detrimental to the health or welfare of the citizens. The lack of substantial evidence with regard to the removal of the building meant that the judgment below permitting the building to be torn down was arbitrary and not justified. It was thus not within the lawful authority conferred by the building code, and the court reversed that part of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that dismissed the partners' complaint and permitted the closing of their theater. The court also reversed that part of the judgment that permitted the building to be torn down, and it remanded the cause to the trial court with directions to grant the partners' the injunction against the demolishing and removal of the building.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant school district appealed an order from the Circuit Court of Stoddard County (Missouri), which awarded judgment to plaintiff teacher on her cause of action to recover for warrants issued by the district as payment for the teacher's salary. The district challenged the trial court's striking of its defense that the warrants were invalid under former Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9233, 9257 (1929); Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 104545 (1939).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The teacher's contract with the district specified an agreed salary. The teacher continued to render her services during a period of seven months in which the district issued warrants in payment of her salary. When the warrants became due, payment was refused. The teacher filed her cause of action and the district asserted several defenses. The trial court struck one of the defenses and delivered judgment in favor of the teacher. On the district's appeal, the court held that the teacher's action was not time-barred because the 10 year statute of limitations from Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1013 (1939) was applicable to the district's warrants. The teacher was entitled to interest on the warrants because her claim had been reduced to a judgment. The notation of &quot;payment when notified&quot; on the warrants was improper and did not require the teacher to await for notification from the district before pursuing her claim. The district was not permitted to avoid its obligations based on Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 12 (1875) and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 9233 (1929) and the failure of State and local income. The judgment did not necessarily entitle the teacher to collect from the indebted district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim filed three actions against the corporation in a Missouri circuit court. The stockholder was a New Jersey corporation and had its principal place of business in New York City.

The attachment levies followed the procedure prescribed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 1345, 1346, and 1457 (1939), which authorize such an attachment at the office of the corporation without actual seizure of the stock certificates themselves. The stockholder filed a motion to quash, which was denied. It then filed proceedings in prohibition, which were consolidated. The court issued writs of prohibition to determine the question of jurisdiction. The court discharged the writs. The Act did not change the nature of the property in shares of stock. Stock certificates remained a title document, not the property itself. The situs was in the state of the corporation's domicile.

However, the clerk had not gotten approval from the courts, as was required by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 3633, 3635. Further, the rebinding was done without proper estimating and budgeting, as was required by Mo. Rev. Stat. Ch.73, art. 2. Thus, payment was refused. The company filed an action to recover the expense, but the trial court found in favor of the county. The company appealed that judgment. On review, the court found that, under Mo. Const. Art. IV &sect; 48, all contracts had to be made with counties under the express authority of law. Further, Mo. Const. art. IV, &sect; 3349 provided that all contracts with political subdivisions, including the county, had to be in writing, regardless of the performance of the county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner operated a hotel. The buildings to the west all had the same front yard line. The property owner wanted to add retail stores in front of its hotel and applied to the building commissioner for a permit to build the structures. The commissioner denied the permit. The board of adjustment and the lower court affirmed the denial. The court reversed. The court held that the applicable ordinance, City of St. Louis, Mo., Ordinance 35003, &sect; 10, nowhere imposed a front yard building line upon a commercial use property located in a &quot;D&quot; Height and Area District, which was how the property owner's hotel was classified. Further, the board of adjustment had no power to impose such a building line on the property owner upon the theory that to do so would protect the general welfare. The ordinance did not make any front yard building line requirement at all. The board acted beyond its power when it rewrote the ordinance by imposing the front yard requirement on the property owner.</SPAN></P>

The prisoners were arrested for violations of &sect; 8 of the Madison Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 10178.208 (1947).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 8 provided that it was a misdemeanor for a person who was not an employee of an establishment to picket the employer when there was no labor dispute between the employers and its employees. Both prisoners were arrested for the peaceful picketing of establishments where they were not employed when there was not a labor dispute. The court agreed with the prisoners' assertion that the Act violated their right to free speech as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. I; U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1; and Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 10. Decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court established that peaceful labor picketing was protected as free speech. Section 8 of the Act did not purport to regulate picketing as a reasonable time, place, or manner restriction but sought to abolish picketing by a non-employee unless a labor dispute existed. Thus, &sect; 8 was unconstitutional and void. Additionally, the title of the Act, S.B. 79, 1947 Mo. Laws p. 355, failed to mention picketing as a regulated activity. Consequently, there was nothing in the title to give notice that the Act made all picketing a crime in the absence of a labor dispute. The prisoners' arrest was illegal, and they were entitled to release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the prisoners' petitions for habeas corpus relief from confinement and ordered that they be discharged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The informants initiated disbarment proceedings and charged an attorney with professional misconduct for conversion of funds held in a fiduciary capacity. The trial court found the attorney guilty and assessed punishment as a 90-day suspension. The informants appealed, contending that the judgment was inappropriate and inadequate and that a proper judgment should have been for the attorney's permanent disbarment. In modifying the judgment to impose a sanction of permanent disbarment, the court concluded that, at the time of the offense, the attorney was mature in experience and fully understood the nature of his wrongful act. It was not done suddenly or desperately but with deliberation, and the attorney's refusal to recognize the wrongful act or to accept responsibility for it had extended over a long period of time. The attorney knew that the money held by him belonged to another party and that he held it in a fiduciary capacity. Despite this knowledge, the attorney chose to treat the money as if it belonged to him. Attorney misconduct for the conversion of funds held in a fiduciary capacity justified counsel's disbarment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment of the circuit court was ordered to be modified to reflect a sanction of permanent disbarment, and the attorney was disbarred from the practice of law and his name ordered stricken from the roll of attorneys in the courts of the State of Missouri.</SPAN></P>

State law allowed ordinances taxing telephone companies, and defendant was clearly a telephone company. State constitution did not require that the ordinance be worded exactly the same as the ballot initiative to be valid. Although proposition was required to receive a two-thirds majority of city voters, this argument was not raised in defendant's brief, and therefore was not available for review.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants claimed that the Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission (MHTC) unlawfully voided their outdoor advertising permits on the basis that appellants misrepresented, in their applications to the MHTC for issuance of the permits, the zoning of their property as being commercial. Appellants contended that no such misrepresentation occurred in that, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Code &sect; 226.520(3), such permits were authorized for areas zoned &quot;industrial, commercial or the like,&quot; and their property, pursuant to a conditional use permit, was zoned &quot;like&quot; commercial. The court construed the statutory phrase at issue, &quot;or the like,&quot; as modifying the zoning designation of the subject property necessary for the exception of &sect; 226.520(3) to apply, (industrial or commercial), not the necessary act of zoning. The court held that appellants' property was not &quot;zoned&quot; commercial, as that term is generally used for the exception of &sect; 226.520(3) to be triggered. Judgment affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court granted respondents summary judgment on respondents' petition for judicial review of appellant commission's denial of their billboard permit application. On appeal, the court found that the Highway Beautification Act and the state regulation were not inconsistent, and in promulgating Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 7 &sect; 10-6.040(2)(A) (state regulation), appellant did not generate a rule that was beyond what was minimally necessary to secure receipt of federal highway funds. The state regulation was not illegal and void. It was clearly intended that the general common law definition of &quot;spot zoning&quot; did not apply for purposes of regulating outdoor advertising. Appellant was not required to consider the public benefit of the zoning of respondents' property. Respondents' property was spot zoned for outdoor advertising and it did not constitute a zoned commercial or industrial area for the purpose of outdoor advertising. Appellant properly denied respondents' billboard permit application.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants challenged the issuance of a permit to construct a sanitary landfill. Appellants argued the trial court erred in finding respondent Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) had not acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, or capriciously in the permit application, when the terms of the permit did not require a fence to be built, as state statute did, and in issuing the permit when the executive board review and comment had not occurred. Appellants further argued the trial court erred in concluding the time deadlines were merely directive, not mandatory. The court found that the permit expressly rejected any notion that the permit excused or demonstrated compliance with state laws. The court further found respondent MDNR's failure to comply with the time-limiting provisions, and the failure of the executive board to review and comment on the permit application, did not render the decision to issue the permit unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious.</SPAN></P>

The amendment also prohibited bank from issuing fractional shares. For every minority shareholder left with an interest in less than one share, the amendment provided for a cash payment for all pre-amendment shares. Appellants claimed that this was a taking of private property for private use without the consent of the owner in violation of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 28. The court could not find any taking of property without the owner's consent. Respondents' action was not a dissolution. Appellants, in their purchase of stock, consented to the actions of the majority shareholders to help the corporation operate more profitably. The reverse stock split was such an action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, including Laborers' District Council, brought an action challenging the City of St. Louis' (City) interpretation of the City Plumbing Code, City of Saint Louis, Mo., Ordinance 60826 (Code), and the constitutionality of the ordinance as interpreted. The City interpreted the Code to require private plumbing contractors installing public water mains to have plumbing licenses, but not city employees doing similar work. On appeal appellants contended that the public water main installation at issue did not fall within the scope or language of the Code, and that allowing the Code Official to impose such a requirement constitutes an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. The court affirmed, holding the lower court's interpretation of the Code was not clearly erroneous, and, under a rational basis analysis, appellants had not met their burden of showing the classification at issue did not rest on any reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

The court found that plaintiff state could rely on defendant's confession and evidence corroborating it, even evidence resulting from the confession, to prove the corpus delicti. Thus, the court held that the evidence corroborating defendant's confession was sufficient for admission of the confession to prove the corpus delicti. The court did not address defendant's argument regarding the breadth of the statute he was convicted under because he first raised the issue, which was too late.

Stat. &sect; 565.084. The court sentenced him and placed him on five years probation. On appeal, defendant claimed the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction of tampering with a judicial official under &sect; 565.084 because there was no judicial proceeding pending at the time defendant made his comments to the judge. He also claimed the statute was unconstitutionally vague, overbroad, and indefinite. The court held that &sect; 565.084 did not require proof that an official proceeding was pending at the time of the offense. Defendant's words to the judge were not a mere expression of his opinion or feelings. They were a threat aimed at a particular individual, the judge. Section 565.084 enjoined certain speech because of the impact it was intended to have on the person to whom it was directed. The plain meaning of the words of the statute was that it prohibited speech only to the extent that it offended the state's legitimate interest in securing its judicial proceedings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's employment as a police officer was terminated by respondent city. Appellant's appeal to the City Administrator was summarily dismissed. Appellant then filed a petition for review in circuit court, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.150. The circuit court treated respondent's motion for summary judgment as a motion to dismiss as well. The circuit court then granted summary judgment in favor of respondent and dismissed appellant's petition. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. Through its personnel manual, respondent made an implied promise that appellant's continued employment would not be terminated unfairly or in a discriminatory manner. Hence, appellant had a property interest in her continued employment that entitled her to sufficient notice of the reasons for her termination and an opportunity to present her side of the story to respondent before her employment could be terminated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant former employee sued respondents, employer and receiver, and claimed that he was fired in derogation of his employment contract and his civil rights. The trial court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over claims against respondent employer and transferred those claims to receivership court.

Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 375.670 and 375.1188, statutes that required the case to be litigated in receivership court were enforceable because the legislative purpose was reasonable and that appellant could not complain about assignment of case to receivership court given that he could only bargain with respondent employer under parameters set by liquidation provision of insurance code.

Appellant contended that his acts of transferring copies of altered documents merely consisted of promises as to future events and that he did not have any intent to defraud. On appeal, the court found that evidence that appellant had falsified insurance certificates in the past was relevant to prove that the forgery for which he was on trial was not a mistake. The court found that sufficient evidence was presented for the jury to infer that appellant had the intent to commit fraud because he transferred both the cashier's check and the certificate of insurance knowing that both were altered and contained false information, and that he did so with the implied intent that they be relied on. The court rejected appellant's other contentions as meritless. Accordingly, appellant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner state filed an information charging defendant with first degree assault, then filed a request for discovery.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court entered orders pendente lite for child support, attorney fees, and costs, from which appellant sought review, citing numerous errors. The court held that the appellant received all the process to which she was constitutionally entitled in the trial court's entry of its orders pendente lite for child support, attorney fees, and costs. Both parties were able to submit affidavits and court forms in support of their positions, and orders were only temporary. Because the trial court utilized a form that was not approved to calculate child support, the court remanded the action for a proper determination of the amount. The court also held that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's determination of necessity for the award of attorney fees and costs to respondent husband, and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in making the award. The court held that the trial court had authority to award temporary child support retroactive to the date the petition was filed, which was prior to the date challenged by appellant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in part, reversed and remanded in part, the trial court's orders pendente lite issued in a divorce proceeding. The court held that statute authorizing orders pendente lite was not unconstitutionally vague and that appellant was afforded proper due process. Because both parties filed affidavits, and various court-approved forms concerning the relevant issues, the court found these were sufficient to satisfy due process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his convictions from the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri), for drug trafficking in the second degree in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.223 (1994), alleging the drug court commissioner lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear his case, and Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 478.466 was unconstitutional because it violated the principle of separation of powers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of drug trafficking in the second degree, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 195.223 (1994), before a drug court commissioner. Appellant challenged the judgment and sentence, asserting the commissioner lacked jurisdiction to preside over his trial because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 478.466 (1996) was unconstitutional and violated Mo. Const. art. II, &sect; 1, and art. V, &sect;&sect; 1, 25(a). The state argued that there had been no final judgment from which to appeal and that the constitutionality issue was not timely filed. The court found the case had a final judgment from which to file an appeal because the commissioner's judgment was timely confirmed by the trial court. The court found the constitutional question was preserved for appeal because subject matter jurisdiction could be raised at any time. The fact that appellant raised this issue for the first time on appeal after the jury's verdict was immaterial. The court concluded that because the constitutionality of &sect; 478.466 was a &quot;real and substantial issue&quot; preserved for appeal, it did not have jurisdiction and transferred the case to the state supreme court pursuant to Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3 (amended 1976).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's case was transferred to the state supreme court because the constitutionality of the statute that conferred jurisdiction to a drug court commissioner was a &quot;real and substantial issue&quot; that the appellate court did not have jurisdiction to entertain. Appellant filed his appeal after he was convicted him of drug trafficking in the second degree but it was timely because subject matter jurisdiction question could be brought at any time.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought a refund from the fund through appellant revenue director, pursuant Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 319.100, et seq. (1994).

Appellant revenue director and appellant tank fund appealed the grant of the refund. The court affirmed the decisions of the AHC noting the AHC had jurisdiction to grant the refund. The AHC had jurisdiction to hear the case because appellant revenue director had authority, under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 414.102, to refund monies appellant oil company improperly paid to the tank fund. On the issue of interest, the court concluded there were no statutory provisions allowing such interest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Missouri Supreme Court transferred defendant's appeal after defendant's constitutional challenge was denied. Defendant was convicted of two counts of statutory sodomy, four counts of first degree child molestation, and two counts of furnishing pornographic material to minors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction to the supreme court, alleging the unconstitutionality of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.025, which transferred the case to this court after upholding the statute. Four errors were alleged. The prosecution did not contest that the evidence was insufficient to find defendant guilty on one count of child molestation. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.067.1 required touching of the victim's genitals or anus and touching the victim's buttocks did not satisfy the statute. The prosecution did not contest that there were erroneous verdict directors submitted on the counts of furnishing pornography to a minor. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 573.010(10) was amended and the verdict directors were not revised to match the statute, effectively reducing the prosecution's burden of proof, which was prejudicial error. The court affirmed the remaining convictions against the other alleged errors by summary order under Mo. R. Crim. P. 30.25(b) because there was no precedential value to analyzing those errors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The convictions for one of the counts of child molestation and both counts of furnishing pornography to a minor were reversed and new trial was ordered because the trial court committed prejudicial error.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant driver's truck was stopped by respondent city's police officers because appellant's license plates were expired. Appellant refused to leave his truck although ordered to do so twice by police officers. Instead, appellant proceeded to drive away. The officers chased appellant, and the chase ended when appellant's vehicle came to a stop in the driveway of his residence. After a trial, appellant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle with expired plates, two counts of failing to signal, and one count of hindering and interfering with a law enforcement officer by fleeing. Appellant sought review of his conviction. The court held the lower court correctly exercised jurisdiction over appellant since respondent was not an administrative agency, as argued by appellant. The court also held that respondent properly imposed fines for violations of its ordinances and that such an imposition was not unconstitutional under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 31. Appellant failed to argue and prove that respondent's ordinances, pursuant to which the police acted, were invalid. Thus, the court rejected appellant's argument that the ordinances were unconstitutional under Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellant sought review of the lower court's imposition of an order of stay and an order of impoundment under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 386.520.2. The appellant, a public utility, proposed tariffs with the respondent Missouri Public Service Commission (commission) and requested a rate increase. Several parties intervened and hearings were held at the conclusion of which the commission granted the appellant a rate increase significantly less that what the appellant requested. The appellant, the respondents, and the intervenors subsequently all became involved in various judicial proceedings. During one proceeding, the lower court entered the two orders of which the appellant complained. The appellant asserted that the lower court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the two orders because the statute allowed a circuit court to enter orders of stay and impoundment only when a rate decrease was involved. The court disagreed. The court held that the statute in question also applied to rate increases. The court therefore affirmed the lower court's orders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to enter the stay and impoundment orders.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Charles County, Family Court Division, (Missouri), which purported to convert the Findings and Recommendations for Judgment and Decree of Dissolution rendered by a Family Court Commissioner, via nunc pro tunc amendment, into a final judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband petitioned for dissolution of marriage from respondent. The action was heard by a family court commissioner who rendered findings and recommendations for judgment and decree of dissolution, which the trial court failed to adopt or confirm. When appellant sought review of the purported judgment, the appeal was dismissed for lack of a final judgment. In response to appellant's request for a hearing in the trial court, respondent filed a motion for nunc pro tunc in which she argued that the commissioner's decision should be designated a final judgment. The trial court granted respondent's motion, and an appeal was filed. The court found that the nunc pro tunc mechanism, designed to correct errors and omissions of the court, was inappropriate as used by the lower court to convert recommendations of the commissioner into final judgment. The court's mistaken belief that under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 487.030 the commissioner's findings and recommendations became the judgment of the court, constituted a judicial error, not a clerical error, and therefore could not serve as a basis for an amendment nunc pro tunc. The appeal was again dismissed for lack of finality.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the appeal because the nunc pro tunc amendment creating a retroactive judgment was a violation of the Missouri Rules of Civil Procedure, and the conversion of the commissioner's findings into a final judgment via the nunc pro tunc mechanism was inappropriate, therefore there was no appealable final judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of driving while intoxicated in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 577.010. A patrol officer had discovered defendant's vehicle stopped in a lane of traffic. Defendant was lying down in the car and reeked of alcohol. A blood test revealed a high blood alcohol level. The court affirmed the conviction. The court rejected defendant's argument that a sentence of ninety days confinement was retaliation against defendant for exercising his right to trial by jury. The record did not support defendant's claim that the trial court penalized him for exercising his constitutional rights to trial by jury. The trial court made no mention of defendant's refusal to plea bargain or of his insistence on a jury trial. Instead, the trial court focused on defendant's failure to acknowledge any wrongdoing, to accept responsibility for the violation, or to even admit that he was impaired by alcohol.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for obstruction of government operations, in violation of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 576.030. The court determined that there was sufficient evidence showing that defendant either purposely obstructed, impaired, or hindered the performance of a governmental operation being conducted by law enforcement officials, when he physically placed his tractor and dump truck next to the mobile home, so as to interfere with its removal from the mobile home park in violation of the statute. The court found that a challenged jury instruction properly hypothesized that defendant purposely obstructed the performance of a governmental function, and placed vehicles around a mobile home and refused to move the vehicles from around the mobile home. The court further found that no manifest injustice or miscarriage of justice resulted from the sheriff's testifying about his duties in serving the writ of replevin, and dismissed the contention that the trial court erred in allowing law enforcement officials to intermingle with the jury and to discuss the case within the hearing of the jury because no authority was cited in support of his point.</SPAN></P>

The county charter required that all firefighters take and pass the training offered at the county fire academy.

The plaintiff sued regarding the denial and the respondent city also sued seeking a declaratory judgment arguing that the county charter did not apply to a charter city. The appellate court both agreed and disagreed, holding that the previous conviction, unless expressly related to the ability of the position to fulfill the duties of the position sought, could not be used to deny the plaintiff the right to attend the academy. However, the court also held that the county charter and its progeny did apply to the charter city regarding the training and educating of firefighters because that was a county duty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The defendant driver one was driving a truck for the plaintiff county when he was involved in an accident with the defendant driver two. Driver two's wife was killed in the collision, and driver two and his two minor sons were injured. As a result of the accident, the son filed a lawsuit against both driver one and driver two. Driver two filed a cross-claim against driver one. These cases resulted in judgments against driver one, and the court found that driver one was acting in the course of his employment with the plaintiff. The plaintiff offered to settle all of the claims for $ 400,000, and the plaintiff's position was that $ 400,000 was the maximum it could pay to settle these claims under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.610. The defendants argued that the accident policy adopted by the plaintiff did not limit the amount of damages it would pay on behalf of its employees. The court's determination of whether the plaintiff had authority to adopt an accident policy expanding its liability beyond the limits set by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 537.610.2 was a matter of law. The court held that the plaintiff lacked authority to expand its liability limit beyond the statutory limitations.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff's counsel did not object to this testimony. After plaintiff was convicted, he moved pursuant to Rule 29.15 for an evidentiary hearing on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court denied his motion, and plaintiff appealed. The court affirmed. To establish a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, plaintiff needed to show that his attorney failed to exercise the customary skill and diligence that reasonably competent counsel would provide under similar circumstances and that plaintiff was thereby prejudiced. Subsequent to plaintiff's trial, the law was changed with regard to the admissibility of uncharged crimes involving minor victims. However, trial counsel's performance was evaluated by reference to the law existing at the time of trial. Failure to predict a change in the law was not ineffective assistance.</SPAN></P>

Respondent judge ordered defendant to submit to paternity testing. Relator brought a prohibition action against respondent to bar respondent from enforcing its order. The court vacated the prior order granting the motion for a blood test and barred respondent from compelling defendant to submit to a blood test. The court held that the finding in the marital dissolution decree that the child was born of the marriage was tantamount to a finding that the child was defendant's child. The court found that the definition of child in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 568.040.2(1) (1994) was satisfied irrespective of whether defendant was in fact the child's biological father. Accordingly, the results of a blood test would be immaterial and defendant could not escape criminal liability for nonsupport by proving that he was not the child's biological father. Accordingly, respondent abused his discretion in ordering the test and prohibition was the proper remedy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant county and respondent company were in a zoning dispute pertaining to respondent's farmland. The trial court concluded that proposed feedlot operations by respondent were exempt from zoning regulations under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 64.620. The trial court held that appellant's zoning regulations on feedlots were unconstitutionally vague, ambiguous, and unenforceable. The trial court also held that respondent suffered a temporary taking of property in violation of Mo. Const. art. I, &sect; 26, due to the lawsuit filed by appellant. With respect to the taking claim, the trial court determined only liability, leaving the issue of damages to be resolved at a later date. The trial court certified the judgment as final for purposes of appeal. Appellant challenged the trial court's ruling on the grounds that respondent failed to exhaust administrative remedies and for other reasons. The court dismissed the appeal, however, as the disputed ruling was not final. Although the trial court certified its judgment as final, the claim was not fully resolved due to the outstanding damages issue. The court was therefore without jurisdiction, and it remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court dismissed the appeal because it lacked jurisdiction over the trial court's ruling.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a refueling facility operator, paid the fees imposed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 319.132.1 (1991), for deposit into an underground storage tank insurance fund, although it did not own such tanks. Plaintiff later submitted to the Missouri Department of Revenue (DOR) a refund request for these fees. After a new fund was created, managed by a board of trustees, plaintiff resubmitted its refund request to the board of trustees. The board approved the refund but denied a request for interest thereon. Plaintiff sued defendants, the board of trustees and the DOR, to recover the refund and interest. The circuit court denied plaintiff's summary judgment motion and dismissed its petition, holding the refund claim was moot and the interest claim was barred by sovereign immunity. The court reversed. The fee imposed by Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 319.132.1 was a fee, not a tax. Sovereign immunity applied to tax moneys collected by the state. Further, the moneys in the fund were not state funds. Mo.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was arrested at the site of a suspected methamphetamine laboratory. One of appellant's children was with her at the time of her arrest. A juvenile officer filed a first amended petition alleging that the child was in need of care and treatment. The officer also filed petitions asking the circuit court to exercise jurisdiction over appellant's other children for similar reasons. The petitions also made identical allegations with respect to the children's father. The circuit court found that the children were in need of care and treatment and placed them in the custody of their paternal grandmother. Appellant filed motions as to each petition for rehearing, which were denied. On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal and remanded the case, holding that the denial of appellant's motions for rehearing were not reviewable as judgments because they were not designated as such and thus there was never a final appealable order entered below, depriving the court of appellate jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant department of social services, division of family services, suspended respondent employee without pay for four days for failing to wear a necktie at work. The circuit court reversed the suspension and ordered appellant to pay respondent for his suspension, remove adverse information on the suspension from his personnel file, and reimburse respondent for costs in pursuing the action. Appellant challenged the judgment, claiming the circuit court erred in treating the matter as a contested case. The court agreed. The court reversed and remanded, holding that an administrative agency had the power to establish a dress code for its employees. The issue appeared to be primarily one of policy; there was little dispute about the facts. The court could not determine whether appellant department director had the authority to establish dress code requirements and whether neckties were considered an appropriate mode of dress. The answers to both questions depended on facts not fully developed in the record because of the nature of the hearing in the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction of distribution of a controlled substance near public housing pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;195.218 (1994). Defendant contended &sect;195.218 was applied in a manner which disproportionately impacted a racial minority. The appellate court concluded that defendant could not change his theory on appeal. In defendant's motion to dismiss, defendant requested that the trial court determine the statute was void on its face. The trial court rejected that argument. The appellate court held that defendant's claim that the statute was unconstitutional as applied was not reviewable. Further, it was factually inaccurate to suggest that the trial court erred in a legal ruling that was never requested and not made. Also, the prosecution had no notice of the unconstitutionality issue, and had no opportunity to offer any evidence. Defendant argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel when he was induced to waive his right to a jury trial. The appellate court concluded that defendant was not prejudiced. Defendant testified and admitted he was guilty. The findings, conclusions, and judgment denying relief were not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Prior to defendant's trial for murder, a hearing was held on defendant's motion to suppress inculpatory statements he made to a police officer. The trial court denied the motion, and the statements were admitted at trial. Defendant was convicted of second degree murder. He moved for a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, and the motion was denied. Defendant appealed his conviction and the denial of his motion. The court affirmed. Once defendant alleged that his inculpatory statements were inadmissible, the prosecutor bore the burden of proving the voluntariness of those statements. However, the prosecutor was not required to negate all circumstances which could create an issue of fact concerning the voluntariness of defendant's confession. Absent a showing of special circumstances, the prosecutor only needed to make a prima facie showing of voluntariness, which was shown here. The court also held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting into evidence certain graphic photographs of the victim's wounds because they were not inflammatory or horrifying and assisted the jury in understanding expert testimony.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">An investigator with the Division of Family Services followed up on a hotline call alleging unsanitary conditions, and discovered a victim of sexual abuse. Charges were brought against appellant for felony statutory sodomy after two additional victims were discovered. At trial, two of the victims refused to testify, and the court allowed the testimony of an earlier victim under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 566.025. Appellant was convicted and challenged the conviction asserting prejudicial error in the trial court ruling allowing the earlier victim to testify under the statute. The court noted that the statute allowed evidence of uncharged crimes involving child victims for the purpose of showing the propensity of the defendant to commit the crime with which he was charged. The court held that the statute clearly violated Mo. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 17 and 18. Showing appellant's propensity to commit a given crime was not a proper purpose for admitting evidence because such evidence encouraged the jury to convict appellant because of his propensity to commit such crimes without regard to whether he was actually guilty of the crime charged. Appellant's conviction was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant husband filed an action for a divorce from respondent wife. She filed a petition for declaration of paternity, naming respondent ex-boyfriend as the father of one of her children. The ex-husband appealed from the judgment of the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri, that dismissed the paternity action with prejudice, and entered a judgment of dissolution finding that the husband was the father of the child.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband and the wife were separated in 1978, after the birth of their son. In 1980, during a time when the wife was engaging in sexual relations with her boyfriend, she gave birth to a daughter. The husband claimed he first learned of the child's existence in 1990. In 1988, the state entered an administrative default order obliging the husband to pay support for both the daughter and his son. The husband's claim that he did not receive actual notice of this was unrebutted. In 1995, the husband filed a dissolution petition alleging he was not the father of the daughter. The appellate court agreed with the trial court that the matter was time-barred by former Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.826.1(2) (amended 1993), which obliged the husband to challenge paternity within five years after the child's birth. It rejected the husband's equal protection argument, as he had the opportunity to challenge paternity, but failed to do so in a timely manner. However, collateral estoppel did not apply, because the issue determined in administrative case was whether the husband was the presumed father; the issue in the dissolution case was whether he was the actual father.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A county ordinance terminated the county's contract with the agency and provided that the county itself would directly perform the county's central fire and emergency dispatching function.

The court entered judgment quashing its preliminary order in mandamus and denying a permanent writ. On appeal, the court affirmed. The county clerk refused to judge the sufficiency of these petitions because the county took the position that the ordinance was of the type that became effective immediately upon enactment, and it was therefore was not subject to referendum. The county charter clearly and unequivocally provided that an ordinance was &quot;enacted&quot; when the County Executive approved and signed it. There was no doubt that the ordinance was indeed effective immediately upon &quot;enactment&quot; within the meaning of the charter, and it was therefore not subject to referendum.</SPAN></P>

An officer placed a dollar bill that was folded lengthwise in the zipper of his pants. The dancer extracted the bill with her mouth. The supervisor entered an order finding the club had violated Mo. Code Regs. Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 70-2.130(14) and suspended its license for 10 days. The trial court reversed the AHC's decision, because it found no reference to &quot;oral copulation.&quot; Thus, it found the regulation as it pertained to oral copulation was vague and not enforceable. The appellate court agreed with the trial court since it had not found the term in any dictionary or thesaurus. Nor had it found the phrase listed as a synonym for fellatio or cunnilingus. The phrase &quot;simulated oral copulation&quot; did not delineate its reach in words of common understanding.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;&sect; 452.402.1(1) and 452.402.2 constrained the limits on grandparent visitation.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 452.375.4, frequent and meaningful contact between the father and child, dictated an analysis different from that made by the trial court; 2) at trial, it was undisputed that the only contact between the father and the child came via telephone calls when the child visited with the grandmother; 3) if the record supported a finding that frequent and meaningful contact between the child and the father was in the child's best interests pursuant to Mo. Rev.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the trial court found the father was the natural father of the child who was born to petitioner mother, it awarded child support. On appeal, the father argued: (1) the trial court erred in refusing to allow a jury trial; (2) respondents failed to meet their burden of proof by the preponderance of the evidence that he was the natural father of the child; and (3) the trial court erred in entering the support order. The appellate court advised that although former Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.839.4 (1994) used the word &quot;right,&quot; it did not create a personal or property interest. Accordingly, the appellate court concluded the trial court did not err in rejecting a jury trial on the issue of paternity. Further, the appellate court concluded the test results which supported a conclusion of paternity were admissible without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity. Finally, the appellate court found no manifest abuse of discretion in the award based upon the father's demonstrated earning capacity which was supported by undisputed evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city provided both water and sewer service. Each of the apartment owners' buildings were served by a single &quot;master&quot; water meter. There were no separate water meters measuring water consumed by individual apartment units. The complexes were billed under the &quot;master meter&quot; billing policy. The cost of water and sewer service was passed on to the tenants. The appellate court held the trial court properly equated the &quot;user&quot; charge with a &quot;base&quot; or &quot;fixed&quot; charge. The apartment owners had actual and constructive knowledge of the billing policy for years prior to the institution of the lawsuit and they had accepted the benefits of water and sewer service through master metering. Because they had notice, accepted the benefits of the master meter policy, and demonstrated no prejudice, they were not entitled to relief. There was a rational basis for treating each unit of an apartment complex as any other residential unit. Thus, the city's master meter billing policy did not violate the right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>

The court further held that the city was required to show as a current expenditure only the debt payments due during the fiscal year under its financing agreements to secure the property purchase, rather than the entire amount due under the financing agreements.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held as follows: 1) when viewed in the light most favorable to the State, the evidence demonstrated that defendant swung a wooden paddle like a &quot;ball bat&quot; and struck his stepsons on his buttocks, back, and legs numerous times, causing severe bruising; 2) direct evidence that defendant repeatedly struck the children with a three-foot-long, one-inch-thick board with enough force to cause severe bruises was sufficient substantial evidence for a reasonable juror to conclude that defendant's actions were &quot;cruel and inhuman&quot;; 3) defendant's argument that &sect; 568.606.1(1) required punishment to be retribution was frivolous because those persons who inflicted cruel and inhuman treatment on children for any reason other than retribution, however arbitrary or malicious, would have been acting within the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued, inter alia, that the State failed to make a prima facie forcible rape case because its case was based solely on the victim's uncorroborated testimony and that the trial court erred in ordering that his sentences be served consecutively.

That rule was applicable even if the victim's testimony was inconsistent if the inconsistencies were minor points. The court found that not one of defendant's points about the victim's inconsistent testimony negated the essential elements of the crime. The court also held that the trial court had the discretion to run sentences for multiple convictions of sex crimes concurrently under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 558.026.

The court found that due process was satisfied since the board gave the physician notice of the hearing and allowed him to have counsel present. Additionally, the physician did not preserve his constitutional claim that he was deprived of due process because of the inadequate notice and failure of the board to provide an effective opportunity to defend. The court overruled the physician's contention that the board was enforcing a rule requiring the Federation of State Medical Boards Special Purpose Examination (SPEX) test as proof of competence without formally adopting the rule.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The instant court noted that this case turned on whether the decision in Chastain v. Chastain applied to nullify the division's order. Chastain was decided on October 22, 1996. The order modifying the child support order was dated December 6, 1995, and was filed with the circuit court clerk on January 26, 1996. The instant court determined that there was an administrative attempt to modify a judicial order by a procedure that violated the Missouri Constitution. That made the administrative attempt at modification void. If it was necessary to determine the retroactivity of Chastain, the instant court concluded that it applied to attempts at modification prior to its date. The instant court believed that anyone trained in the law who studied the issue would have had a reasonable suspicion as to the validity of the procedure held unconstitutional in Chastain. Any reliance placed on such a provision should have been with the knowledge that it could be nullified.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers filed an action against the city challenging the constitutionality of the city's &quot;municipal tourism tax.&quot; The Missouri Supreme Court ultimately declared the tax unconstitutional and remanded to the circuit court to declare the tourism tax unconstitutional and for further proceedings consistent with that opinion. The taxpayers alleged on appeal that the trial court should have awarded them attorney's fees. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of attorney's fees, holding that the mandate was not a &quot;general mandate,&quot; but a mandate with specific directions. Thus, the trial court had no authority to award attorney's fees, as that was outside the declaration of the opinion and mandate. The city argued on appeal that the trial court should not have authorized a refund to the taxpayers of taxes paid. The court reversed the refund, holding that, although the taxpayers may have remitted the tax, the taxpayers never alleged, and the record did not indicate, that they paid the tax.</SPAN></P>

It also contended the trial court erred in finding the employee had official immunity against its 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim and its claim for trespass to chattels.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee, purportedly acting in his official capacity without any notice to the insurance company, removed, or caused to be removed, the &quot;HUD Seal&quot; from the insurance company's mobile home. The appellate court held the constitutional claims were mixed with factual issues. Therefore, the fact that the insurance company questioned the statutory scheme's constitutionality did not excuse it from the requirement that it exhaust its administrative remedies. The right to not have personal property unnecessarily or illegally destroyed was a clearly established right of which a reasonable person would have known. In addition, the insurance company pled facts sufficient to indicate the employee was acting under the color of state law at the time he allegedly harmed the property. Therefore, the trial court erred in dismissing the &sect; 1983 claim. Also, it was impossible, from the face of the petition, for the trial court to determine if the alleged damages were justified. Finally, the insurance company stated a cause of action for trespass to chattels, and therefore the trial court erred in dismissing that claim.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city passed an ordinance that established business tax exemptions of two different lengths. The plastic company's application for the longer tax exemption was denied. The electric company paid the city a business license tax on its gross receipts from the plastic company because the tax was assessed against the electric company's gross electrical revenue. The electric company passed the tax onto the plastic company by billing it for the amount but it refused to pay the tax and late fee charges were assessed. The electric company brought an action against the plastic company to recover the value of business license taxes it paid to the city. The trial court ruled in favor of the electric company. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the classification established by the city for tax exemptions was reasonably related to the purpose of its ordinance. The court ruled that the city's time-sensitive economic incentive attempted to stimulate rapid growth by tying economic development to tax relief. The court held that the city had to make reasonable limitations like the one lifetime exemption rule to adequately serve the purposes of its ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State challenged the order entered against it, contending that the administrative order was enforceable, and second, that even if the order was unenforceable, the order was not necessary to support the filing of criminal nonsupport charges against defendant. The court of appeals agreed with the latter argument. The prosecuting attorney's office received a referral from the agency charged with child support enforcement, stating that defendant had paid no child support and requested enforcement. Thereafter, defendant was charged with felony criminal nonsupport. The applicable pattern charge was Mo. Approved Charges Crim. 22.08.2. A comparison of the information with the pattern charge reflected that the information substantially followed that section. The information charged an offense of criminal nonsupport and clearly apprised defendant of the facts surrounding the charge. The listing of the administrative order as one of the bases for prosecution on the information was irrelevant, as it was not a necessary element of the charge.</SPAN></P>

The appeal was dismissed. The employee filed a petition for a writ of mandamus. The personnel advisory board filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee worked for the Missouri Department of Employment Security (the division). He was reprimanded for using profanity in a loud voice to show displeasure when asked to help a customer, and when a telephone call was transferred to him. One of his co-workers told a manager that she thought the employee might bring a gun to the office. The co-worker wrote letters to the manager discussing the employee's behavior. Those letters were placed in the employee's personnel file. Ultimately, the employee was suspended for three days. The employee appealed his suspension to the personnel advisory board, which held it lacked jurisdiction. The employee sought a writ of mandamus. The trial court ordered that the letters be taken out of the employee's file, but denied the petition. The court of appeals held that: (1) the employee was afforded appropriate due process prior to his suspension, since he had notice and opportunity to be heard on the matter; (2) the employee did not have a liberty interest herein, because his good name and reputation were not at stake due to governmental action; and (3) the trial court did not err by not finding Mo.

On review, the appellate court contended his behavior did not satisfy the definition of &quot;stalking,&quot; in that the victim failed to show that: (1) he possessed the requisite intent; (2) that his behavior had no legitimate purpose; and (3) that his behavior would cause a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress. The appellate court agreed that appellant's conduct did not rise to the level of provoking a reasonable person to suffer substantial emotional distress as contemplated by Mo. Rev.

Plaintiff city had filed a complaint against the landowner citing violation of the ordinances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A landowner leased certain lots to a lessee for use of an industrial die-casting business. Then, the lots' zoning changed to central business, and the lessee's use became legally nonconforming. In 1983, the zoning was changed to residential and less-intense commercial uses. The lessee terminated its lease, and the landowner requested a rezoning to operate an automotive sales and repair shop thereon. The city denied the request, and the municipal court found the landowner had violated the city ordinance for operating an auto repair shop in a central business district and Sugar Creek, Mo., Code &sect; 17-41 for operating a trade without a license. On appeal from the circuit court's affirmance of the judgment, the court held that: (1) the landowner was bound by the 1983 zoning ordinance prohibiting changes between nonconforming uses even though it was enacted after he acquired ownership of property, and he lacked a vested, constitutional right to change the use of the property from a die-cast to an automotive sales and repair shop; and (2) there was no unconstitutional taking because no existing property right was affected by the city's enforcement of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant property owners appealed an adverse decision by the Circuit Court of Pike County (Missouri) in plaintiff city's action for an injunction and a declaratory judgment to determine upon which, if any, of the owners' six adjacent lots they could lawfully place mobile homes. The owners contended that Louisiana, Mo., Ordinance No. 6478 (1994), upon which the judgment was based, was unenforceable because its enactment was invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city brought an action against the property owners to enjoin them from placing mobile homes on each of their adjacent six lots and for a determination on which lots they could site mobile homes. The court reversed the circuit court's judgment for the city, entered a judgment for the owners, and found that ordinance 6478, on which the circuit court based its decision, was invalid because it was enacted without compliance with the notice and hearing requirements of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.060 (1994). The city's general zoning ordinance, Louisiana, Mo., Ordinance No. 6266, contained no definition of the term &quot;mobile home park&quot; and the provisions of ordinance 6266 that prohibited any &quot;mobile home park&quot; within an R-2 zoned district would have been difficult to enforce absent a working definition of that term. Consequently, the court ruled that Louisiana, Mo., Ordinance No. 6478 (1994), if held to be valid, effectively would have resulted in a substantive change to the city's zoning regulations affecting R-2 Mobile Home Dwelling Districts. As such, ordinance 6478 was required to comply with Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 89.060 (1994) and its non-compliance rendered it void and unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the circuit court's judgment that the property owners were allowed to place a mobile home on only one of their six adjacent lots in the city's action for an injunction and for a declaratory judgment to determine the allowable placement. The court also entered a judgment for the owners and ordered the city to issue, upon proper application, the necessary building permits to allow them to place mobile homes on their lots.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Missouri Public Defender's Office fired an assistant public defender before one of her murder cases went to trial. The trial court denied a continuance and ordered that the fired attorney represent the indigent defendant. The attorney's subsequent request for a writ of prohibition was denied, and the trial court denied her motion to withdraw. The Public Defender's Office indicated that it was unwilling to retain the attorney as private counsel. After the proceeding ended in a mistrial, the trial court ordered the Public Defender's Office to pay the attorney. In an original proceeding, the court made its order of prohibition absolute. The court ruled that the trial court lacked authority to compel the Public Defender's Office to use public funds to pay attorney fees to private counsel with whom it did not contract under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 600.042(10) (1994). The court held that the Public Defender's Office could not be estopped from disclaiming financial responsibility because it made clear its intention not to retain the attorney. Further, the court stated that uncompensated, compelled appointments of counsel did not violate the Missouri or United States Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In two separate cases involving claims for injuries, an insurer paid money as part of a settlement of the claims, and the department of medical services claimed a lien under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 208.215 (1994). In each case, pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 208.125 (1996), the trial court reduced the amount of the department's lien. Each lawsuit had been filed before the effective date of the new statute. The court affirmed, determining that the legislature intended for the trial court to apply the version of the statute in existence at the time the judgment was entered. The statutory revision was remedial in nature, not substantive, because it substituted a more appropriate remedy for the enforcement of the department's existing right in its cause of action to recover public assistance benefits paid. Because the statute was remedial, it operated retrospectively where the legislature did not expressly state otherwise. Moreover, the legislature had the right to waive the substantive rights of the department, which was a state agency. The trial court discharged its statutory duty to consider evidence pertaining to the six factors in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 208.215.9 when reducing the lien.</SPAN></P>

The court granted a preliminary order in prohibition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The wife filed for divorce and for damages from a sexually transmitted disease that her husband infected her with. Respondent was an associate circuit judge and had jurisdiction to hear and determine all cases within the trial court, including tort and domestic relations cases. The assignment of both counts of this case to respondent was proper. The court reasoned that the Missouri Supreme Court had just abolished interspousal immunity for tort claims and the wife was entitled to maintain the tort action against her husband. The court rejected the husband's argument that the wife should be required to make an election to avoid issue preclusion or a double recovery. The court reasoned that there was a difference between a division of marital property and an award of damages and permitted both actions. Also, it was unaware of the extent of the parties' marital property. If the amount was limited and if the wife prevailed on her misconduct allegation, she might not be made whole if the dissolution counts was tried first. The court found that judicial economy and the parties would best be served if one judge heard both counts. The court dissolved the preliminary order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The remaining directors had contended that the dispute was an ecclesiastical matter. The trial court had concluded that the Quorum of Apostles was the legally constituted authority of the church and not the administrative committee as contended by the removed directors. The court affirmed the decision, finding that the officers of a religious society were to be determined according to the discipline of that society and civil courts would not review the decision of a competent ecclesiastical body upon a question involving the election of officers. Thus, the trial court correctly applied the law in that the act of ousting the leaders of a religious body was an ecclesiastical matter. The question of who was authorized to act in the priesthood position of apostle was not within the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction as such determination concerned doctrine, creed or form of worship of the church. The determination of who were qualified members of the church was an ecclesiastical matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff tobacco vendors and defendants, a county and the county executive, all sought review of the judgment of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County (Missouri), which denied the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment and upheld an ordinance regulating the sale of tobacco, but struck down its requirement that tobacco vendors secure a license and pay a license fee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county passed an amendment to it public health regulations providing that all vendors of tobacco had to be licensed by the county department of health, and that the vendors were required to secure licenses by paying a license fee. The trial court upheld regulation of tobacco sales as a valid health measure but struck down the licensing requirement and license fee provision. The court held that the ordinance was a valid health measure because the evidence was ample that it bore a reasonable relation to its goal of reducing the use of tobacco, particularly by minors. The court then held that the licensing provision violated the Hancock Amendment, Mo. Const. art. X, &sect; 22(a), which required such a license fee to be approved by a majority of qualified voters, noting that the fees were paid on a periodic basis by all tobacco retailers, the amount of the fee was not dependent on the delivery of a service by the county, and the prosecution of violations was a governmental function. The court then held that the licensing provision was severable under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 1.140 (1994) because the ordinance could still accomplish its purpose without it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court to the extent that it held that any part of the ordinance in question was unconstitutional except for the provisions calling for licensing fees and reversed and remanded the judgment to the extent that it refused to award costs, directing that the vendors were entitled to recover fees and costs for the successful litigation of a Hancock Amendment action.</SPAN></P>

The trial court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 536.110 and due to the owner's failure to state a justiciable cause of action. Affirming, the court held that the date of the hearing was the date of the final order because the owner was given a copy of the findings and orders on that date. As the owner had 30 days to comply with or appeal, she failed to timely appeal and deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to review the city's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor was a four-year-old child who was struck by a motorist while crossing a street and suffered permanent injuries. The minor was a Medicaid recipient. The minor's mother settled her claim against the motorist for $ 25,000. The department perfected a lien for $ 91,841, which represented the benefits used to compensate medical providers for the treatment of the minor and sought to enforce the lien against the $ 25,000 proceeds from the settlement of the claim. The trial court reduced the lien to $ 8,333, which was the equivalent of 50 percent of the remaining recovery amount from the settlement of the claim against the motorist. On appeal, the court held that the legislature had not indicated by express language that &sect; 208.215 was to operate retroactively. Similarly, a thorough reading of the statute did not reveal an unavoidable implication that &sect; 208.215 should be applied retroactively. The court found the evidence presented to the trial court through stipulation and the testimony of the mother sufficient to support the trial court's exercise of discretion in favor of lien reduction. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Following the classification of the taxpayer's apartment complex as commercial property by respondent assessor, the taxpayer appealed the valuation to respondent commission. The commission affirmed the classification. The circuit court upheld the decision of the commission and the taxpayer sought review arguing that the property was residential under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.016.1(1) (1994) because it was improved by structures of not more than four dwelling units. The taxpayer also contended that the classification was arbitrary and violated its right to due process under both the United States and Missouri constitutions. The court held that the connecting wall separating the apartments in each six or seven unit building contained doorways accessing each of the units on both sides of the wall. Thus, the court concluded that the central firewall in each building was not a wall with no structure-to-structure openings and did not meet the first prong of the Morton test for a structural wall which created separate structures under &sect; 137.016.1(1). Additionally, the court held that the taxpayer's constitutional claims had been waived.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A developer exercised an option to lease property for the purpose of developing and operating a gaming and hotel facility, after defendant county issued a rezoning order. Plaintiff landowner owned real estate abutting the subject property, and opposed the development because she felt it would have a bad effect on the restored town. The landowner did not present evidence of any actual damages that would be suffered, and the trial court declared the rezoning order to be valid, enforceable, and reasonable. Viewing the approval of a Planned Unit Development zoning classification as a legislative act encompassing the approval of the development plan, the court reviewed the judgment of the trial court de novo, but deference was accorded to the trial court's ability to assess credibility. Therefore, two of the landowner's counts were properly dismissed as they failed to state a claim for relief as a matter of law. The trial court's decision to strike the count requesting injunctive relief did not materially affect the merits of the action, since it specifically found that the rezoning order did not constitute a &quot;subdivision of land,&quot; and the landowner failed to contest that finding.</SPAN></P>

The hospital paid its portion, and the second physician entered into a post-judgment settlement with the individual. The physician paid his portion and argued that the second physician's settlement operated to reduce the judgment by his equitable 45 percent share. Thus, the balance of the judgment was satisfied by the payments of the physician and the hospital. The individual stated she was entitled to the balance of the judgment pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect;537.060. Upon review, the court found that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 538.230 applied to post-judgment settlements. If there had been no settlement, the physician would have had the right to pursue the remaining parties for contribution for whatever he was held to pay.

The court held that statistical evidence of the actual risk of infection was unnecessary. The court also affirmed the refusal to allow defendant to present evidence that the victim tested HIV negative because it was not relevant to his defense, and the issue was not properly preserved for appeal. The court further held that defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by his exclusion from the courtroom when the jury returned its verdict because of his continued contumacious behavior.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant State appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Jackson County (Missouri) that dismissed its petition against respondent father to declare paternity and procure child support in support of appellant minor child. The trial court dismissed with prejudice the State's amended petition on the ground that the action was time-barred under the state law, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.826.1(2), and state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The minor was born in 1984. At the time, his mother was married to the father, who was serving an 18-year prison term. The State's petition alleged that either the father or another man was the natural father of the minor. A blood test showed that the second man had a 99.99% probability of paternity. The trial court found that the second man was the presumed father and that the State had filed its action more than five years after the minor was born. The trial court applied the five-year statute of limitations in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.826.1(2) (Supp. 1988) and dismissed the claim with prejudice. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court reasoned that the Uniform Parentage Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.817 et seq., established a rebuttable presumption of paternity when a man was married to the child's nature mother. The right to file an action to establish the nonexistence of a presumed parental relationship existed only if the action was filed within five years after the child's birth under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.826.1(2). The act was amended but the original five-year statute of limitations still applied.</SPAN></P>

MSD filed a motion to dismiss. The trial court sustained MSD's motion, finding Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 139.031, which governed tax refunds, was the exclusive means by which the customers could recover any refund, and because the customers failed to follow that procedure, their claim was barred. The customers appealed the trial court's judgment and filed a motion to transfer, asserting that only the Missouri Supreme Court had jurisdiction of the matter because &sect; 139.031 was a revenue law of the state. Upon review, the court decided that &sect; 139.031 was not a revenue law of the state, and therefore, the court had jurisdiction over the matter. The court ultimately decided that the customers were required to satisfy the payment under protest provisions of &sect; 139.031 in order to recover any refund, and their failure to do so barred their claim, however, the court transferred the matter to the Missouri Supreme Court because the issues raised by the case were of sufficient general interest and importance to warrant such transfer.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed the action because it was time-barred. The court held that pursuant to the terms of Mo. Rev.

Although &sect; 516.105 was unconstitutional to the extent that it prevented a minor patient's right of access to the courts for redress, the unconstitutional portion of &sect; 516.105 was severable from the constitutional part.

The trial court affirmed the board's decision and the court reversed and remanded. The court stated that it was required to review questions of law only, not to conduct a de novo review. The court noted that Kansas City, Mo., Code of Ordinances &sect; 2-1267(a)(1) (1994) provided that a duty disability pension could only be awarded to a person who became permanently and totally disabled directly due to and caused by actual performance of duty as a firefighter. The court disagreed with the board and the trial court and held that it was not required that the work injury be the sole cause of the disability.

Intervenor next lowest bidder (nlb) sued the city in federal court. The low bidder intervened. The nlb appealed to defendant fairness board. The court claim was dismissed.

An authorizing ordinance was passed. The nlb contested the procedure by which the departments apparently had helped the low bidder win bid approval. The federal court found that it had no subject matter jurisdiction because the nlb could show neither a bidding violation nor a property interest. The basis of the writ was that the federal court dismissal, by res judicata, barred the nlb from proceeding before the board. The appellate court found no res judicata in that the issues presented and relief sought in federal court were not the same as those before the board. Although the board had subject matter jurisdiction, the authority granted the board under either a mayoral letter agreement or Kansas City, Mo., Code of Ordinances &sect; 38-100, did not include overruling human relations department decisions that had been subsequently ratified by city council action. The extent to which the human relations department had followed the bidding procedure authority had not been an issue in federal court, but had been the issue before the board.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.826.1(2) (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother became re-acquainted with the putative father, her high school sweetheart, after she separated from her husband. She gave birth on April 13, 1981. The child's birth certificate identified her husband as the father. The Division and mother commenced an action to establish the putative father's paternity in 1994. The trial court sustained his motion to dismiss the action. The Division and mother appealed from that decision. Under the Uniform Parentage Act, the mother's husband was presumed to be the child's father by reason of their marriage. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.826.1(2) (1987) specified that an action to rebut that presumption had to be brought within five years of the child's birth. However, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.826.1 (1994) provided that such actions could be brought at any time. The court held that the amended statute could not to be applied retrospectively because the mother's husband acquired a vested right to be free from a challenge to his paternity. The putative father had acquired a similar right not to be subject to a paternity action. Therefore, the trial court properly dismissed the matter as time-barred under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 210.826.1(2) (1987).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The circuit court previously ordered a partial refund of real estate taxes paid by the owner due to the alleged miscalculation of an apartment complex as commercial property.

The court reversed and remanded, with directions to dismiss the county assessor's petition, holding that although the owner's brief repeatedly attempted to characterize the circuit court's judgment as a straightforward application of the residential assessment ratio to the property value stipulated by the parties before the State Tax Commission, the fact is that in ordering a refund based on the alleged misclassification, the circuit court implicitly made a determination of value for which it had no authority to make.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his convictions in the Circuit Court of Cole County (Missouri) for assault in the first degree, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 565.050 (1994), and armed criminal action, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.015 (1994). He was sentenced as a persistent offender to 10 years on each count, running consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed the trial court plainly erred in sentencing him to consecutive terms of imprisonment, pursuant to his convictions for assault in the first degree and armed criminal action, because the trial court misinterpreted the armed criminal action statute in its belief that the statute required consecutive sentences. The appellate court agreed, finding that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 571.015.1 (1994) did not mandate that a sentence imposed under the armed criminal action statute be imposed consecutively to the sentence for the underlying felony. Second, defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion by denying defense counsel's motion that his wrist restraints be removed at trial. As he was charged with a serious crime involving a violent assault upon his girlfriend and did not demonstrate any prejudice, the claim was denied. Finally, defendant noted the trial court's judgment was incorrect with respect to count I. The court's judgment incorrectly stated that defendant was found guilty of and sentence was entered on the Class A felony, assault in the first degree with serious injury. However, the entry could be corrected by the entry of an order nunc pro tunc.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city challenged a decision from the St. Louis City Circuit Court (Missouri), which enjoined the city and its agents from entering respondent property owner's private property pursuant, St. Louis, Mo., Rev. Code ch. 17.56 (1994) (ordinance), to remove a disabled car unless the property owner's consent or a warrant was first obtained, and which declared part of the ordinance unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The property owner kept a car in his backyard on a paved surface, which the city ordered removed, pursuant to the ordinance, because the car was not operable or was a public safety hazard. On appeal, an administrative board found that the ordinance was violated and ordered the car removed by the property owner or the city. The property owner sought an injunction and administrative review. The trial court reversed, enjoined the city from removing the car without either the property owner's consent or a warrant, and held that St. Louis, Mo., Rev. Code &sect; 17.56.20.B.9 (1994) was unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that the ordinance was not arbitrary and was a proper use of the city's police powers. The court held that the property owner failed to plead the issues of due process and taking without just compensation; thus, the trial court improperly found the ordinance unconstitutional on those grounds. The city was obligated to comply with the Fourth Amendment by either obtaining the property owner's consent or obtaining a warrant before the city removed the car from the property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's finding that the ordinance was arbitrary, that it bore no relationship to the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare, and that it was unconstitutional. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that enjoined the city from entering private property pursuant to the ordinance to remove the inoperable car without first obtaining consent or a warrant.</SPAN></P>

The Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis, Missouri, upheld the validity of the ordinance imposing a license fee of 11 percent of the cost of natural gas purchased from suppliers outside the city but used within the city. Plaintiffs appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs contended on appeal that the circuit court erred in upholding the validity of the ordinance, asserting that the city lacked statutory authority to adopt the license fee, and that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 92.045 (1994) supported their position. That statute granted the city authority to impose a license fee based in some way upon what the licensee sold in the way of goods or provided in the way of services as part of its business activities, but not upon what the licensee spent or purchased in furtherance of its business activities. The court found that the license fee imposed on plaintiffs by the city was measured by the amount of natural gas they purchased and that the license fee was therefore not authorized by &sect; 92.045. The city posited that in the absence of statutory authority, it had authority under Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19(a), to impose the license fee. The court held that the license fee imposed was in the nature of a use tax, that for the time periods at issue the state completely occupied and preempted the field of use taxes in Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 144 (1994), and that the city therefore lacked authority to enact a use tax under Mo. Const. art. VI, &sect; 19(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees, Dunklin County, Missouri, Assessor and County Commissioners, filed an action against appellant State Tax Commission of Missouri, with the Dunklin County Circuit Court (Missouri) to rule on the differences submitted in a two-year tax assessment maintenance plan for taxable years 1997-1998. The circuit court determined that the construction cost index was 1.56, and the tax commission appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">According to the county, a local construction cost index was a number by which an appraisal system manual cost must be multiplied to yield an actual cost of construction in the locality. The tax commission asserted that the result of an insufficient construction cost index was that new property was assessed and subsequently taxed at a level less than older construction in the county. The county sought approval for a construction cost index of 1.54, whereas the tax commission maintained that the construction cost index should have been 1.70. The appellate court ruled determined sua sponte that it had no jurisdiction to review the purported judgment of the circuit court. In view of the fact that Mo. Rev. Stat. ch. 621 (1994) was chiefly concerned with the establishment of and grant of powers given to the Administrative Hearing Commission (AHC), it was logical to presume that, at least facially, the plain and ordinary meaning of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 137.115.1 (1994) appeared to require the AHC to review the judgment of the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

The employee was previously warned that further acts of this nature would result in termination. The appellate court found that: (1) the employee was entitled to judicial review of the commissioner's decision, as both merit employees and non-merit employees of agencies adopting the provisions of Mo. Rev.

Rev. Stat. ch. 536; and (3) given the facts of this case, the commissioner was well within his discretion to determine that the employee's treatment of a subordinate employee was in violation of personnel policy 8-2G1.C.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After Mo. Rev.

The court held that the trial court properly dismissed the taxpayer's action because Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.190 did not permit a class action to serve as the means of refunding the taxes at issue. The state could not be sued without its consent. Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 144.190 constituted a limited waiver of the state's sovereign immunity to permit recovery of taxes illegally collected.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county obtained voter approval to levy a tax on the charges for all sleeping rooms that were paid by the transient guests of the hotels or the motels that were situated in the county. The tax proceeds were to be used by the authority to fund the construction of convention center, visitor, and sports facilities. The owners operated a bed and breakfast where a majority of the guest stayed less than three nights. The owners' living quarters were separate from the guest sleeping rooms. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment which found that the owners were liable for the county's tax that was imposed pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 67.1158.1, 67.1158.2. The owners' bed and breakfast fell within the definitions of &quot;hotel&quot; or &quot;motel&quot; that were used in Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 67.1158.1 because the court applied the terms in their ordinary and usual sense by the dictionary definitions. The dictionary did not limit a &quot;hotel&quot; or a &quot;motel&quot; by the number of rooms. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion when it decided to deny the authority's request for a penalty due to the owners' failure to pay the tax.</SPAN></P>

The murdered wife's heirs contended that the trial court should have treated the murdered wife as the survivor so that she could take under his will as if she had survived him. The murdered wife's heirs argued that the murderer-husband and those claiming under him had been permitted to enrich themselves by reason of the murder and that the murderer-husband's heirs had obtained legal title to the murderer-husband's entire estate through the unlawful acts of the murderer-husband. The murdered wife's heirs claimed that their petition stated a cause of action based on the principle that when one spouse murders the other spouse, the murderer is not a survivor in contemplation of law. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that the murderer-husband did not forfeit his property by his act of murder. The murderer-husband and his heirs were not receiving any benefit from the murdered wife's assets. Instead, the murderer-husband's heirs were receiving an estate that was vested before the murder occurred, and their relationship to the murderer-husband could not forfeit an otherwise vested estate.</SPAN></P>

The lessee was a tenant of a research park and operated a for-profit golf course on the land leased from the research park and owned by a state university. The court held that because the board had to presume the tax exemption statute to have been constitutional and determine the exemption issues accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion or exceed its jurisdiction in ordering the board to do so. Further, the court reasoned that because the board exceeded its jurisdiction by considering the constitutionality of the statute, the existence of any other adequate remedies, administrative or judicial, did not preclude mandamus.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of his convictions from the Circuit Court of Buchanan County (Missouri) for murder in the second degree and armed criminal action, on the grounds that the lower court erred by precluding the submission of evidence that appellant could not discern the consequences of his conduct because of his state of intoxication and his mental deficiencies at the time that the victim was stabbed to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of murder in the second degree and armed criminal action and challenged his convictions claiming that the lower court erred in precluding the testimony of his proffered expert that appellant's level of intoxication, in combination with appellant's claimed brain damage, impaired appellant's ability to appreciate the nature, quality, and wrongfulness of his conduct. The court affirmed appellant's convictions. The court found that the lower court's exclusion under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 562.076 did not offend appellant's constitutional right to due process because the legislature was deemed to have disallowed the consideration of voluntary intoxication when state of mind was at issue so as to avoid imputing a required mens rea from a state of voluntary intoxication and requiring the prosecution to satisfy its burden of proof as to all necessary elements of the crime charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's convictions for murder in the second degree and armed criminal action were affirmed on the grounds that relevant statutory law permitted the lower court to disallow the consideration of voluntary intoxication as to appellant's state of mind in an effort to avoid imputing a required mens rea from appellant's intoxication.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Livingston County Circuit Court, Missouri, which convicted him of murder, assault in the first degree, burglary, and two counts of armed criminal action. He was sentenced, respectively, to consecutive terms of 10, 5, 10, 3, and 3 years imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the prosecution failed to make a submissible case because it could show only that his fingerprint was on a box of shells that may have been used in the crime. Defendant contended the prosecution could not show that the fingerprint was not placed on the shell box at a time other than the time of the murder. The court found that the question of when the print was placed on the box of ammunition was a jury question, and that the fingerprint evidence, when combined with the other evidence in the case, made a weak but submissible case against defendant. The court remand the case for a new trial because of error by the trial court in excluding evidence that another person had motive and opportunity to commit the crime. The court found this evidence was admissible because one of the victims stated prior to trial that the other person was the one who had shot him. The court held that, although the victim denied making the earlier identification, his prior inconsistent statements were admissible as substantive evidence on this point and provided an adequate foundation for admission of the other evidence allegedly inculpating the other individual.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. The court found error in failing to admit evidence of prior inconsistent statements of a victim as substantive evidence and the consequent erroneous exclusion of evidence that another person had motive and opportunity to commit the crimes. The court rejected the other claims of error made by defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim was injured and the child was killed in a boating accident on a lake. Appellants argued that a portion of the lake was hazardous because rocks were located close to the surface and there was no warning of their presence. On appeal the court found that because the undisputed facts concerning the county's lease showed that the alleged dangerous condition of property was not a part of the leased premises under the county's control, and because there was no other potential theory of liability against the county in view of the doctrine of sovereign immunity, summary judgment was properly granted. The county leased a portion of the shoreline around the lake, which the United States owned. The county's control stopped at the water-line of the lake, and the only area that the county administered were two designated swimming areas and the areas around the boat docks and ramps. The accident did not occur on any property controlled by the county. The county director of parks' deposition, maps, and the lease complied with the requirements of Mo. R. Civ. P. 74.04(e), and appellants failed to present any evidence to refute the county's evidence.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff grandmother appealed from the portion of the judgment that denied a change of custody from the father to her.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grandmother was granted extensive visitation. When the father married a woman who lived in another state, he sought permission to change the residence of the child to Colorado to enable the father and the child to live with the father's new wife. The court reversed the trial court's order denying the father permission to relocate. The grandmother was only entitled to visitation rights that were in the best interest of the child and that were minimally intrusive on the family relationship. The visitation order erroneously granted her visitation rights on a par with a parent, and the denial of the father's right to cohabit with his wife on the basis of the grandmother's visitation rights was clearly a violation of his basic civil rights. The interests of the father should not have been subordinated to the interests of the grandmother in visiting the child. The court also reversed the award of attorney's fees in the nature of support because the father did not have an obligation to support the grandmother. The court affirmed the denial of the grandmother's motion for a change of custody, finding that there was no change of circumstances sufficient to authority a change of custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimants and the decedent were involved in an automobile accident, which killed the decedent. The decedent' wife presented his will for probate. A small estate affidavit was filed under Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.097 (1994) and a notice to creditors was published for four consecutive weeks. The clerk of court then entered a certificate stating that the wife was entitled to the property set out in decedent's will. Some eight months later, the claimants sought to reopen the estate, claiming that they never received notice. Their principal claim was that the notice by publication provisions of Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 473.097.5 (1994) violated the claimants' due process rights. Because the court concluded that this claim involved a substantial question as to the validity of 473.097.5, the court transferred the case to the state supreme court. Under Mo. Const. art. V, &sect; 3, the state supreme court had exclusive appellate jurisdiction in all cases involving the validity of a state statute. After determining that the state supreme court had never ruled on this question, the court concluded that it was without appellate jurisdiction and that a transfer was required.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The billboard company brought suit for declaratory judgment against the City and sought a declaration that the City's Ordinance, Bridgeton, Mo., Municipal Code &sect; 610.090, was unconstitutional. The ordinance in question established a yearly tax on every billboard located within the City's limits. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The trial court granted the billboard company's motion and declared that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The City appealed. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the ordinance did not prohibit that which Missouri Billboards Act, Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 226.500-.600 (Cum. Supp. 1993) permitted, nor did it permit that which the Act prohibited. The court found that the ordinance did not conflict with the purposes of the Act in validating and affirming the use of outdoor advertising signs on interstate and primary highway systems. The court further held that the tax imposed by the ordinance did not implicate the First Amendment and was not unreasonable as applied to the billboard company because the billboard company's evidence showed that it was earning annual net revenues far in excess of the tax.</SPAN></P>

On appeal the court held that the Supreme Court of Missouri had exclusive jurisdiction of the issues raised in the case because determining whether the use of &quot;invoice&quot; in a car dealer's advertisements was more likely to deceive the public rather than inform it presented a real and substantial constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was arrested for furnishing intoxicants to a minor. As defendant was arrested, he reached for his right front pocket. He removed a white object that he managed to throw away. One of the officers retrieved the object. It was cocaine. Defendant testified at trial that he previously worked for the DEA, FBI, and the Northeast Arkansas Drug Task Force. At trial, he was asked what he intended to do with the cocaine. The prosecution objected to the question as being self-serving and speculative. The trial court sustained the objection. Defendant was convicted. The court affirmed. The excluded testimony did not go to an element of his offense and would have provided no defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his direct appeal defendant contended that the trial court erred by not dismissing and in instructing on counts III and IV for armed criminal action and assault because the information was fatally defective in that it did not charge the offense for which defendant was convicted. Defendant contended the information did not by any reasonable construction charge the offense of first degree assault because it alleged only that defendant recklessly caused injury, whereas the statute required a state of mind of knowingly causing injury for first degree assault. The court found that because the necessary culpable mental state was misstated in the information for both the assault and armed criminal action count, the decision had to reversed. Defendant also argued the trial court erred in denying defendant's post-conviction motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. The court stated that because the motion was not filed timely, the dismissal was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The user raised three issues: (1) that the Sewer District lacked statutory authority to charge it higher rates for sewage treatment, (2) that the statute purporting to grant the Sewer District the power to charge higher rates violated due process in that it was unconstitutionally vague, and (3) that the trial court improperly failed to exercise jurisdiction to review the rates under equitable principles. The Sewer District conceded that Mo. Rev. Stat. &sect; 249.785 controlled rate setting with regard to users within the district. On appeal, the court determined that the trial court appropriately granted summary judgment to the Sewer District because &sect; 249.777 was controlling where the Sewer District was setting rates by contract with entities located outside the district's boundaries, such as the user. The court found that the constitutional claim by the user was merely colorable, and not real and substantial. The court held that the rate charged to the user was strictly a matter of contract, and, as such, was not subject to review on the basis of equitable principles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, allegedly a recovering chemical dependent, appealed from his conviction of illegal delivery of a controlled substance, cocaine base. On appeal, the court held that there was no error in the trial court's refusal to give an entrapment instruction where an undercover officer's inquiry to defendant about where to obtain drugs did not demonstrate that the officer solicited, encouraged, or otherwise induced defendant to engage in illegal conduct when he was not ready and willing to engage in such conduct. The court reversed the motion court's imposition of sanctions against counsel for raising issues on appeal, which had been decided previously by case law and determined to be without merit, and found that the motion court abused its discretion in applying Rule 55.03 sanctions. Defendant had standing in his appeal to raise the validity of the sanctions imposed on his attorney. Although the court found Rule 55.03 to be applicable to post-conviction motions, the imposition of sanctions based on the raising of legal positions, which counsel believed necessary to raise to avoid waiving them for subsequent state appellate review or federal habeas corpus relief, was not warranted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The husband served a subpoena duces tecum on the wife requesting that she bring a litany of documents to the next days court proceeding. The trial court, upon the wife's motion, quashed the husband's subpoena. On appeal, the husband argued that the trial court's actions constituted an unconstitutional state action in that it denied him his right to subpoena witnesses and to obtain relevant evidence. The court held that the subpoena demanded production of a great volume of documents and was not served until the afternoon before the morning hearing and therefore the trial court properly determined that the subpoena was oppressive. Next, the husband argued that the trial court erred in its calculation of presumed child support in that it failed to consider the tax exemptions for the children and failed to consider the parties' income from the rental property. The court held that allocation of a tax exemption was a separate and distinct issue from child support in dissolution proceedings and evaluated like any other asset or property rather than as part of a support order.
