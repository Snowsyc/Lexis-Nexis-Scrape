<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(b). Appellant demurred to the complaint on the grounds that the facts alleged failed to state a public offense. At the hearing on the demurrer, it was agreed between appellant and the district attorney that appellant was not a prostitute and had not engaged in an act of prostitution. The municipal court overruled the demurrer. Appellant filed a petition for writ of prohibition in the Fresno County Superior Court asking it to restrain the municipal court from taking any further action in the case other than to order a dismissal. The superior court denied the writ. Appellant sought review. The words in &sect; 647 stated that &quot;every person&quot; who committed certain actions were guilty of disorderly conduct. Despite these words, appellant contended that the legislative history and prior judicial interpretation applied the statute to prostitutes and not customers. The reviewing court concluded that the legislative history was not helpful in deciding the matter. The court affirmed the judgment denying the writ. Under the ordinary meaning of the statute, a customer could be charged with the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which found in favor of respondent housing complex owner that in-lieu fees levied under Fremont, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 8-1716 were unlawfully applied by appellant to respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent housing complex owner filed an application with appellant city for approval of a subdivision map to convert its apartments into condominiums. While it was pending, appellant enacted Fremont, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 8-1716, an ordinance authorized under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 11546. Appellant eventually approved the plan, subject to the condition that respondent pay in-lieu fees as required by &sect; 8-1716. The trial court found that &sect; 8-1716 had been unlawfully applied. On appeal, the court reversed and ordered the trial court to enter judgment for appellant. When &sect; 8-1716 was enacted, &sect; 11546 provided that subdivisions were subject to the fees, subdivisions included condominiums, and appellant was presumed to have understood this in enacting the ordinance. Section 11546 was a revenue statute designed for the acquisition of municipal parklands; thus &sect; 8-1716 could not be considered a local zoning ordinance subject to the provisions of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 1370. There was no constitutional requirement of uniform treatment and the legislative classification was not erroneous or arbitrary. The proper amount of levied fees was the amount equal to the value of the unimproved land.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and ordered the trial court to enter judgment in favor of appellant city because the in-lieu fees applied to respondent housing complex owner were valid. The conversion of respondent's apartments to condominiums was considered to be a subdivision, subject to the fees. The legislative classification was not arbitrary and the proper amount of the fees should be the unimproved land's value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction by the Superior Court, Santa Clara County (California), under which defendant was committed to the state youth authority following his plea of guilty to second degree murder in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, seven weeks under the age of 18 at the time of the offense, was charged with the strangulation death of his mother. The juvenile court found defendant not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law and directed the district attorney to prosecute defendant under the applicable criminal statute, as provided in Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 707. The juvenile court denied defendant's petition for a rehearing on that decision. The trial court denied defendant's petition for remand to the juvenile court. Defendant pleaded guilty to second degree murder, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187, 189. The trial court entered a judgment of conviction, committing defendant to the state youth authority. The appellate court held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to remand the proceedings to the juvenile court. The court concluded that the record did not support defendant's contentions that the juvenile court relied on inadequate evidence and inappropriate factors in concluding that defendant was not a fit and proper subject to be dealt with under the juvenile court law or that defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of conviction from the Justice Court for the Needles-Calzona Judicial District of San Bernardino County (California), for driving a vehicle with illegally tinted front side windows in violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 26101.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was cited for driving a vehicle with illegally tinted front side windows in violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 26101. He moved to dismiss the charge on various constitutional grounds, the primary one being that the statute placed an undue burden on interstate commerce. The trial court denied the motion to dismiss and found appellant guilty of the charge. On review, appellant renewed his constitutional challenge to the statute. In order in order to evaluate a state statute facing a commerce clause challenge, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 8, cl. 3, the court found that it was required to give sensitive consideration to the weight and nature of the state regulatory concern weighed against the burden imposed on the course of interstate commerce. Here, the court concluded that the statute promoted legitimate safety concerns, which clearly outweighed its problematical effect on interstate commerce. Therefore, the court held that &sect; 26101, as applied in this case, was a constitutional regulatory measure that did not unreasonably burden interstate commerce. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction was affirmed because trial court correctly determined that the statute was a constitutional regulatory measure, which did not unreasonably burden interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

On appeal defendant argued that &sect; 11364 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court noted first that constitutional overbreadth was a first amendment doctrine and therefore untenable. The court then maintained that &sect; 11364 prohibited possession of a pipe for smoking cocaine and that the court had no difficulty finding evident the statutory purpose of eliminating the sale and use of drugs. The court also held that the purpose of the pipe was a question of fact and could be determined from officer's opinion even though the fact embraced the ultimate issue to be decided.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 27315, failure to wear a seatbelt. The court stated that because appellant asserted his conviction was not supported by substantial evidence, the court must determine whether there was any substantial evidence that supported the trial court's findings. The evidence in the record showed that the officer who issued the citation testified that he only cited a person for not wearing a seat belt if he actually observed the conduct and that appellant in his own testimony vowed that he would never wear a seat belt. Therefore, the court found substantial evidence to support the conviction. The court also found the statute did not impinge on any fundamental right of appellant and, therefore, was not subject to the &quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard necessary to invoke a compelling interest of the state to enact the statute. Further, the court found that the state had a compelling interest in saving lives and promoting the welfare of its citizens and held that California's mandatory seat belt law served that purpose and was constitutional.

The court noted that there was an ambiguity in the statute but held that appellant's construction did not fit with the legislative and judicial history of the school loitering statute.

She sought review by challenging the constitutionality of the municipal rent rollback ordinance. The court affirmed, finding that the municipal ordinance was constitutional as a valid exercise of the police power. The court overruled appellant's argument that because the prior county ordinance had fixed the housing shortage, there was no basis for the municipal ordinance, finding that the city council had declared a housing shortage existed and appellant had not shown otherwise. The court rejected the argument that the ordinance unconstitutionally impaired existing contracts, finding that some impairment can occur in order to accommodate the state's power to safeguard the interest of its people, and that the threshold inquiry was whether the enactment in fact substantially impaired contractual rights. The court found that the ordinance was to last six months, rents were fixed to a level less than four months preceding the date of enactment, and rents had been controlled for at least five years before and held that its effect on contractual rights appeared to be insignificant.</SPAN></P>

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 16240 or Los Angeles County Code &sect; 7.140.020(B). Defendants appealed contending the standards in the Los Angeles County Code &sect; 22.56.190, for the issuance of a permit and license were vague and the procedures involved in obtaining a permit and license constituted an impermissible prior restraint. The court affirmed the trial court's convictions. First, the court held the wording of the aforementioned statute was not unconstitutionally vague and clearly prohibited adult bookstores and arcades that interfered with other uses. Secondly, the court held although no time limits were articulated in the code regarding permit and licensing procedures, defendants were not deprived their due process rights. Further, the court reasoned the city could limit the types of activities within its boundaries.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, the City of Santa Barbara, prosecuted 38 defendant transients for violating Santa Barbara, Cal. Municipal Code &sect; 15.16.085, which prohibited sleeping in certain areas at certain times. The trial court sustained defendants' common demurrer, and declared &sect; 15.16.085 unconstitutional. On appeal, the City argued that the trial court did not follow established constitutional principles. The court agreed, and upheld the constitutionality of the ordinance. Since defendants were not engaged in any activity to which sleeping could be appended as expressive conduct, U.S. Const. amend. I was not implicated, and &sect; 15.16.085 could not be deemed overbroad. &sect; 15.16.085 was not void for vagueness, because it was clear of discernment to both enforcer and violator. In addition, the hypothetical situations considered by the trial court on the vagueness issue did not meet the required constitutional scrutiny. The legitimate purposes served by &sect; 15.16.085, which formed a reasonable relation to the proscribed activity of sleeping, were also ignored by the trial court. Accordingly, the order was reversed, and the case remanded with directions to overrule the demurrer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The people appealed an order from the Municipal Court for the East Los Angeles Judicial District of Los Angeles County (California), which sustained defendant's demurrer to a complaint charging him with a violation of the Commerce, Cal., Mun.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a violation of the Commerce, Cal., Mun. Code &sect; 9.16.053 for carrying knives or dirks in plain view. A trial court sustained defendant's demurrer to the complaint and dismissed the case. The people appealed. The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the case with directions to vacate the trial court's order sustaining defendant's demurrer because the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer. From a review of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 653k and its legislative history, the court concluded that the legislature intended to except the particular types of knives that defendant had from local regulation. Thus, city ordinance's attempt to proscribe such knives directly conflicted with state law covering the same subject matter. The court found, however, that the invalid portion of the ordinance was severable from the remainder of the ordinance. The court determined that local regulation of knives, dirks, or daggers carried or worn in plain view was not precluded by virtue of state preemption of the field. Accordingly, the court concluded that &sect; 9.16.053 was not invalid as a usurpation of the state's prerogative in that area.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11364.7(a). This statute referred to a definition of &quot;drug paraphernalia&quot; found at Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11014.5, which contained the phrases designed for use, marketed for use, and reasonably should know, all of which distinguished drug paraphernalia from other kinds of smoking products. Defendants sold bongs, roach clips, coke kits, coke spoons, and scales. Defendants claimed that the statute was a violation of due process and was void for vagueness because it did not sufficiently describe the conduct that was prohibited, and encouraged arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court affirmed defendants' conviction and held that although &sect; 11014.5 disclosed no overt scienter requirement, &sect; 11364.7(a) exhibited a double scienter standard.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Since we have decided this case on the basis that the statute unduly burdens interstate commerce, we need not address the question of whether or not the statute violates the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as claimed by appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a resident of Arizona, challenged a determination by the Justice Court for the Needles-Calzona Judicial District of San Bernardino County (California), that found him guilty of operating a vehicle with its front side windows tinted in violation of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a resident of Arizona, was found guilty of violating Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 26708(a) because the front side windows on the car he drove from Arizona to California were tinted. On review, appellant claimed that &sect; 26708(a) was unconstitutional because it restricted his freedom to travel, and its burden on interstate commerce was excessive in relation to any local putative benefits. Appellant also argued that the statute violated the privileges and immunities clause of the U.S. Constitution. The court agreed, and held that &sect; 26708(a) was unconstitutional. The court applied a balancing test and determined that the legitimate interest of respondent, the State of California, to promote highway safety was not outweighed by the substantial burden that &sect; 26708(a) imposed upon interstate commerce. The court noted that appellant produced evidence that highway safety and citizen health were actually enhanced by tinted windows, but respondent virtually defaulted in its defense of &sect; 26708(a) as a safety measure. Accordingly, the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, because respondent, the State of California, made no showing that the statute that prohibited tinted windows contributed to highway safety, although the burden imposed upon interstate commerce by the prohibition of tinted windows was substantial. The statute that appellant Arizona resident was found guilty of violating was therefore unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Respondent arcade owner and others were charged with violation of &sect; 103.101(g). The trial court sustained their demurrer challenging the constitutionality of the regulation. On appeal, appellant prosecution contended that the ordinance constituted a valid exercise of the police power to regulate the interior visibility of arcade booths and that the possibility of some adverse impact upon the economic operation of an arcade or upon the right of privacy did not foreclose exercise of that power, and that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague. The court reversed the order of dismissal and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings because &sect; 103.101(g), was a precise, and reasonable time, place, and manner restriction on conduct that did not prohibit the free expression of speech or invade anyone's right of privacy.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant mobilehome park tenants sought review of a judgment for plaintiff landlord in an unlawful detainer action, which alleged that defendants breached their lease agreement by permitting their child to reside in the mobilehome park.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Municipal Court for the Los Angeles Judicial District of Los Angeles County (California), entered upon a jury verdict, convicting him of unlawfully entering a park after hours, in violation of Los Angeles, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 63.44(B)(14), thereby rejecting his due process challenge to the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after 11 p.m., police observed defendant drive into a park that had posted signs indicating that the park was closed between 10:30 p.m. and 5 a.m. Defendant used the public restroom and walked near some trees before he was stopped and charged with violating Los Angeles, Cal., Municipal Code &sect; 63.44(B)(14), which prohibited entering, remaining, staying, or &quot;loitering&quot; in a park after hours. Defendant was convicted and he appealed, arguing that the ordinance was a antiloitering law that violated due process. In affirming the conviction, the court ruled that the ordinance was not an antiloitering law, but was a park closure law that gave sufficient notice of the conduct proscribed and it was neither overbroad nor void for vagueness. It did not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement or unduly restrict personal rights. Rather, the ordinance was a reasonable regulatory provision that was substantially related to and advanced legitimate government interests in protecting natural resources and public health, safety, and welfare in the usage of parks. The city had authority to control use of its parks and to impose time, place, and manner restrictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was affirmed because the applicable ordinance was not an antiloitering provision that failed to give notice, or void for vagueness or overbreadth, but was simply a regulatory and reasonable park closure law that was enacted as a time, place, and manner restriction pursuant to the police power to further legitimate governmental interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of failure to secure a child passenger in a seat restraint system in violation of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 27360(a). Defendant contended that the statute was an unconstitutional interference with her fundamental rights of family privacy and parental autonomy. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that the statute did not infringe on her fundamental right to family privacy. The court noted that the right to family privacy was directed to the integrity of the family unit which was at stake when the state attempted to regulate the custody, care, and nurturing of a child. The court did find that requiring defendant to ensure that her children used seat restraints related to the &quot;care&quot; of children in the sense that it ensured safe transportation of the children. However, the court found that ensuring safe transportation of children was not the type of &quot;care&quot; encompassed by the fundamental right to family privacy, as the statute did not affect the integrity of defendant's family unit. Finally, the court found that the required use of seat restraints for children was a reasonable regulation under the police power in the interest of public safety and welfare.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that the statute requiring her to secure her children in seat restraints did not violate her fundamental right to family privacy because ensuring the safe transportation of children was not the type of care encompassed by the right to family privacy, as the regulation did not affect the integrity of the family unit. The court also found that the statute was reasonably related to its purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution appealed from an order of the Municipal Court for the Los Angeles Judicial District of Los Angeles County (California), granting defendant shop manager's motion to suppress evidence of drug paraphernalia seized by police. Prosecution alleged that &quot;drug paraphernalia&quot; under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11014.5 was misinterpreted and that only evidence out of plain view should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police seized various items from a drug paraphernalia shop on the basis that defendant shop manager committed a violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11364.7(a) by offering items for sale which were intended for use with controlled substances. Some items were seized from locked cases not in open view to the public. On appeal from an order suppressing all evidence, the court held that the suppression ruling was erroneous in two significant respects. Initially, the trial court erred in its interpretation of what constituted &quot;drug paraphernalia&quot; under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11014.5. The plain language of &sect; 11014.5 refuted the trial court's conclusion that the definition of &quot;drug paraphernalia&quot; was limited to those items specifically listed in that section. The court also found that the trial court erred by failing to make specific findings as to which of the seized items were properly seized in plain view and which were not. Therefore the commingling of evidence legally and illegally seized did not excuse the trial court from its duty to make specific findings as to those items which had to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The suppression order was reversed and the case remanded to the trial court with instructions to determine which of the seized items were in plain view, which were not, and which fell within the parameters of &quot;drug paraphernalia,&quot; as defined by Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11014.5, and to make appropriate findings in that regard.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court found that plaintiff employer had the prerogative of either paying the amounts found to be owing by the labor commissioner or petitioning for a review of that decision in the trial court within 10 days. The court concluded that defendant was not entitled to punitive damages, because plaintiff chose the avenue of appeal and &sect; 206(b) was never activated. The court found that defendant did not commence an action by filing a claim with the labor commissioner within the meaning of Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 203, so the trial court should have awarded waiting time penalties to defendant. The court concluded that the trial below was held de novo and the trial judge was not required to compare his order with the findings of the labor commissioner. The court found that defendant prevailed in her action for unpaid wages, so she was entitled to attorney's fees and costs pursuant to Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 98.2. The court concluded that plaintiff's vacation policy for its employees and its written contract with defendant granted her rights to both vacation and severance pay.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Five defendants were prosecuted for violating Los Angeles, Cal.

They demurred to the charges, contending that the ordinance was overbroad and unconstitutionally infringed on their U.S. Const. amend. I rights to free expression. The court reversed and remanded the trial court's dismissals and orders sustaining the demurrers. The court held that the ordinance was facially constitutional because it regulated nonspeech conduct and only incidentally affected expressive conduct. The court noted that the ordinance was enacted for the proper purpose of preventing personal injuries during demonstrations by the use of demonstration equipment, reflecting a governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression, and the incidental resulting restriction on free expression was no greater than necessary to further the governmental interest in avoiding physical harm to others. The court also ruled that the ordinance was not so substantially overbroad as to warrant a judgment striking it down for that reason.</SPAN></P>

The business in question was operated for profit and an entry fee was charged. The business provided a large, communal type, indoor jacuzzi, showers, and saunas, as well as linens, towels, mattresses, and other bedding. Appellants argued on appeal that U.S. Const. amend. I and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 2 exempted the business from the requirement of a health club license, and that no such license was required since the business did not fall within the definition of a health club under the ordinance.

The court on appeal affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's motion, holding that the territorial restriction in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1462 was waivable &quot;territorial jurisdiction,&quot; not non-waivable &quot;subject matter jurisdiction,&quot; such that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the misdemeanor offense even if it was outside the county where the offense was committed. Nevertheless, the motion for a new trial was properly denied because defendant's act of passing through Los Angeles County in the course of committing the offense established the trial court's jurisdiction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Municipal Court for the San Bernardino County Judicial District of San Bernardino County (California), which convicted him of violating Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 19401. Appellant claimed that Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 19401 was unconstitutional because it created a strict liability statute, and there was no evidence presented that he intended to evade payment of state income taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for failing to file state income tax returns in violation of Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 19401, claiming the statute was unconstitutional because it created strict liability and because the state failed to show he intended to evade payment. Appellant alleged that, because Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 19401 did not require scienter, it violated due process requirements. The court held that, although criminal statutes were not often construed to impose sanctions in the absence of intent, an exception occurred where the statute was an expression of a legislative policy to be served by strict liability, and that the duty to file an income tax return fell within those regulatory offenses. Because the power to tax was within the state's police power and because the ordinary taxpayer was in a position to know what the consequences of failing to file a return were, the court held Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 19401 was not unconstitutional based on due process. The court also found that, because intent was not an element of the offense, there was no requirement to show intent; therefore, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Appellant's conviction for failing to file state income tax returns was upheld because the statute was not unconstitutional based on due process where it was an expression of legislative policy to be served by strict liability and where an ordinary taxpayer was in a position to know the consequences of failing to file a return.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in a misdemeanor complaint with knowingly and willfully for profit manufacturing, distributing and selling a decoding device, not authorized by a licensed subscription service, which enabled television sets to unscramble subscription television audiovisual signals in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 593e. Defendant filed a notice of hearing on demurrer to the complaint, and the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend upon the grounds that the field was preempted by the Federal Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 605 (1934). The state appealed. On review, the court reversed and held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 593e was a state law that attempted to regulate the same subject as a federal law. That fact, alone, had not subjected it to a status of invalidity unless it was inconsistent with federal law. The court found that the state statute acted to further the purposes of 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 605 (1934), and had not conflicted with nor stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. Therefore federal law had not preempted &sect; 593e.</SPAN></P>

The court granted the state's petition for rehearing to determine the question of interplay between diversion statutes and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1382.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court imposed a number of maximum consecutive misdemeanor sentences in county jail that totaled four years and three months, for defendant's convictions relating to his driving under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. Defendant appealed the denial of his motion to suppress. Defendant had been taken from the scene of an accident in an ambulance. The officers found him unconscious on a hospital bed, placed him under arrest while he was unconscious and requested a blood sample. The court held that the arrest of defendant while he was unconscious was not lawful. However, the seizure of his blood was lawful based on the &quot;exigencies of the situation.&quot; Defendant's unconscious state made it impossible to comply with Cal. Penal Code &sect; 841 by telling defendant he was under arrest. The blood test had to be taken when it was, in order to avoid the &quot;destruction&quot; of the evidence by the passage of time. There was ample probable cause to believe defendant was under the influence of intoxicants. The officer acted properly in ordering the blood test.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, defendants appealed the judgment of the Municipal Court for the San Bernardino County Judicial District, Central Division, of San Bernardino County (California) after it convicted them of violating Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, defendants challenged the lower court judgment that convicted them of violating Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152(b). Defendant's argued that &sect; 23152(b) was unconstitutionally vague; that &sect; 23152(b) was also unconstitutional because it was a criminal statute that imposed strict liability on a defendant; that enhancement of penalties for violation of &sect; 23152(b) based on prior convictions under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23102(a) was not authorized by the statute and, therefore, failed to provide adequate notice to defendants that they might have violated the law; and that the prior convictions under &sect; 23102(a) were invalid because inadequate waivers of rights were obtained from defendants. The lower court judgment was affirmed. The court held that &sect; 23152(b) was not unconstitutionally vague. Section 23152 imposed general liability, not strict liability. The statutes establishing punishment for a defendant convicted of &sect; 23152(b) with prior convictions did not have the effect of being ex post facto laws. Prior convictions were properly used by the lower court to enhance the sentences of two of the defendants for violating &sect; 21352(b).</SPAN></P>

The statute at issue was not an invalid strict liability criminal statute, but was a general intent statute. Enhancing the punishment for having a prior driving under the influence conviction was not ex post facto.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While defendant's car was illegally parked, a police officer observed a gun in between the front seats. The police officer asked a parking attendant to open the car door so that the police officer could examine the gun. The police officer returned the gun after examining it. After defendant drove away in his car, the police officer stopped him, observed the gun, and arrested him. Defendant pleaded guilty to illegally carrying a loaded firearm after the trial court denied his motion to suppress the gun as the product of an illegal search. The court affirmed and held that the police officer did not need to request permission before entering the vehicle to examine the firearm pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12031(e). The court held that &sect; 12031(e) provided probable cause for a police officer to examine a firearm to determine whether it was loaded when it was located in a place where loaded guns were prohibited. With probable cause to examine the firearm when it was located in a vehicle, a police officer could seize it and examine it by any means reasonably available.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted in separate trials in different courts of lewd and dissolute conduct in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(a). The appeals were consolidated for publication to interpret the elements of &sect; 647(a). The court held that the statute was directed at sexually motivated conduct by defendant involving touching of the genitals, buttocks, or female breast in any public place, or any place open to the public or exposed to public view. The court held that &sect; 647(a) was not limited to actor's touching of his genitals in view of another for the purpose of the actor's sexual arousal or gratification but also applied where the act was done for the purpose of the sexual arousal of the viewer. The court held that the requirement that defendant knew or should have known of the presence of a person who may have been offended had two parts: whether defendant knew or should have known of another person's presence and whether defendant should have known that his conduct may have offended another. The court held that the state had little interest in prohibiting the conduct if there were no persons present who may have been offended. The court affirmed the convictions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of driving while under the influence of alcohol. He challenged the conviction and raised various arguments on appeal, including the argument that the jury was improperly instructed and that his blood alcohol tests were inadmissible at trial. On review the trial court affirmed the conviction. The court held that there was justification for defendant to be detained for sobriety testing, because he was weaving while driving extremely slow. The court also held that the police department's failure to make printouts from its forensic lab quality control samples available to defendant so that he could test the reliability of his testing did not warrant suppression of his blood alcohol test results. The court further held that the lower court did not err when it refused to instruct the jury to disregard defendant's test results if they found that the police department violated procedure when they destroyed the quality control printouts, because such failure to comply with procedure would only have affected the weight of the test results rather than the admissibility of the results.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Twenty-two dogs, one cat and five horses were seized from defendant kennel operator's home pursuant to a search warrant.

Penal Code &sect; 597f, and maintaining a kennel without a license, Los Angeles, Cal., Code &sect; 53.50. Defendant sought review. The court affirmed. The court held that the warrant's affidavits were sufficient to show probable cause, that the magistrate was free to reject evidence in conflict with the affidavit, and that it was for the magistrate to determine whether the evidence of a citizen-informant was to be believed. The court held that the information in the warrant was not stale, because defendant's business of operating a kennel required some degree of permanency in its location and operation and one month before the warrant's execution defendant was involved in a dog show. The court held that the trial court did not err by finding that evidence seized beyond that specified in the search warrant was nonetheless related to a crime.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city adopted an ordinance that required deposits on malt beverage or soft drink containers. Appellants, retail grocers doing business in city, challenged the constitutionality of the ordinance on the basis that it was unconstitutionally vague, internally inconsistent, and that it deprived them of equal protection of the laws. The trial court struck section 2c(3) from the ordinance upon finding it was inconsistent with the balance of the ordinance because retailers complying with section 2c(2) by issuing coupons would still be required to accept and pay for the return of any nonrefillable in accordance with section 2c(3). The trial court upheld the remainder of the ordinance. Appellants contended on appeal that striking 2c(3) could not preserve the remainder of the ordinance because the entire ordinance was fundamentally inconsistent and invalid. The reviewing court rejected appellants' contention and found that that section 2c(3) could be stricken from the ordinance while the remainder stood. The court also affirmed the trial court finding that the ordinance would reduce litter and waste and that the ordinance was rationally related to the end sought to be achieved.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was charged with violating Cal.

The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer and entered an order of dismissal. On appeal, the court reversed the order of dismissal. Although the term &quot;lewd and lascivious&quot; was required to be redefined, the term &quot;loiter&quot; as used in &sect; 647(d) was not constitutionally overbroad, and that if defendant's activities were in a public toilet, then he could not be heard to complain that &sect; 647(d) was vague as applied to him. In addition, the court found that &sect; 647(d) proscribed loitering for the purpose of committing a lewd act, and that its elements could be established by both direct and circumstantial evidence, without a showing that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647(a) had been violated. Further, the court found that &sect; 647(d) was designed to prevent loitering for a lewd purpose, and did not punish status as opposed to an actual offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders dismissing the charge of disorderly conduct and sustaining the demurrer on that charge because the terms loitering, in or about, and lewd and lascivious as used in the statute were neither overbroad nor vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Municipal Court for the San Francisco Judicial District of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which granted defendant probation on the condition that he make restitution to a third party for damage to the third party's automobile that he allegedly caused.

Veh. Code &sect; 20002(a), and placed on probation with the condition that he pay restitution for damage to a third party's vehicle. Defendant appealed the imposition of the restitution condition. The court held that the trial court abused its discretion in conditioning defendant's probation on the payment of restitution, and therefore the court reversed and remanded the case. The court held that defendant was convicted of the intentional act of leaving the scene of an accident in which property damage had occurred and there was no evidence in the record to show that the property damage arose from criminal conduct. Therefore, the court reasoned that the restitution order required payment for damage that was caused by noncriminal conduct. The court found that no rehabilitative purpose was served by the restitution order. However, the court held that it would not be an abuse of discretion for a trial court to order restitution as long as the defendant was given the opportunity to present evidence at the sentencing hearing that rebutted his civil liability.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant used the designation of M.D. but was not a licensed physician in the state of California. Appellant was convicted of violating Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 2142, 2142.10. On appeal, appellant argued that his conviction should be reversed because the statutes were unconstitutional, that evidence was insufficient, that acts of prosecution prejudiced his case, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, that the trial court erred in excluding evidence of estoppel, and that instructions to the jury were error where the offenses charged were general intent crimes. The court affirmed the conviction under &sect; 2142 and held that its restriction on commercial speech was relatively narrow and that it related to an important state interest. The court reversed the conviction under &sect; 2142.10 and held that evidence was uncontradicted that appellant stated he gave up practice of medicine. The court held that appellant waived any complaint on appeal as to prosecutorial misconduct and that his attorney's failure to object was usually attributed to tactical decisions and seldom established counsel's incompetence.

Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in denying his motion to declare the prior conviction unconstitutional. The court affirmed the judgment, holding that defendant waived his constitutional rights before his plea was accepted and any defect in respect of his admission of a prior conviction charged in connection with the prior offense did not affect the conviction itself. The court ruled that no presently declared rule of law required that defendant be advised of and expressly waive his right to use a court's subpoena power. The court held that the record indicated that defendant was advised of the legal and factual defenses available to him before entering a guilty plea. Finally, the court determined that defendant freely and intelligently waived his constitutional rights. The trial judge conducted a detailed interrogation of defendant prior to accepting his plea, which was recorded in the reporter's transcript, and the judge's failure to articulate orally such an express finding did not invalidate the conviction.</SPAN></P>

Respondent's demurrer was sustained by the trial court without leave to amend on the basis that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad and the trial court dismissed the case.

The court concluded that, although there was a compelling state interest in insuring the integrity of elections, the statute was a flat prohibition of the creation or distribution of a class of written material regardless of the innocence of motive, the truth of the written material or the harmlessness of the activity. The mere unsigned reference to an election of a candidate or a measure on a ballot could be a crime under the terms of the statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed an order that granted respondent's motion to suppress evidence seized under a search warrant. Appellant state obtained a warrant to seize two motion pictures based on the affidavit of a police officer that described one frame of a motion picture or one drawing and stated that the same scenes were contained in the film that also contained depictions of sexual acts. The court held that there was not sufficient information to establish probable cause to believe the films were obscene, taken as a whole, when the affidavit did not describe the contents of the films with a detailed pictorial work description of the film's continuity. The court rejected appellant's argument that a warrant could be based on one obscene photograph or drawing contained in a film. The court held that one police officer's conclusory statements, without further description of the film as a whole, did not satisfy probable cause requirements.</SPAN></P>

The municipal court issued an order for appellant sheriff to levy upon, publish and sell respondent debtor's real property. The municipal court denied appellant's motion to vacate the order on the grounds that it was null and void because procedures mandated by Cal. Civ. Proc.

The court noted that prior to the enactment of &sect; 690.31, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 690.235 (repealed 1977) was applicable to claims of exemptions for dwelling houses and that the substantive exemptions allowed were almost identical.

Although compliance with &sect; 647(ff) was not an element of the offense, once defendant raised the issue of the people's failure to place him in a detoxification center in light of that statute's mandatory language and benign purposes the people were required to establish their reasonable inability to comply with &sect; 647(ff). Among the factors to be taken into account in determining the ability to comply were limitations of space, time, and money.

In support of its ruling, the court held that in order to determine whether a law impermissibly attempted to regulate the content of speech, courts must assess the importance of the governmental objective. If the objective was important, courts must see if it was necessary to use that particular method to achieve the objective. If the method was necessary courts finally balanced the governmental objective against the First Amendment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants all pled guilty or nolo contendere to violating Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11550. The statute required a mandatory 90-day minimum sentence. In each of the cases, however, the trial courts suspended sentence and placed defendants on probation. The court reversed the orders. Contrary to defendants' arguments, the fact that defendants faced the prospect of increased punishment upon resentencing did not violate the principles of double jeopardy, U.S. Const. amend. V. Sentences that did not comply with the letter of the criminal statute were not only erroneous but also void. Therefore, such sentences could have been corrected in conformity with the provisions of the statute without violating double jeopardy principles.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted a defense motion in arrest of judgment and dismissed an action brought by the people to enforce an ordinance, and the people appealed.

That section required the board of police commissioners to issue a permit before anyone could operate a &quot;social club.&quot; The trial courts involved concluded that the section was unconstitutional, and the reviewing court agreed and affirmed. The court determined that nothing in the ordinance restricted the use of the term &quot;social club&quot; to any meaningful degree. The people contended that the main purpose of social clubs, as defined by &sect; 103.103.1, was to provide recreation and amusement and not communication or advancement of ideas and beliefs. The court found that the contention could not be upheld in light of the broad definition given to &quot;social club&quot; by the ordinance itself and the principles of law set forth in prior case law.</SPAN></P>

A previous challenge to the statute based on violations of the U.S. Const. amend. I, in defining lewd or dissolute acts as obscene acts, had failed. A later court made an exception for theatrical performances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff judgment creditor obtained a default judgment against defendant judgment debtor on April 23, 1975 and recorded an abstract of judgment on February 17, 1976 in the county where defendant owned a house.

Plaintiff brought suit to have the trial court determine the defendant's claim of exemption. The trial court found for defendant and the court reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 1174 required employers of labor in the state to keep employee records and to furnish access to such records to the Division of Industrial Welfare (California) (division). Cal. Lab.

After an employee of the division told defendant that he wished to examine his employee records, pursuant to the provisions set forth under &sect; 1174, and defendant allowed the review but limited the time duration thereof, the division issued a subpoena requiring production of the records. Defendant refused to comply, the state filed a misdemeanor action, and the trial court found that &sect;&sect; 1174(b) and 1175(b) were unconstitutional. The court agreed and affirmed the dismissal. The court provided that a party subject to administrative subpoena was entitled to judicial review, that such subpoena could not be enforced by an inspector in the field, and that warrantless searches were limited to emergency situations or to the regulation of businesses likely to give rise to public danger.

Respondents demanded that the appellants post security pursuant to the provisions of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1030, on the ground that each was a nonresident. Appellants did not post security and respondents' motion to dismiss for such failure was granted. Appellants challenged the dismissal on the ground that &sect; 1030 was unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 1030 was unconstitutional in that it lacked procedural due process elements. The court determined that &sect; 1030 must provide a meaningful pretaking hearing. The court held that the posting of security for the benefit of another, of the kind demanded by respondents, was a &quot;taking&quot; for which procedural due process required prior procedural safeguards.

At the subsequent trial, a police officer testified he observed defendant solicit two persons to pay for transportation to Mexico in his car. The prosecution then rested without presenting evidence that defendant was not authorized by law to provide such transportation or that he was not in possession of a valid license or permit to act as a carrier. After trial, the jury found defendant guilty, and the trial court entered judgment. Defendant then appealed, raising several issues including the unfairness of the jury selection process. On appeal, the court reversed because the prosecution failed to provide any basis for the system of jury selection; therefore, the prosecution failed to meet its burden of justifying the challenged classification.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's sole contention on appeal was that his conduct did not constitute a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12025 in that the weapon was not carried concealed upon his person. Defendant did not dispute the fact that the weapon was both carried and concealed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed from an order of the Municipal Court for the Inglewood Judicial District of Los Angeles County (California), dismissing count II of the complaint, a violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 5402, after defendant's demurrer to that count was sustained.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with a violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 5402, which prohibited the display on an advertising sign or structure of any picture or illustration of a human figure in such detail as to offend public morals and decency. Defendant asked the court to construe the statute as applying to a depiction of such conduct as would constitute an indecent exposure or obscene exhibition in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 314, or lewd or dissolute conduct in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647, subd. (a). The court affirmed the dismissal of that portion of the complaint charging defendant with violation of Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 5402, and found that the terms &quot;public decency&quot; and &quot;public morals&quot; had previously been found unconstitutionally vague and they were bound by that determination in a criminal prosecution. The court found that had the legislature not deliberately omitted the word obscene in &sect; 5402, that word in connection with public morals and decency might have been enough to withstand constitutional attack but such was not the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order dismissing count II of the complaint against defendant, charging him with offending public morals and decency, because the statute under which he was charged was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the State of California, sought review of decisions in three consolidated cases from the Municipal Court for the Citrus Judicial District of Los Angeles County (California), dismissing defendants' misdemeanor convictions for violating Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 1707.1, to wit, selling laetriles for cancer treatment, and holding the statute unconstitutional under U. S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, cl. 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the trial court's dismissal of misdemeanor counts against defendants in three consolidated cases for distributing laetriles, food compounds popularly believed to be effective in the treatment of cancer. The trial court held that Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 1707.1 was unconstitutionally vague and violated the due process guarantees of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, cl. 6, and U. S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the court held that the statute gave persons of reasonable intelligence notice that selling any &quot;drug, medicine, compound, or device to used in the diagnosis, treatment, alleviation or cure of cancer&quot; was banned unless the substance was approved for cancer treatment by state or federal authorities. The legislature clearly intended to embrace all unapproved substances, not just those proven harmful but also those not proven effective. The statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad nor did it invade citizens' rights to privacy or equal protection of the law because the state had broad police power to protect the public health. The court reversed and reinstated defendants' misdemeanor convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment that a state statute prohibiting the sale of laetriles for the treatment of cancer unless first approved by state and federal authorities was unconstitutionally overbroad or vague. The statute fell within the ambit of the state's broad police power to protect the public health and did not infringe on cancer patients' rights to privacy, due process, or equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
