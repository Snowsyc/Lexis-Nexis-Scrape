</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a school district tax collector and others, sought review of a judgment from the District Court, Harris County (Texas), which granted a temporary injunction restraining the tax collector and others from conducting a &quot;summary sale&quot; of appellee property owners' land for delinquent taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court granted the injunction in favor of the property owners based on their contention that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. art. 7328a provided that a sale of real estate for the collection of delinquent taxes could be made only after a foreclosure of the tax lien in a court of competent jurisdiction. The tax collector appealed, challenging the constitutionality of art. 7328a. The court affirmed the district court's judgment, concluding that Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect;&sect; 13 and 15, when construed together, permitted the legislature to determine the method for the sale of land for delinquent taxes and that the language in the constitution referencing a &quot;speedy sale&quot; did not mandate the legislature to allow the type of summary sale sought by the tax collector and did not prevent the legislature from requiring lien foreclosures and judicial sales. The court noted that to agree with the tax collector would mean that a speedy judicial sale did not exist. The court noted that Tex. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 13 was subsequently amended in 1932 to add the crucial language of &quot;without the necessity of a suit in court&quot; but that such amendment did not apply to the property owners' action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator picketers instituted an original habeas corpus proceeding seeking their release from the custody of respondent county sheriff under an order of the trial court (Texas) punishing the picketers for contempt committed by violating the trial court's temporary injunction against picketing an area adjacent to an employer's plant and a nearby railroad spur.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The picketers violated the trial court's order by picketing in a street within 100 feet of tracks used by railway employees to transport freight into a plant owned by the employer involved in the labor dispute and urging the railway employees &quot;not to serve&quot; the plant. The court concluded that the conduct held contemptuous because it violated the trial court's injunction amounted to peaceful picketing which was both lawful and protected by the U.S. Const. amends. I, XIV. As the picketing was otherwise lawful, the court declined to enjoin the picketing merely because the employer alleged that the railroad's rights were adversely affected. So long as the pickets did not obstruct the spur tracks and thereby nullify or seriously impair the railroad's right to use the adjacent street, they had the same right to use the street as the railways had, consistent with peculiar and essential differences in the means and manner of its use by them and by the railways. Although the trial court had authority to enjoin labor union activities considered unlawful against its citizen, the facts were insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the trial court to hold the picketers in contempt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the picketers discharged from custody.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners sought review of the decision of the Court of Civil Appeals for the Eleventh District (Texas), which affirmed the trial court's finding that voters who failed to obtain new poll tax exemption certificates were not qualified voters and their votes were illegal. Petitioners contended that the amendment to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2968, which required new certificates annually, was invalid because its caption was overly broad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2960 exempted every person over the age of 60 from the payment of the poll tax. The subject voters were more than 60 years old, and they had obtained original poll tax exemption certificates as required by art. 2968. The court reversed the decisions of the trial court and the appellate court finding that the voters did not lose their voting rights by failing to comply with the renewal process. Although the court found that art. 2968 was not invalid on the basis of its amendment's broad caption, the court found that the amended article did not specify that voters would forfeit their voting rights by failing to comply with the renewal process and that the voters could not lose their fundamental voting rights by implication. The court found that the provision for procuring annual certificates should be construed as directory rather than mandatory because the essential purpose was accomplished when the voters obtained their original exemption certificates to document their tax exemption. The court concluded that its construction of art. 2968 was supported by an Attorney General's opinion and the legislature's failure to clarify or change the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgments of the appellate court and the trial court finding that the subject voters were qualified voters and their votes were legal. The court rendered judgment declaring and adjudging that a majority of the qualified electors who voted in the election described in the pleadings voted against the local maintenance tax and against the bond issue submitted in the election and that both of said issues failed to carry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cab companies challenged a judgment from the Court of Civil Appeals for the Fourth District (Texas), which modified the trial court's judgment against defendant city in an action to enjoin the city from collecting gross receipt taxes, license fees, or street rental fees. The cab companies also sought to enjoin enforcement of penal and forfeiture provisions of the ordinance and a declaration that provisions of the ordinance were invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The cab companies claimed that they were entitled to a return of the payments made to the city of the fees created by the invalid ordinance because those payments were made under duress. The city contended that they did not make the payments under compulsion or duress. The trial court decreed certain portions of the ordinance invalid and unenforceable in so far as the assessment, levy, and collection of taxes and the license or street rental fees were concerned. The trial court also enjoined to city from attempted to collect such taxes and fees. The trial court ordered that the cab companies were entitled to recover amounts paid to the city. The appellate court reformed the judgment to deny the cab companies recovery for payments made under the ordinances. On appeal, the court held that the judgment of the trial court was in all things correct. The cab companies were entitled to a repayment of the fees because the fees were paid to the city under the pressure of the particular means employed for its collection, which were tantamount to compulsion or duress. It would have been against good conscious for the city not to pay back to the cab companies the money thus received.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and set aside that portion of the judgment from the appellate court that reformed the trial court's judgment to provide that no recovery be had by the cab companies for taxes and charges theretofore paid to the city. The court rendered a judgment to affirm in toto the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The carrier operated a motor coach business in the area outside El Paso.

The trial court entered a judgment for the carrier. That decision was reversed by the intermediate court. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part and remanded to the trial court with instructions. The court held that the intermediate court had correctly reversed the trial court because it had improvidently restrained the competitor from operating in the suburbs of El Paso, which fell within the territory that was excepted from regulation by the Railroad Commission under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 911a (1925).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for a shipbuilding company, and his duties included both new construction and repair of ships. At the time of the injury, the employee was working on the repair and modification of an old barge. It was not shown that the barge had been used in navigation or that it had ever been commissioned or licensed for such use. The employee sought to recover compensation under state law. The employer took no action under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Act, 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 901 et seq., and did not controvert payment in the manner prescribed in that act. The court concluded that the employee's work could not be classified, as a matter of law, as work of such a maritime nature as to bring the case exclusively under the jurisdiction of a court of admiralty. The court observed that Congress intended to uphold state compensation protection by making federal law applicable only where state law could not validly provide recovery through compensation proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city bought property at a foreclosure sale following a judgment in a lawsuit it brought against the original landowners for taxes. It sold the property to the owners. The state filed an action against the city and the owners to recover state and county taxes. The lower court reformed a judgment denying the state a recovery and allowed the state to recover 8/12ths of 1945 taxes. In all other respects, the lower court upheld the judgment. The court affirmed the lower court's order. It held that the state was a party to the tax lawsuit, and a sale under foreclosure in the lawsuit operated to extinguish its claims for taxes that had become delinquent at the time the judgment was rendered. When the taxing units acquired the property at the judicial sale, the liens for taxes held by the state were merged into the title acquired by the taxing units. The rights of those entitled to redeem expired by their failure to make a timely and adequate tender. The only interest in the land was that acquired by the taxing units and conveyed by them to the owners.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the trial court, Dallas County (Texas). A jury convicted defendant upon his guilty plea, under an indictment charging theft of property valued at $ 20.00 or more but less than $ 200.00. The indictment further alleged two prior convictions of theft of property valued at $ 50.00 or more. Defendant urged that Tex. Penal Code &sect; 31.03(d)(4)(C) violated U.S. Const. amends.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from his conviction by a jury, upon his guilty plea, under an indictment charging theft of property valued at $ 20.00 or more but less than $ 200.00. The indictment further alleged two prior convictions of theft of property of the value of $ 50.00 or more. Defendant argued that he was charged with a felony under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 31.03(d)(4)(C), not because he was guilty of the present offense, a Class A misdemeanor under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 31.03(d)(3), but because he committed such offense along with past offenses. He maintained that he was being tried for all three offenses and, thus, he urged that &sect; 31.03(d)(4)(C) was unconstitutional under the U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV and Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 9, as it violated due process and placed him in double jeopardy. The court affirmed his conviction on grounds that the addition of the prior theft convictions in the instant case created a new offense of the grade of felony under &sect; 31.03(d)(4)(C) and vested the district court with jurisdiction and, thus, &sect; 31.03(d)(4)(C) was not violative of due process nor did it place defendant in double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

Although prior convictions were taken into account under the challenged statute, the statute had the effect of creating a new offense with a higher range of penalty and did not violate due process nor place him in double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, finding that it was not incumbent upon the trial court to withdraw appellant's plea under the circumstances of this case because the evidence did not suggest appellant's innocence of the crime charged. The court also found that the evidence did not raise the issue of criminally negligent homicide. The court noted that when appellant entered a guilty plea to involuntary manslaughter, the plea admitted the existence of all incriminating facts necessary to establish guilt.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded and held that the trial court's error was prejudicial and deprived appellant of a fair and impartial trial when it failed to incorporate the requested charges and advised the jury that the charges were those of appellant. The jurors were permitted to find appellant guilty whether they found evidence of lawful or unlawful negligence because no distinction was made in the charge. The qualifying phrases in the information concerning negligence were necessary to inform appellant what proof he would have to meet because there was more than one statutory definition of negligence.

Appellant sought review and the court affirmed the conviction and held that the indictment against appellant sufficiently notified appellant of the offense, that there was no error in the trial court's refusal to submit appellant's requested charge to the jury regarding the lesser offense of unlawfully carrying a prohibited weapon, because there was no testimony at trial which raised the issue of the lesser offense, and that the trial court's jury charge was proper. The court also held that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 483 was not unconstitutionally overbroad because carrying a pistol in a warehouse, brewery or distillery was not conduct protected by the U.S. Constitution, and that collateral estoppel was not applicable to appellant's case because the jury found appellant guilty of the crimes of unlawfully carrying a pistol on a licensed premises and assault with a prohibited weapon simultaneously.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Late at night, police discovered that a restaurant's front window had been broken out. They apprehended appellant inside. At trial, appellant testified that that he had entered the restaurant through the broken window in order to telephone police. The trial court refused to give either of appellant's two requested jury instructions on criminal trespass, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.05, as a lesser included offense of burglary. The jury found him guilty of burglary with intent to commit theft, pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.02(a)(1). On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that criminal trespass under &sect; 30.05 was a lesser included offense of all three types of burglary: burglary with intent to commit a felony or theft, &sect; 30.02(a)(1); burglary by remaining concealed, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.02(a)(2); and burglary by committing or attempting to commit a felony or theft, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 30.03(a)(3). Finding that appellant's testimony raised the issue of criminal trespass, the court held that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to submit either of appellant's requested jury instructions on the lesser included offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the judgment of a trial court, Travis County (Texas), which convicted him of unlawful possession of marihuana. Appellant argued that the punishment provisions of the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15, &sect;&sect; 4.05(a) and 4.05(b)(1), were in direct conflict with the Federal Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U.S.C.S. &sect; 844(a), and therefore void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pleaded guilty and was convicted of unlawful possession of a usable quantity of marihuana of more than four ounces.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of the District Court of Harris County (Texas) that assessed his punishment at a higher term of imprisonment than the original term of sentence after a remand of his cause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of burglary and felony theft, and was sentenced to 10 years' of imprisonment. His appeal was abated because of an erroneous consideration by the trial court, for punishment purposes, of improperly admitted evidence and the cause was remanded for re-assessment of punishment by a different judge, and for resentencing. With a different judge presiding, the trial court conducted a punishment hearing, and assessed punishment at twelve years, to run concurrently with appellant's conviction for felony theft. On appeal of the sentence, the court determined that appellant could be convicted of both offenses because he committed the offense of theft after committing the offense of burglary. Although not raised by appellant, the court noted that appellant's punishment of 12 years contrasted sharply with his original sentence of 10 years and violated his constitutional right of due process. The court held that nothing in the record justified the higher punishment, and that vindictiveness toward appellant for having successfully attacked his first sentence was an error. The court abated the appeal and remanded the cause to the trial court for appropriate punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Assessment of appellant's punishment at a higher term of imprisonment than the original punishment was reversed. The court held that there was no evidence justifying the higher sentence. As such, the sentence was vindictive of appellant's successful prosecution of his appeal and it violated his right to due process. The appeal was abated and remanded for an assessment of punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for selling jewelry on a city sidewalk in violation of a city ordinance. The court affirmed the judgment finding that the ordinance cited by appellant was limited to persons who could sell merchandise from a truck or other vehicle or who rented a structure or vacant lot. The court held that the city ordinance did not authorize the sale of merchandise on city sidewalks. The court held that another city ordinance did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it exempted sellers of flowers and ice cream. The court found that neither flowers or ice cream were commodities with the same class as the articles that appellant sold, and was not so unreasonable as to strike down the law. The court found that the city had a legitimate aim in creation of classification to determine who could operate on the sidewalk, such as to limit obstruction to pedestrian traffic.</SPAN></P>

During the surveillance, appellant and an accomplice were seen taking items into the home. After an officer advised the homeowner that he could obtain a search warrant for the home, the homeowner voluntarily signed a consent to search form. The officers retrieved the property that appellant had taken into the home, which was later identified as stolen property. Appellant was arrested and convicted of burglary of a private residence at night. On review, appellant argued that the homeowner's consent to search was obtained contrary to U.S. Const. amend. IV. The appellate court expressed doubt that appellant had standing to challenge the search. Nonetheless, the appellate court found that the officer's statement that he could obtain a search warrant did not invalidate the homeowner's consent and there was no evidence that force was used to obtain the consent. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment because under the totality of the circumstances the homeowner voluntarily consented to the search and the seized evidence was admissible against appellant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the record did not contain any request for a speedy trial. The court also held that since amphetamines were listed as dangerous drugs under the applicable statutes and because art. 726d, &sect; 15 stated that penalties would be provided and increased, fair warning was given that penalties were to be included in the amendatory statute and that they would vary the former uniform penalty.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the defect of failing to allege that appellant passed the check knowing it was forged was not a fundamental defect which may be raised for the first time on appeal. The court found that a reading of the statute revealed that it unequivocally prescribed a single culpable mental state for forgery: this is the intent to defraud or harm, which is required by Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 32.21 (b). The court concluded that the legislature did not intend to include knowledge that the instrument was forged as an essential element of the offense of forgery, and that legislative intent did not provide a requirement that the state allege such knowledge in an indictment. The court found that appellant's sentence must be reformed to show that credit was given for time spent in jail after he was arrested.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the death sentence and remanded the case, holding that the cursory examination of the members of the venire who expressed opposition to the death penalty was insufficient. The court further held that Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the trial court in Harris County (Texas), for aggravated assault on a police officer. Appellant claimed error, asserting that he was denied his right to counsel on appeal, was deprived of a transcript for the purpose of appeal, was prosecuted on an insufficient and void information, improperly received a unitary trial, and received a higher punishment on retrial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In considering appellant's points of error regarding his conviction for aggravated assault on a police officer, the court concluded that since appellant was a fugitive from justice for two years, the unavailability of the court reporter's transcript was his responsibility, since the reporter could legally dispose of notes after one year. Since the notes had been thrown away long before appellant's first request for the appointment of counsel, the court found that the delay in appointing counsel produced no error. The court found appellant's contention that he was prosecuted on an insufficient and void information, since it was signed by an Assistant District Attorney rather than a Criminal District Attorney, without merit. Since appellant made no objection to a unitary trial, the court held that, in the absence of written objections to the court's charge or a showing of injury, there was no error. The court held that the rendering of a higher punishment by a jury on retrial did not violate the double jeopardy clause or offend due process as long as the jury was not informed of the prior sentence and the second punishment was not due to vindictiveness. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court was affirmed. Appellant's status as a fugitive from justice delayed proceedings so that the transcript was no longer available. Appellant's failure to object to the unitary trial or the court's charge waived any error. No vindictiveness was shown, so the higher sentence on retrial was upheld.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence for murder under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071. The court concluded that the fact that an exhaustive and precise list of factors was not specifically included did not indicate that the jury was without adequate guidelines. The court concluded that the factors which determined whether the sentence of death was an appropriate penalty in a particular case were too complex, but some factors were the likelihood that the defendant would be a continuing threat to society, whether the defendant had a significant criminal record, and the range and severity of his prior criminal conduct. The court held that the indictment was not duplicitous just because each count of the indictment charged defendant with four separate and distinct offenses: murder, attempted kidnapping, kidnapping, and forcible rape. The court concluded that defendant's arrest was legal because the record reflected that the authorities had ample evidence to detain, question, and arrest defendant when witnesses identified his truck and he had outstanding warrants for his arrest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of burglary with intent to commit theft and sentenced to life imprisonment because of enhancement by two prior convictions. Defendant petitioned for writ of habeas corpus. During the appeals process, defendant escaped from detention and his appeals were dismissed because of his escape. During defendant's period of escape, the U. S. Supreme Court decided another Texas case where appeals were dismissed when a defendant escaped from custody while the appeals process was pending and upheld the practice of dismissal of appeals when a defendant escaped from custody during the appellate process. In affirming the judgment of the lower court, the court denied the writ of habeas corpus because the decision of the U. S. Supreme Court was controlling, and defendant's appeals could be dismissed because of his escape during the appellate process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, which denied defendant's petition for writ of habeas corpus, because a U. S. Supreme Court decision adjudicated during the time of his escape from prison and the pending of his appeal allowed the dismissal of appeals by convicted defendants who escaped from custody while their appeals were pending. Thus, the decision was controlling and the dismissal of defendant's appeal was proper.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the violation holding that since no evidence was submitted to rebut the presumption created by &sect; 38-97, the proof was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The court found that appellant was the registered owner of the illegally parked car and that under &sect; 38-97, proof that an illegally parked vehicle was registered in appellant's name was prima facie evidence that appellant was guilty of a violation of &sect; 38-74. The court held that appellant failed to offer any evidence to rebut the presumption.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment from the trial court of Navarro County (Texas) that convicted and sentenced him for the offense of robbery by firearms.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for the offense of robbery by firearms. The trial court thereafter ordered an enhanced sentence for appellant under Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 64 because of a prior robbery conviction. Article 64 permitted a trial court to impose a life sentence for a defendant's second conviction where that second conviction could have authorized the imposition of the death penalty as alternative punishment. Appellant maintained that Article 64 could not be used to enhance punishment because the Supreme Court of the United States had held in an earlier case that the death penalty could no longer be imposed. The court noted that the Supreme Court did not invalidate Article 64 in the decision cited by appellant. Even though the death penalty could not be assessed after that decision, the part of Article 64 that provided for the punishment of life was not affected. Accordingly, the court affirmed the trial court judgment, holding that the trial court did not err in utilizing the &quot;alternate&quot; and remaining punishment in art. 64. The court found no reversible error in appellant's remaining points of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court judgment convicting appellant of robbery by firearms and sentencing him to life imprisonment, holding that the trial court did not err in utilizing the &quot;alternate&quot; and remaining punishment of life imprisonment, and that the enhancement of appellant's sentence based on a prior robbery conviction was not unconstitutional. The court rejected appellant's other contentions, finding no reversible error.</SPAN></P>

In the published portion of the opinion, the court addressed the contention that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art 36.29 was unconstitutional. The court affirmed appellant's conviction, holding that art. 36.29 complied with Tex.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.06, a Class C misdemeanor regarding homosexual conduct, resulting in a greater punishment. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court noted defendant was convicted of the old code offense of sodomy, and his election for punishment under the new code only made it necessary for the trial court to determine from the proof which of the applicable sections of the new code to apply. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.06 and Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 21.07 replaced the old sodomy statute. Since the proof showed that the act of deviate sexual intercourse took place in the &quot;drunk tank&quot; of the city jail, which was public place, the court did not err in assessing punishment as a Class A misdemeanor under the provisions of &sect; 21.07.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was convicted of resisting arrest by exhibiting a firearm in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 341(b). On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and held that &sect; 341(b) was not void for vagueness because it gave a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that the contemplated conduct was forbidden by the statute. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to for the jury to have found that appellant exhibited the shotgun to resist the arrest of his brother by the officers.

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 527, appellant was sentenced to a fine of $ 1,000 and confinement in jail for six months, the last four of which were probated. Appellant sought review and asserted that &sect; 527 was unconstitutionally vague to the extent that she was denied adequate notice of the prohibited conduct. The court held that it had already considered and rejected appellant's argument in another case and overruled the point of error. Appellant also contended that the trial court erred in sentencing her to two months in prison followed by four months of probation because it was an illegal sentence. The court agreed, holding that no judgment was entered where probation was granted for a misdemeanor, and that therefore the effect of the sentence imposed was that appellant would be incarcerated for two months without a judgment. The court held that where probation was granted in a misdemeanor conviction, the authority of the court was limited to a suspension of the entire term and not merely a part of it. The court reformed the sentence, probating the entire jail term, and affirmed the judgment as reformed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made an offer to sell securities to a purchaser in Texas. Defendant was not a registered securities dealer or salesperson in the state. Defendant was convicted for selling securities without having been registered in Texas and punishment was assessed by the jury at $ 5,000 fine and 5 years' confinement probated. Defendant appealed his conviction and asserted that he was not selling securities within the state because he was in Arizona when he placed the call and the delivery of the securities was to be made outside of Texas. The reviewing court held that under the Securities Act (Act), Tex. Securities Act Ann. art. 581-29(A) it was a felony for defendant to offer for sale or to deal in any manner in any security without being a registered dealer or salesperson. Defendant's offer to a potential buyer in the state qualified as an offer for sale pursuant to the Act, art. 581-4(E). Defendant's indictment gave appropriate notice of the charges against him. Extraneous offenses of security sales within the state were admissible to show defendant was &quot;dealing&quot; in stocks within the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, members of the state House of Representatives and a state employee, received a monetary gain from a stock transaction funded and orchestrated through the owner of a bank. This bank owner was seeking passage of legislation which would benefit his bank, and defendant house members brought the legislation to the floor of the house and voted in favor of the legislation. Defendants were convicted of conspiracy to accept a bribe pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 159. Evidence of transactions among the parties and the bank owner was sufficient for a reasonable jury to find defendants guilty. Refusal to quash the indictment against defendants did not violate the Speech and Debate Clause, Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 21 or U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 6, because their illegal actions were not conduct performed in an official capacity. Because evidence to which defendants objected was proven by other admissible testimony, the admission of the objected to evidence was harmless.

The court found that the amendment to &sect; 186 did not give fair notice to the legislature and the public of the drastic changes in the penalties of &sect; 186, but that defendant was not effected because he only received a fine and the amendment contained a severability clause that severed the unconstitutional portion of the amendment.</SPAN></P>

Appellants contended that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 725(b), under which they were convicted, was unconstitutional wherein it classified marihuana as a narcotic drug. They contended that when the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4476-15 was passed, it reclassified marihuana as a dangerous drug instead of a narcotic drug, and that this was an admission by the legislature that the former classification was in error. Therefore, appellants alleged that the new classification as a dangerous drug should have been retroactive and applied to their offense. The court affirmed the judgments, holding that the law in effect at the time of appellants' arrest, trial, and sentencing, concerning unlawful possession of marihuana, was &sect; 725(b), and that statute classified marihuana as a narcotic drug. The court also held that such a classification was not unconstitutional and that the question of whether an accused was entitled to probation was solely a matter for the trial court's discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction in a trial court in Randall County (Texas), for the offense of willful injury, to the extent of over $ 50.00, to personal property belonging to another. Punishment, which was assessed by the court at defendant's election, was set at 10 years' confinement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for the offense of willful injury to personal property belonging to another, a violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1350. The court held that evidence showing defendant's involvement in six other collisions, which occurred at the same location and under identical conditions as those of the collision for which he was charged, was properly admitted because intent was an essential element of &sect; 1350 and the collision for which he was charged was not an act from which guilty intent could be inferred. The trial court properly charged the jury that they could only consider the extraneous acts for their ability to prove intent. That the six other collisions were not criminal offenses and were not prosecuted did not render them inadmissible. There was sufficient evidence of the extent of the injury because the reasonable cost of repairing the damage inflicted to the property was a permissible method of proof. The court held that &sect; 1350 condemned the willful injury or destruction of personal property by whatever means accomplished. It was not necessary to first prove the violation of some other penal statute to prove a violation of &sect; 1350.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court properly admitted evidence showing defendant's involvement in six other collisions because intent was an essential element of the state's case, and such intent could not be inferred from the act itself.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the trial court (Texas), for murder with malice. Appellant was a juvenile at the time of the offense. The juvenile court had jurisdiction, held a certification hearing, and entered an order that its jurisdiction was waived and that appellant be transferred to the district court for criminal proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In considering appellant's grounds of error regarding his conviction for murder with malice, the court rejected appellant's contention that the district court lacked jurisdiction since a waiver by the juvenile court was sufficient. The court held that the trial court was under no statutory or constitutional duty to appoint a guardian ad litem, since one had been appointed for the juvenile court proceedings and the trial court appointed regular counsel. The court found that, following the oral confession, appellant took an officer to his brother's work place to get the deceased's wrist watch, which he had given to his brother, and the court concluded that the confession was admissible since it led to the finding of the watch, which was stolen property arising from the crime. The court held that the officer was not barred from testifying in the criminal court simply because he had testified in the juvenile court. The court held that appellant effectively waived his rights before confessing. The court declined to hold that appellant's young age created a fact issue for the jury on the voluntariness of the confession. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from the trial court (Texas), for murder with malice, after beating a grocery store operator in the head with an axe handle and shooting her. Appellant's death sentence was commuted to life by the governor on the recommendation of the Board of Pardons and Paroles. Appellant brought numerous points of error for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After considering appellant's grounds of error regarding his conviction for murder with malice, the court found that there was no causal connection, such as abuse, promises, violence, or duress, between the delay in proceedings and appellant's written confession. Since no witness corroborated appellant's claim of threats, the abundant evidence refuting the claim supported the holding that no threats were made. Considering the totality of the circumstances, the court held that the confession was voluntary and admissible in evidence. The court found that the prosecutor's comments on the court's charge did not specifically refer to appellant's failure to testify, nor ask the jury to consider his failure to do so against him, but rather cautioned the jury not to do so. The court held that the axe handle with appellant's fingerprint on it could be described and testified about; therefore, the fact that it had blood and hair on it would not require it to be excluded from evidence, and it was not prejudicial. The court found that the charge of insanity at the time of the offense was properly given. The judgment was affirmed as reformed from death to life.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reformed to show that the punishment was life instead of death and, as reformed, was affirmed.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was charged and convicted of passing a forged instrument. An appeals court reversed the conviction because evidence of an extraneous offense was improperly admitted where proper foundation was not laid as to its relevancy or appellant's connection with the extraneous offense. The state sought a motion for rehearing of the appeals court's judgment. On review, the court found that the state's exhibit of a forged instrument was admitted into evidence and exhibited to the jury without explanation whatsoever as to its relevancy or as to any connection with appellant. The court found the record of the prosecutor's unsworn remark showed that he was clearly inferring that appellant had passed or attempted to pass the forged instrument. The court also found it clear from what had been said that the proper predicate was not laid for the admission of the state's exhibit of the forged instrument.

It was urged that a reading of the caption of the act could not reasonably apprise the members of the legislature of the presence of &sect; 6.01(a), nor disclose any expression of purpose, which would support its presence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of indecent exposure to a person under 16 years of age and sentenced to five years imprisonment. Appellant challenged his conviction and asserted that the trial court improperly admitted evidence and testimony that denied him the right to a fair trial. On appeal the court affirmed the conviction and held that no error was shown. Rebuttal witnesses were not required to be listed on the state's witness list, and evidence of an extraneous offense was properly limited to the issue of identity. Appellant was not entitled to counsel at a pre-trial photographic display, and the photographic display was not conducted in a suggestive way so as to taint the in-court identifications. Appellant's contention that the jury was allowed to separate without his consent, as required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.23, was without any foundation in the record.

The state filed a motion to revoke probation, alleging that defendant was arrested for unlawful assembly. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the trial court's finding that he had violated the terms of his probation. The state's evidence was that during the business hours defendant and others, without permission, entered the private office occupied at that time by the assistant city manager, seated themselves at his desk, monopolized all the chairs, thereby bringing the business of that office to a halt, and, even though repeatedly requested to do so, refused to leave. The assistant city manager testified that because of the presence of defendant and his companions in his office he was unable to carry out the duties and responsibilities of his office.

Defendant challenged the constitutionality of Tex. Tax Code Ann. art. 13.17.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating Tex. Tax Code Ann. art. 13.17, &sect; 16(1), engaging in a business to operate a coin-operated music machine without a license. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute and contended that the fee was an occupation tax rather than a license fee and was hence required to be equal and uniform. Under art. 13.17, &sect; 16, a licensee who had an interest in one machine was obligated to pay the same amount as the licensee who had an interest in five machines. Also, the maximum amount of the fee imposed was $ 30,000. Therefore, a licensee with 50,000 machines paid the same fee as one who operated 300 machines. The court, assuming for purposes of the appeal that the statute imposed only a license fee, found that the graduated fee system in art. 13.17, &sect; 16, was unconstitutional and invalid. The judgment was reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed. The arbitrarily-imposed minimum and maximum fees bore no reasonable relation to the provision of comprehensive regulations of the machines in question. The court found that the legislature exceeded its power in establishing a classification system without a substantial basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of felony theft and filed a motion for a sanity examination. Defendant did not file a motion pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46.02, &sect;&sect; 1, 2. The trial court sent defendant to a mental hospital for an examination, but a jury found him to be sane at the time of the commission of the crime and at the time of the trial. After he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, defendant appealed and contended that the pre-trial sanity hearing before the trial on the merits constituted a violation of double jeopardy. The court affirmed and found that the trial court only had jurisdiction to hear pre-trial sanity motions upon the request of defendant pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46.02, &sect; 1. The court also found that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear issues regarding the defense of insanity; the court only had jurisdiction to hear competency to stand trial matters. Therefore, the court held that the procedure of the trial court was void and double jeopardy had not been violated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation sought review of convictions under the Water Code, Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 698c, &sect; 21.553, in favor of appellee State based on the contention the statute was void for indefiniteness and vagueness based upon the fact the same offense was defined under two statutes where a different penalty was provided for. The court rejected such argument, explaining the creation of a civil remedy did not render the criminal provisions indefinite. The court next rejected the argument that the allegations in the information were insufficient to charge the offense. The court explained unless an indictment deficiency was of a such a degree that it utterly failed to charge that the offense was committed by the defendant, it was objectionable only as to form and not substance. The court determined in the present case that appellant went to trial without raising any such objection and was precluded from now raising them for the first time. The court reasoned a defendant was not permitted to wait and see whether the jury would acquit and then, upon an adverse verdict, claim lack of notice of the offense charged. The court affirmed appellant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's water pollution conviction because the statute under which the conviction was obtained was not rendered indefinite and vague by the fact a civil remedy also provided penalties for the same offense and the indictment sufficiently charged the offense that any alleged deficiency was to the form and not substance of the complaint for purposes of providing adequate notice.</SPAN></P>

Defendant, in a pro se brief, challenged the constitutionality of the sodomy statute, Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 524. The trial court affirmed and held that defendant's judicial confessions were sufficient to support his convictions under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 1.15. The court held that art. 524 was constitutional and that defendant was properly convicted of three counts of sodomy because all were separate, distinct, and not proven by the same acts or evidence. The court held that the trial court was permitted to review hearsay statements, if there were any, in the pre-sentence report. The court found that, under the facts, defendant received adequate assistance of counsel at trial because the state made a motion to dismiss two other pending indictments against him in view of his guilty pleas and that appellate counsel was not inadequate because he did not raise the issue of art. 524's constitutionality on appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the offense of exhibiting obscene matter pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 527. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The United States Supreme Court granted defendant's petition for writ of certiorari, vacated the court's judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of its recent rulings. On remand, the court affirmed its original ruling and upheld defendant's conviction. The court held that even if the denial of a requested post-seizure hearing would render the seizure of defendant's film unconstitutional, defendant's failure to request a hearing barred appellant from complaining of the failure to the court to conduct one. Because the film was introduced into evidence, there was no need for expert testimony as to its obscene nature. The court held that the film was obscene as a matter of law. The court held that the term &quot;sexual matters&quot; in article 527 was not vague so as not to put defendant on notice. In overruling defendant's motion for rehearing, the court held that article 527 had been authoritatively construed by other courts so as to meet the requirement that the prohibited sexual conduct be specifically defined.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that there was no evidence to support constructive contempt, because there was no order of the court that relators violated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction from Bexar County (Texas) for possession of narcotic paraphernalia.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of narcotic paraphernalia. The court affirmed. Appellant asserted that it was error to overrule his motion to examine and for independent chemical analysis, made under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 39.14. The trial court had ruled that the police chemist's report was available to appellant and that the chemist could be cross-examined. Without passing on the issues raised by the parties on appeal, this court determined that there was not enough drug remaining for an independent chemist to make an analysis after the police chemist had conducted his tests. Further, the police chemist had conducted his tests long before appellant's motion for discovery and request for independent chemist were made. Thus, if the trial court had appointed an independent chemist, such examination would have been of no benefit. Finally, the court held that appellant's resentencing was null and void, and that the original sentence was unaffected by the action, because a portion of the Texas Controlled Substances Act was declared to be unconstitutional insofar as it applied to cases pending on appeal, such as appellant's case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following his conviction of willfully fleeing from a police officer in violation of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, &sect; 186, appellant sought review and contended that &sect; 186 was unconstitutional because the caption did not indicate that the amendment prescribed a penalty contrary to the provisions of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. The court found that the legislature had failed to follow the constitutional requirement of including the subject matter in the title and that therefore the penalty in &sect; 186 was void. However, the court noted that there was a severability clause in the bill under which the portion of the statute defining the violation remained valid and enforceable even though the penalty language was unenforceable. The court held that the general penalty provision of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, &sect; 143 was applicable. Concerning appellant's argument that &sect; 186 was unconstitutionally vague, the court disagreed, holding that the language of the statute could be interpreted according to its ordinary and usual meaning. The court reversed the judgment of conviction because the penalty imposed was not authorized by law and remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann art. 725f, based on the contention he was entitled to elect to be sentenced under the statute when his appeal was pending at the time of the statute's effective date. The court rejected relator's argument and concluded respondent state properly objected based on the fact the resulting less severe sentence would cause an unconstitutional infringement upon the clemency power granted to the executive branch under the state constitution, Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 11A. The court explained that the procedure authorized by the statute appeared to fall within the term &quot;commutation&quot; of sentence and that the substance of the effect and not the name by which it was called controlled for purposes of the analysis. The court rejected the argument that until a final conviction existed, no such infringement upon the governor's clemency power occurred. The court explained the statute's use of the &quot;after conviction&quot; language meant simply the verdict of conviction and not the sentence. The court denied relator's requested habeas corpus relief.</SPAN></P>

Appellant also claimed that article 62 was applied in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner by the state and that a mandatory life sentence was cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed, holding that the testimony of appellant's father was properly admitted because it was inconsistent with and contradictory to the alibi testimony given by the witness on direct examination. Thus, the telephone conversation was not hearsay because it was not offered for the truth of the statements of the witness, but only to impeach the father's alibi testimony.

Defendant signed a written instrument, waiving his right not to have his motel room searched without a search warrant. Though the arresting officers' warning to defendant that he had a right not to have his motel room searched without a search warrant and that he had a right to refuse to consent to the search was not required or essential, it was of evidentiary value in determining whether a valid consent was given. The court held that under the totality of the circumstances, defendant 's consent was an intelligent, knowledgeable waiver without coercion. The court held that the fact that defendant was under arrest did not, in and of itself, prevent a free and voluntary consent from being given. Even assuming that the arrest and detention were illegal, defendant's consent to search, voluntarily made, dissipated the taint of the arrest and made the fruits of the search admissible into evidence.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect; 4.06 (1973).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An inmate was convicted of possession of marijuana and sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment. On appeal his conviction was affirmed. Subsequently, he petitioned the convicting court for resentencing pursuant to the Texas Controlled Substances Act, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 4.06 (1973). Relator district attorney filed a petition for writ of prohibition to prevent the lower court judge from acting on the inmate's petition. Relator contended that the provision of the Controlled Substance Act, which granted the convicting court the authority to resentence, was violative of Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 5. The court issued the writ of prohibition. The court held that under Tex. Const. art. IV, &sect; 5, the power of power of clemency was placed in the hands of the governor, acting upon the recommendation of the board of pardons and paroles. Thus, the Texas Controlled Substance Act which granted the convicting court the power of the to resentence an individual who was convicted of a marijuana offense, extended commutation offenses, and allowed the convicting court to change a former conviction for a felony to a misdemeanor; infringed upon the governor's constitutional authority to grant clemency.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that the adjudication of insanity was a clerical error and deemed the contention to be without merit. The court held that the trial court judge assigned to the matter was qualified to preside of the matter. The court held that the arrest was lawful and there was not search to consider because appellant had abandoned the contraband. The court further held that appellant's statements testified to without objection and if inadmissible, the trial judge, as trier of fact, was presumed to have disregarded them.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued the evidence was insufficient to show that he was represented by counsel in the prior case. The court held that the judgment in the prior case recited that defendant was represented by counsel, and defendant's testimony contradicting the statement was insufficient to overcome the presumption of the regularity of the record. Thus, the court held that the prior conviction was properly used to impeach defendant's credibility. The court then held that defendant had failed to preserve for review his contention that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on how the prior conviction could be considered, as defendant had not objected to the proposed jury instruction at the trial level. Additionally, the court relied on its prior determination that Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery by assault and sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held defendant's motion to quash the jury panel was properly denied because the panel was selected from a jury wheel filled in substantial compliance with Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2094. The court found that 132,000 names were taken from the voter registration and property tax lists, 13,000 names came from county attorneys and were checked by the clerk, and there was no showing that any class of citizens was excluded or that defendant sustained any harm. The court held the trial court properly overruled defendant's objection to the enhancement portion of the indictment based on a variance between the date of the conviction alleged in the indictment and the date shown on the face of the sentence. The court held the cause number, name of defendant, court, offense, term date and day of the month were identical on the judgment and sentence and supported the allegations in the indictment, that it would have been impossible for defendant to have been sentenced seven years before the date of the judgment, and that a clerical error did not provide grounds for reversal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's denial of appellant's motion for dismissal because he had failed to show that he had made efforts to locate the witnesses he claimed were necessary and also failed to make a showing that the witnesses may have material information or be important to his defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the trial court convicted defendant of inciting a riot, defendant appealed, contending that the act under which he was prosecuted, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 466a, was unconstitutional. Defendant argued that because &sect; 466a did not define or refer to incitement to riot, other than in its title, it embraced such a broad range of possibly unlawful conduct that it could not have reasonably been considered within the scope of statutory riot, which required an unlawful assemblage of at least three persons. Thus, defendant urged that the act failed to describe its subject as was required under Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. In reversing, the court stated that, after liberally construing the language of the act's title, in an attempt to uphold the validity of the statute, it was still unable to find that the title of the act was sufficient to advise the legislature and the public as to the actual subject matter of the act. Thus, the court concluded that the act, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 466a, was violative of Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of inciting a riot because the statute under which defendant was prosecuted was unconstitutional as it failed to sufficiently describe the subject matter of the statute. Although the statute's title stated that it related to incitement to riot, it did not define or mentioned the subject of inciting riots anywhere else in the statute. The court dismissed the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was arrested for possession of marihuana, a justice court set his bond at $ 2,500, and a bail bond company became surety on defendant's bond. Defendant was later indicted and the trial court set his bond at $ 2,000, but he was allowed to remain free under the original $ 2,500 bond. Subsequently, defendant was again arrested for a different offense, and pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 17.16 the bail bond company withdrew as surety on defendant's bond. After the trial court denied defendant's petition for writ of habeas corpus and found that defendant was legally detained, defendant appealed contending that art. 17.16 was unconstitutional as violative of due process of law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it allowed the bail bondsman to withdraw ex parte as surety on the bond without any form of hearing. In affirming, the court held that art. 17.16 was not unconstitutional and that defendant was lawfully detained under a valid indictment in lieu of the $ 2,000 bail. The court noted that if the surety was wrongfully withdrawn, the appropriate remedy was in a civil action against the bonding company, not a habeas corpus proceeding.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was arrested and signed a confession that evening. Appellant contended at trial that the shooting was conducted in self defense. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court that found appellant guilty of murder with malice and assessed punishment of 20 years. The court held that it was not reversible error for the trial court to inform the jury of the punishments available when it issued instructions during the guilt or innocence phase of the trial. The court further ruled that appellant's confession was freely and voluntarily given in conformance with Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 38.22, when the officer that received the confession testified that he reviewed appellant's rights with her and she agreed that she understood them before the confession was written.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After pleading guilty, appellant was convicted of possession of narcotic paraphernalia, rape, and two charges of robbery by assault. Appellant sought review of his conviction, contending that the record was silent as to any waiver of the 10-day time for his defense attorney to prepare for trial. However, the court rejected this contention and affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court found that, under Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 26.04, the 10-day waiver rule only applied in the case of appointed counsel, but appellant had retained his own counsel. Appellant also contended that he pled guilty out of desperation and that he had wanted a jury trial. The court also rejected this contention, holding that appellant had received the proper admonition as to the consequences of his guilty plea. Finally, the court rejected appellant's contention that Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 725b, &sect; 2(c) was unconstitutional because it violated U.S. Const. amend. VIII's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The court rejected this argument, holding the statute to be constitutional. .</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment of conviction, holding that appellant's conviction after his plea of guilty was proper because the trial court properly admonished appellant of the consequences of his plea of guilty, because the 10-day counsel preparation rule did not apply to appellant's retained counsel, and because the drug paraphernalia statute under which appellant was convicted was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted appellants for the offense of possession of a narcotic drug, morphine, and assessed punishment at eight years. On appeal, appellants contended that the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions since there was no evidence of record that the drug morphine was a narcotic drug. Appellants further contended that the trial court's admonition failed to inquire of appellants whether or not appellants' pleas were uninfluenced by any persuasion, by any fear, and by any delusive hope of pardon. The court stated that Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 725b, &sect; 1(12) provided that &quot;opium&quot; includes morphine, and Article 725b, &sect; 1 (14) provided that &quot;narcotic drugs&quot; means coca leaves, opium. Appellants' guilty pleas admitted possession of morphine. Further, the court concluded that the admonishment given was sufficient compliance with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13. The court affirmed the trial court's judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sold marihuana to a police informant and an undercover officer. He was tried and convicted for sale of marihuana. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the undercover officer was not an accomplice witness as a matter of law because he did not bring about the crime, but only obtained evidence. There was no break in the chain of custody of the narcotic. The fact that the substance was not in defendant's constant sight went only to the weight and not to the admissibility of the evidence. The state's failure to record grand jury proceedings was not error, as there was no requirement to do so. That there were three counts in the indictment but only one offense was not error, as Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 21.24 allows such charging. The classification of marihuana with hard drugs such as heroin was not an unconstitutionally unreasonable and arbitrary classification. There was no systematic exclusion of persons under 21 years old from grand jury duty, because when the grand jury handed down the indictment, 18-21 year old persons were not eligible to vote in state elections, hence not eligible to serve on the grand jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of a district court of Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of murder. He argued that his confession was involuntary and should not have been admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder. He argued that the confession on which his conviction was based was not voluntary because he had been beaten by the police. He also argued that the trial court erred in not limiting to the peremptory category challenges to prospective jurors who had scruples about the imposition of the death penalty. Appellant was arrested in one county for a theft offense and transported to another where he was warned by a magistrate on the murder charge. He was also given a Miranda warning by police before his interrogation, which lasted from 10 p.m. until about 2 a.m. He ate a sandwich at 9 p.m. and was given bathroom breaks. He did not ask for an attorney. He gave a written confession, slept through the night, and the next morning, reread, corrected, and signed his confession, which contained voluntariness warnings. Police denied that they beat appellant, and two witnesses who spoke with appellant after his confession offered his statements to contradict this theory. The court upheld the trial judge's finding that the confession was voluntary and affirmed the conviction. Appellant's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for murder and held that his confession was voluntary. In a separate hearing on voluntariness, evidence that appellant was properly given Miranda warnings, that he was not deprived of food or drink, that he was reasonably rested, and that after a night's sleep he signed the confession he had written the previous night, all supported the trial judge's finding that appellant's confession was voluntary.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was subsequently arrested and convicted for the sale of a narcotic drug and received a 23-year sentence. Defendant appealed from his conviction alleging two grounds of error. Defendant claimed that art. 725b, V.A.P.C., was unconstitutional because it classified marihuana as a narcotic and that the court improperly overruled an objection to the jury charge that stated it was unlawful to &quot;manufacture, possess, sell, prescribe, administer, dispense, or compound&quot; any narcotic drugs. The court affirmed the judgment and held that classification of marihuana as a narcotic was not unconstitutional. The court also held that defendant was not injured by the jury charge because the charge included additional language that restricted defendant's guilt to the jury belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the sale occurred.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's decision because the fact that the demanding state's affidavit was based on information and belief did not render the affidavit defective or defeat extradition. The court also rejected defendant's contention that he was not a fugitive of Nevada, because he was not in Nevada on the day charged in the affidavit, on the grounds that the Uniform Criminal Extradition act, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 53.13 provided for the extradition of a person who was charged in the demanding state with committing an act in Texas, intentionally resulting in a crime of the demanding state, and that neither U.S. Const. art.

Appellant contended that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction in that the state had failed to prove that the premises in question were licensed under the provisions of the act. The court affirmed. The owner of the premises had testified that his establishment was licensed. Also, evidence of appellant shooting a patron was sufficient. The prior convictions, used to enhance the punishment, were alleged by appellant to have required admonishments that they could be used to enhance a future conviction and sentencing. No such requirement existed. Appellant failed to request any special jury instructions, and any appellate argument was, therefore, waived.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered a plea of nolo contendere to the offense of establishing a lottery and was assessed a fine under the terms of Tex.

Section 654(3) was specifically amended to exempt games established for the benefit of nonprofit charitable institutions. The court held that Section 654(3) as amended in 1971 was unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 47 because article III, &sect; 47 required the legislature to pass laws against the establishment of lotteries in all forms.

Defendant's appointed counsel, the same for both the trial and the appeal, requested that defendant be given time to review the record and submit a pro se brief, which defendant never did. Defendant contended that the enhancement portions of the indictments were oppressive and coercive and thus unconstitutional. Defendant's counsel filed a brief reciting that the appeal was frivolous. On appeal, the court agreed and affirmed the convictions because the United States Supreme Court had held that Texas recidivist statutes were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant and several other individuals were sitting in a commons area of a college university and began making remarks about desecrating the flag.

Appellant was convicted of insult to the flag of the United States under Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 152. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court finding no reversible error. The court found that art. 152 was not unconstitutional. The facts showed acts that constituted the type of hard core conduct that would have been prohibited under any construction that the court might have given the statute. The trial court did not err in failing to grant appellant's motion in limine to restrain the state from mentioning any of the acts engaged in by the other individuals at the time in question because the acts complained of were admissible as res gestae of the offense. The court also found no error in the jury charge given and no error in the trial court's refusal to submit to the jury appellant's requested charge defining &quot;flag.&quot;</SPAN></P>

It rejected appellant's arguments that the statute was vague and overbroad, both on its face and as applied to him, in violation of his rights under U.S. Const. amend. I and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court conceded that &sect; 152 insofar as it prohibited acts done in private and communication by words was undoubtedly in violation of amend. I. However, the court found that by enforcing the statute as if acts done in private and communication by words had been omitted, &sect; 152 was a valid statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought review of the order of the District Court Hunt County (Texas), which denied petitioner's writ of habeas corpus in the state's revocation of petitioner's probation action, pursuant to Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, a 17-year-old male, had received probation after he had entered a plea of guilty to an indictment, which charged him with the offense of malicious mischief for destroying the property of another. However, the state filed a motion to revoke petitioner's probation. Petitioner filed an application for writ of habeas corpus, which was denied. Petitioner contended that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2238-1 and Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 30, &sect; 2 treated males and females unequally under the law and was violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed the order of the trial court and held that the 17 and 18-year-old classification was unconstitutional and, therefore, severed that portion of the statute. Thus, by deleting the 17 and 18-year-old classification, every person was amenable to punishment for offenses under Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 29, except persons under the age of 15. Therefore, petitioner was amendable to prosecution for an offense under the Penal Code committed when he was 17 years of age.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the cause to determine whether appellant is indigent holding, in line with the U.S. Supreme Court that the distinction between felony and nonfelony offenses were unreasoned the state must afford a indigent defendant a record of sufficient completeness to permit proper consideration of his claims on appeal but need not necessarily furnish a complete verbatim transcript, but may provide alternatives that accord effective appellate review.

Subsequently, the governor of Texas, acting upon the recommendation of the state board of pardons and paroles, granted each appellant a commutation of sentence from death to life imprisonment. Appellants sought review of the commutations, contending that because the United States Supreme Court had vacated the judgments, there existed no procedure to validly sentence them, and therefore they should be granted a new trial, resentenced by a jury, or released from custody. The court affirmed the commutations, rejecting out-of-state authority that appellants were entitled to have a jury assess their punishment.

The court held the trial judge was not required to transfer the second contempt citation to another judge because when defendant took the witness stand and refused to answer the court-ordered question, he lost his status as an officer of the court and became a witness subject to a finding of direct contempt. The court held the amendment to art. 1911a did not alter the judge's power to punish defendant, that the retired judge who conducted the contempt hearing was qualified within Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6228b, &sect; 7, and that each of defendant's claims regarding the constitutionality of Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 1911a were without merit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of contempt against defendant which were based on defendant fraudulently obtaining a default judgment in a divorce proceeding and in refusing to answer a court-ordered question at the hearing on the contempt citation because there was sufficient evidence to support the judgments, correct procedures were followed, and the statute withstood all of defendant's claims that it was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of his conviction for murder with punishment of death. On appeal the court reformed the judgment and affirmed the conviction. The court held the evidence of fingerprints was sufficient to support the conviction where a police officer stationed at a convenience store was shot during the robbery of the store. The court held fingerprints alone could be sufficient to convict if the evidence showed they were made at the time of the burglary. Defendant's fingerprints were lifted from the packages of meat handled by the robber at the scene and from the gun which fired the fatal shot, and there was evidence that defendant was in the car in which the death weapon was found after the shooting. The court held this evidence negated the claim that defendant might have placed his fingerprints on the packages prior to the crime. The court reformed the sentence of death to life imprisonment pursuant to a proclamation of the Texas governor that commuted the punishment and held that a ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court regarding jurors in death penalty cases was not applicable because punishment was assessed at life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's conviction of appellant for aggravated assault upon a police officer. The court held that appellant waived his right to challenge the trial court's jurisdiction because he failed to file a formal plea. Even if appellant's motion to quash constituted such a plea, the trial court proceedings were not void under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 4.16 because the courts had concurrent jurisdiction; and, although the indictments arose from the same incident, they alleged different criminal offenses. Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;1160a was not unconstitutionally vague because the statute created only a single offense with a single range of penalty regardless of whether the offense was committed with or without malice. It was not necessary to allege malice aforethought in the indictment because it was not an essential element of a &sect; 1160a offense. Sufficient evidence existed to sustain the conviction for aggravated assault upon a police officer. Appellant failed to file a sworn motion requesting the probation and failed to offer any evidence that he was entitled to probation as mandated by Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the order of the trial court of Potter County (Texas), revoking his probation, contending that the state did not prove that the stolen motorcycle was valued at over $ 50, that his accomplice's testimony was insufficient, and that Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to five years' imprisonment, probated. Subsequently, the state moved to revoke his probation alleging that he stole a motorcycle valued over $ 50. On review, appellant contended that the evidence did not establish that the value of the motorcycle was over $ 50. He also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence to support the revocation of probation because it was based on his accomplice's testimony. Finally, he alleged that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, the Adult Probation statute, was unconstitutional because it did not permit trial by jury or provide for bail pending revocation. The court affirmed finding that at a revocation of probation proceeding, it was not necessary to prove that the value of a stolen item was over $ 50. The fact that it had some value and that it was taken by the probationer in violation of a condition of his probation controlled. Next, the court held the testimony of an accomplice was sufficient to authorize the trial court to revoke probation. Finally, the court noted that appellant did not request a trial by jury or bail pending revocation; therefore, he could not complain on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner convicted criminal filed a post-conviction application with the court for writ of habeas corpus. Petitioner claimed that he was entitled to credit for spent in a state mental hospital after he was initially found incompetent to stand trial, and before his sanity was restored and he was tried. He also claimed that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46.02 was unconstitutional if it denied credit, and that he received ineffective counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When petitioner convicted criminal was first arrested, he was found incompetent to stand trial and was committed to a state hospital. Six years later, following restoration of his sanity, petitioner was tried on the indictment. He did not plead insanity at the time the crime was committed. Petitioner was convicted, sentence was imposed, petitioner appealed, and the conviction was affirmed. Petitioner thereupon filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus. The petition for habeas corpus was denied. Under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 46.02, the trial court had discretion to credit a convicted defendant with time spent confined in a mental hospital prior to trial. There was no federal constitutional right to credit for time served prior to sentence, except where the sentence followed a retrial and second conviction for same offense for which the individual was previously tried, convicted, and sentenced. The trial court's decision not to give petitioner credit was not an abuse of discretion. The decision of petitioner's trial counsel not to plead insanity at the time of the offense was a matter of deliberate trial strategy, and was not ineffective representation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition for habeas corpus was denied. The statute gave the sentencing court discretion to deny credit for pre-trial incarceration in a mental institution after a determination of incompetency, and was not unconstitutional. The failure of defendant's counsel to challenge his sanity at the time of the offense was a matter of trial strategy, not ineffective representation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate was convicted of possession of a narcotic drug, dolophine, and his punishment was assessed at life imprisonment as a result of allegations and proof of two prior felony convictions. Petitioner instituted federal habeas corpus proceedings, contending that a federal conviction for acquiring marihuana without having paid the federal Marihuana Transfer Tax was invalidly applied retroactively to enhance the sentence he was currently serving. The court held that petitioner could challenge his sentence imposed under the habitual criminal statute to the extent that it was enhanced by an unconstitutional or void prior conviction, and issued the writ of habeas corpus. The court reasoned that to allow one to continue to be penalized for conduct that was constitutionally immune from punishment would contravene basic concepts of justice and fairness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were refused bail in a habeas corpus proceeding by the trial court after they were indicted for murder with malice subsequent to a United States Supreme Court opinion that held that the death penalty as currently imposed in the United States constituted cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the U.S. Const. amends. VIII, XIV. Tex. Const. art. I, &sect;11 and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. art. 1.07 both provided that all prisoners were bailable unless for capital offenses when the proof was evident. And, a capital offense was defined in Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 47 as an offense for which the highest penalty was death. Thus, the court held that in light of the United States Supreme court decision, defendants were improperly refused bail because the death penalty was no longer a possibility for their offense of murder with malice. The decision ended the existence of a capital offense as defined in art. 47 and precluded the state from proving that a capital offense was evident under art. I, &sect;11 and art. 1.07. Thus, there was no case in which bail could be denied under art. I, &sect;11 and art. 1.07, including defendants. As such, the order denying bail was reversed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An officer and a police photographer went to a theater, paid the admission price, and saw two films. The photographer took pictures of certain frames. Thereafter, the officer completed an &quot;Obscene Film Offense Report&quot; that included a physical description of employees seen in the theater at the time the film was shown. Based on an affidavit by the officer, the &quot;Obscene Film Offense Report,&quot; and the pictures, a finding of probable cause was made and an arrest warrant for appellant was issued. Appellant was convicted for exhibiting an obscene film in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 527 (1972). The court reversed, remanded, and held that the evidence was insufficient to sustain an obscenity conviction unless the film was introduced into evidence or appellant expressly and affirmatively stipulated or admitted that the material was obscene under the standards stated in Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 527 &sect; 1(A). The court further held that mere fact, however, that appellant stipulated as to obscenity did not preclude the state from introducing the film. The court found that the stipulation only served to remove from the state the burden of putting the film into evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of a trial court in Hidalgo County, Texas, that convicted him of murder after he pled guilty. His claim of error related only to the issue of punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contended that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to present prejudicial testimony to the jury for punishment enhancement and impeachment purposes. The prosecutor questioned appellant on cross-examination about misdemeanor convictions he had received. Because he never objected to the line of questioning, the court held appellant preserved nothing for appellate review and affirmed the conviction of appellant. The court found that after appellant testified that he could not recall the convictions he was questioned about and the state did not pursue the matter. The court held that there was no showing that the prosecutor acted in bad faith. Because appellant testified as to his exemplary conduct, the state could have refuted the testimony with the convictions, but chose not to fully address that issue because appellant preserved nothing for review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment that convicted appellant of murder and found the punishment enhancements proper because appellant preserved no error for appellate review and could not complain about the admission of misdemeanor convictions for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for robbery by firearms, alleging that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 19.34, 35.02, and 35.22 were unconstitutional because they required members of grand and petit juries to express a belief in God. The court held that the statutory provisions permitted both juries and witnesses to affirm rather than swear and that there was no requirement to express a belief in God. Therefore, the statutes did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I, U.S. Const. amend. XIV, or Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 5. The court held that appellant failed to preserve error on several points, including the display of a handgun to the jury and state's closing argument. The court held that the indictment was adequate because it did not need to allege that appellant and his codefendant acted together. The court held that while the judgment erroneously stated that appellant had pleaded guilty, it was an error that could be reformed on appeal to reflect that he pleaded not guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction of robbery by firearms because the statutory provisions requiring a juror's oath were not unconstitutional as they did not require expression of belief in the existence of God. Appellant waived any error as to the display of a handgun to the jury, the reading of the indictment to the jury, or state's closing argument because he failed to object at trial.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. &sect;1147(9), alleging that the disparate treatment of male and female offenders under the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that one of the objectives of Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1147 was the prevention of the type of assault likely to cause serious bodily injury by greater punishment of that type of assault. The court held that because women generally were smaller in size and had less strength than men, an assault by a man upon a woman was more likely to cause serious injury than an assault on a woman by another woman. Therefore, the disparate treatment of offenders had a rational basis to the objective of the statute and did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that neither admonition of the consequences of a guilty plea nor evidence of guilt was required for a misdemeanor. The court held that the trial court did not err by not informing appellant of his right to file an application for probation because it was a procedural matter and not a consequence of the plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of the misdemeanor offense of equipping a gaming house, contended on review that the evidence was insufficient, that Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 629 was overly broad and unconstitutional, that the search warrant did not set out the hour of issuance as required by law and did not include a sufficient description of the premises, and that certain pictures were irrelevant and immaterial. The state challenged the appeal as moot, contending defendant's period of probation expired before the appellate court had jurisdiction and he had no standing to appeal. The court held that if the state's contention was upheld it would have denied defendant the right that his probation did not begin until the judgment of the appellate court was final. The court found the evidence sufficient for the trier of fact to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the premises were in fact being used for gaming and that defendant aided in equipping it for that purpose. The court also found that the vagueness and overbreadth doctrines were inapplicable. The court held that there was no reversible error as to defendant's other contentions.

Upon learning that appellant was unemployed, the officers arrested him for vagrancy, conducted a search incident to arrest, and found a knife. Appellant was charged with unlawfully carrying a switchblade knife. The court held that the vagrancy statute, Tex. Pen. Code Ann. art. 607 &sect;&sect; 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, and 12, was unconstitutionally vague because it made the status of poverty a crime without qualification, thus leaving the court to determine who would be punished. The court noted that no standard was given to guide officers as to what was meant by a person who &quot;has no visible means of support&quot; or &quot;no property to support him.&quot; Because appellant's arrest was invalid, the court found that it was error for the trial court to overrule his motion to suppress the fruits of the subsequent search.

The court overruled appellant's contention that the information failed to allege the commission of a criminal offense because the language stating that she solicited a customer &quot;to buy her a drink&quot; showed that she did unlawfully solicit a customer to buy a drink &quot;for her consumption.&quot; The court held that a reading of the relevant statutes revealed that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 667-19B(e) was a penal, not civil, statute. Appellant's contention that the statute was unconstitutionally vague was rejected because the word &quot;solicitation&quot; was a word of common usage and its meaning was simple and not subject to any particular usage. The statute did not prohibit a waitress from soliciting a person to buy drinks for any person other than the retailer or his employees. The court held that the statute applied to a holder of a wine and beer retailer's permit or his or her employees. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The court overruled appellant's complaint as to the alleged illegality of the search because the jury accepted the state's theory of the case. The court found no error in the state's inquiry as to a witness' prior conviction which was set aside because the trial court instructed the jury to disregard the testimony. No error was found in the state's cross-examination of appellant as to her prior conviction for prostitution because it was admissible for impeachment purposes once she placed her reputation for truth and veracity in issue by testifying on the merits of the case.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the lower court's conviction based on failure to quash the jury panel because the jury wheel excluded persons between 18 and 21 years of age and non-registered voters. The court affirmed the conviction and held that U.S. Const. amend. XXVI did not confer upon citizens 18 years or older the right to vote but simply prohibited discrimination against them on account of age. The court held that the states still retained the right to determine the qualifications of the jurors to serve in their own courts and could place the burden of such public duty on certain age groups, even providing exemption, though not disqualification, on account of age. Thus, 18-year-olds were not qualified jurors under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2133(1) and Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 2094, which were construed together. The court held that there was no evidence that the voter registration lists used in filling the jury wheel did not reflect a cross section of the population of the county and thus the use of the voter registration lists as the sole source for prospective jurors did not deprive appellant of due process and equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner was convicted and sentenced for the offense of robbery in 1961 that he claimed he never committed. The conviction was affirmed on appeal. Appellant later petitioned the trial court for a writ of habeas corpus to overturn the conviction, alleging that he was denied the right to call a co-principal of the offense to reveal the identity of the second robber. The trial court denied the petition and the judgment of the trial court was affirmed on appeal. On its own application, the court reconsidered its denial of appellant's petition upon the declaration that Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 82 and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 711 were unconstitutional. The court again denied appellant's petition. The court held that appellant's conviction was not affected by the declaration that &sect; 82 and article 711 were unconstitutional because appellant, neither during nor after the trial, attempted to call the co-principal as a witness, requested to have the co-principal appear at trial, attempted to obtain an affidavit from the co-principal, or requested that the co-principal identify the alleged second robber.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for robbery and sentenced to life imprisonment. A prior conviction had been alleged in the indictment for enhancement purposes. Defendant appealed and contended that Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 62 was unconstitutional, the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict and to show that the money taken was the corporeal personal property of the victim, and evidence of a prior conviction was improperly certified. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction because the constitutional right to trial by jury did not encompass the right to have the jury assess punishment and that art. 62 did not authorize cruel and unusual punishment. The court found that defendant's action in placing his hand in his pocket and the bulge in the sweater, coupled with his command to fill the sack with money was sufficient to constitute an assault, which as one element of robbery, supported the verdict, and that it was sufficient that the victim had actual control, care and management of the property. Further, the court found that evidence of a prior conviction where the fingerprints were identical to defendant's was proper proof of the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in sentencing him in accordance with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 725b, &sect; 23(1) (1969) because his prior offense occurred before the effective date of a 1955 amendment. He claimed that his sentence as a second offender was invalid because the enhancement was an ex post facto law and unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession of marijuana as a second offender. The court held that an amendment to a statute which provided for increased penalties upon a second conviction did not increase the punishment for the offense, thus, it was not an ex post facto law. In so holding, the court overruled the dictum in Hill v. State, 256 S.W.2d 93 (1953). The court found that the trial court corrected an error with respect to the amount of years of confinement. However, defendant pled to the charge stating that he would not change it due to the correction. On appeal, the court corrected and reformed the judgment at the request of the prosecution because the stipulations reflected a second offense.</SPAN></P>

The failure to allege that the victim of the theft was a corporation was not reversible error.

Appellant contended that the provisions of the statute, as applied to the facts of the case, were unconstitutional as an ex post facto law. The court found the contention was without merit. A conviction which occurred prior to the enactment of a statute providing for increased punishment on a subsequent conviction was not unconstitutional as an ex post facto law. The court also found that fair notice of the penalties were included in the title of the act. On appellant's claim that his two prior convictions were wrongfully used because the state failed to show that appellant had counsel in those cases, the court found that appellant raised the issue for the first time on appeal and failed to show that he was in fact without counsel.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment by a trial court in Bexar County (Texas), which convicted defendant of robbery by assault and assessed punishment at 15 years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty and was convicted of robbery by assault. The trial court assessed punishment at 15 years. Defendant argued for the first time on appeal that the grand jury, which indicted him, was illegally constituted, as it was selected by grand jury commissioners under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 19.01, which required that the commissioners be qualified jurors and freeholders in the county. Defendant alleged that this would keep poor people from serving as commissioners and thus was unconstitutional. On review, the court found no reversible error and affirmed the conviction. The court held that defendant was not permitted to raise this issue for the first time on appeal, and furthermore, that the issue had already been decided, that the statute was capable of being carried out without discrimination. The court also concluded that the record did not support defendant's pro se statement of facts regarding arrest and conviction, where he made allegations of inadequate representation of counsel and denial of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting defendant of robbery by assault. The court held that defendant could not complain for the first time on appeal that the grand jury which indicted him was illegally constituted, and reiterated that the statute, which required that grand jury commissioners be qualified jurors and freeholders in the county, could be carried out without discrimination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for the possession of marihuana. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting evidence obtained by search warrant. The affidavit supporting the search warrant satisfied the requirements of Aguilar: the informant was credible, had been a reliable source in the past, and gave detailed information regarding his assertion of where narcotics could be located. The affidavit also contained non-hearsay information that was within the affiant's personal knowledge. The court found no error in the entry into defendant's house to conduct the search. Although officers initially brought the wrong warrant into the house, they quickly retrieved the correct warrant and no search was conducted until the proper warrant was presented. Expert testimony established that sufficient marihuana was seized to support a finding that defendant was in possession of marihuana. The court held that there was no error and the trial court did not coerce a verdict when it sent the jury back for further deliberations. Only one of the panel of jurors felt that a verdict could not be reached.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was arrested in another state, waived extradition proceedings, and was returned to the state.

During the punishment phase, two witnesses testified as to appellant's bad reputation. Subsequently, appellant was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Appellant then sought review, raising numerous contentions. On review, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence because appellant was represented by counsel at the critical stages of the proceedings, appellant had adequate representation, appellant did not demonstrate the evidence offered against him had been tampered with, and the sentence was within the range provided by Tex.

Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence contending that his prosecution had violated his right to free speech under U.S. Const. amend. I, that the statute was vague and overbroad, and that his sentence was cruel and unusual punishment. The court affirmed and held that based on the record, defendant's action could not be construed as speech or a communication of an idea that would trigger protection by the First Amendment. The court determined that the state could validly regulate conduct to preserve public order and preserve the flag as a national symbol. The court refused a vagueness analysis because defendant's action had been validly regulated and determined that his punishment was not cruel or unusual because it had comported with the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged denial of his habeas corpus application from Travis County (Texas), contending that the trial court erred in finding that there was a valid law in effect under which he had been charged for possession of a dangerous drug, to-wit: lysergic diethylamide acid (LSD), and that he was restrained of his freedom unconstitutionally in that there was no valid statute prohibiting possession of LSD under which he could be prosecuted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possession of LSD, and prior to trial, filed an application for habeas corpus, contending that the statute under which he had been charged was not valid, and, therefore, his restraint of freedom was unconstitutional. Defendant based his application on conflicting portions of a statute recently enacted, which he claimed were void and indefinite as to be inoperative. The trial court denied his application. On appeal, the court held that in construing a statute, where there was a conflict, and the statute was enacted during one session of the legislature, absent a formal express repeal, any conflict was to be resolved by the later of the two statutes. Because the statute under which defendant was restrained had amended the earlier statute to include offers to sell or deliver dangerous drugs, there was no irreconcilable conflict between the statutes, and the court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's application for habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's denial of defendant's application for habeas corpus, holding that the statutory scheme prohibiting sale or delivery or the offer to sell or deliver dangerous drugs and felony punishments for first time possession were not in conflict, and not invalid, and, therefore, defendant's restraint of freedom was not a violation of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, who was serving a sentence for a robbery conviction, sought habeas corpus relief. The issue before the court was the retroactivity of case law from the Supreme Court, in its decision that the U.S. Const. amend. VI right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses was applicable to the states through U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Petitioner had sought to have his co-principal testify in his behalf. The trial court refused. If petitioner were to be denied relief, it would have had to have been on the basis that this case law should not have been applied retroactively. The court reversed, and set aside petitioner's conviction. The right of an accused to have compulsory process for obtaining a witness in his favor as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI, included the right to use a physically and mentally capable witness whose testimony was material and relevant to the defense. This was so fundamental and essential to a fair trial that it stood on a par with those cases, which had been given full retroactive application by the United States Supreme Court. In light of the fact that petitioner was deprived of such testimony, the error was not harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. This was an appeal from a conviction of robbery by assault. Punishment was assessed at 1,000 years. Appellant argued that the punishment was cruel and unusual because of its excessive nature. The court found that if the punishment was within that prescribed by the statute it was beyond the province of the court to pass upon the question of excessive punishment. In view of the fact that the legislature provided no maximum punishment, it was suggested that a jury could give a sentence of 25,000 or 1,000,000 years if they chose to do so. It was further suggested that 1,000 years or a million years was an impossible punishment and should not be assessed. The court concluded that since the sentences served no purpose, the legislature should set a maximum as well as a minimum for every crime. The entire sentencing structure of the state should be inquired into by the legislature, which was the proper body, and not the court, to make the corrections.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that there was no error in the jury selection because no venireman was excused unless it was made abundantly clear that under no circumstances would such prospective juror vote to inflict the death penalty in any case regardless of the facts that might be presented. Appellant's challenge to the constitutionality of arts. 1.13-1.15 was found to be without merit because the statutes prevented waiver of a jury trial in death penalty cases. The court also held that there was no evidence indicating that appellant's confession was other than completely voluntary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal appellant challenged his convictions on two counts of sodomy in Dallas County, Texas, and alleged that the trial judge conducted his trial without a proper appointment and that the evidence admitted against him was obtained in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In two separate cases, criminal appellant was found to have committed sodomy in two public restrooms. He appealed his convictions on the grounds that the trial judge was not properly appointed and because the evidence admitted against him was obtained in violation of U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court held that the trial judge as a retired judge having properly filed his election to continue to serve as a judicial officer was a district judge in this sense and no formal order needed to have been entered at the time of trial for him to preside over the case. The court further held that appellant had a right to expect privacy in a toilet stall which had a door that locked from the inside but had no such expectation of privacy in the other restroom where no doors were provided for the stalls.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction in the instance where he was observed committing sodomy in a toilet stall that had no door but reversed and remanded his conviction where he was observed in a stall which had a door which locked from the inside on the basis that his privacy was invaded in the second instance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted twice for the sale of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and punishment assessed at four years in each case to run concurrently. He challenged the convictions on the ground that H. B. No. 142, Chapter 437, Acts of 61st Legislature, Regular Session, 1969, the Dangerous Drug statute was unconstitutional under Tex. Const. art. 3, &sect; 35. The court affirmed the judgment finding that there was no error in the trial court's overruling appellant's motion to quash the indictment on the ground that the Dangerous Drug statute was unconstitutional. The court held that the caption to the bill provided fair notice of the change in the criminal code and that Vernon's Statutes was not the official publication of Texas statutes. The reference to civil statute was surplusage and not misleading or a denial of fair warning. The court held that H. B. No. 142, Chapter 437, &sect; 15(b), Acts of 61st Legislature, Regular Session, 1969 was not vague and indefinite because the word, years, did not follow the phrase, not less than two nor more than 10 years because it was clear it meant two years.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and held that once the jury had reached a decision, it was within the discretion of the trial court to allow the jury to separate until the charge on punishment was submitted to them and that appellant did not show that he was injured by the court's action. The court held that looking into appellant's window through a two-inch gap in draperies did not constitute an unconstitutional search, as he could not reasonably assume that he was free from uninvited inspection through the window. The court held that the search was made subsequent to the issuance of the warrant which was not insufficient because it did not contain the statement that the magistrate found probable cause or that it designated Bettina Street when the actual location was Bettina Court as there was no showing that there were two streets named Bettina in Houston. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of the decision of the trial court for McLennan County (Texas), which convicted him of murder with malice and punished him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder with malice and sentenced to death. The court affirmed and held that appellant was not prejudiced by the trial court's failure to state the burden in the charge on accident because immediately after that charge, the trial court gave the general charge on the burden of proof. The court also held that the victim's mother was not an accessory because although she was the only witness to testify to violence committed by appellant upon the victim, she and her child lived with appellant, and they were completely dominated by him, thus, her failure to make a report of his brutalizing the child did not make her an accessory. The court held that a form which provided for the assessment of life imprisonment should have been submitted, the jury could have used the form providing for a term of years in order to assess a life sentence, thus, because no objection was interposed, it was not reversible error. Finally, the court overruled appellant's point of error which alleged juror misconduct and held that the juror affidavits had been obtained through chicanery and were, therefore, involuntary and inadmissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of conviction for speeding entered by a trial court of Colorado County (Texas). Defendant claimed the state failed to prove that his speed was unreasonable and imprudent and that statute under which he was charged, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, &sect; 166(a), was unconstitutionally vague. Defendant also asserted the existence of numerous evidentiary errors on the part of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was clocked by highway patrol radar at a speed of 81 miles an hour on an interstate highway and was convicted of the offense of speeding. He sought review of the judgment of conviction, which was affirmed. Defendant maintained that the state failed to establish that his speed was unreasonable and imprudent. The court noted that any speed in excess of the limits established by the statute under which defendant was convicted, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6701d, &sect; 166(a), was prima facie evidence of unreasonableness. Defendant's contention that &sect; 166 was unconstitutionally vague because it used the words &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;prudent&quot; was rejected by the court as well. The highway patrolman who issued the speeding citation made a proper in-court identification of defendant. The court also found that the patrolman's radar was properly calibrated and testimony to that effect was properly admitted at trial. The court also found that there was no requirement that the complaint against defendant be attested to by seal. Finally, defendant's failure to properly specify his objection to the introduction of an exhibit in his appeal resulted in the waiver of that matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of conviction. The court held that the statute under which defendant was convicted of speeding was not unconstitutionally vague because it used the words &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;prudent,&quot; and any speed in excess of the limits established by it was prima facie evidence of unreasonableness.

Appellant was found in possession of recently stolen property and no consent of the owner was shown. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. The court found that the difference in spelling appellant's name in the indictment was not error because the names were idem sonans as there was no difference in the sound when pronounced. The court also held that appellant constitutional rights were not violated when tried because the offenses of murder without malice and of theft were separate and distinct offenses and the same evidence would not sustain a conviction for both. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in entering the order that the sentence was cumulative of the previous five year sentence because cumulative sentences have been held valid since 1881 and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.08, did not deprive appellant of his constitutional right of due process.</SPAN></P>

The trial court subtracted the time and ordered criminal released. The court denied relator district attorney's application for writ of prohibition but entered a writ of mandamus and directed respondent to set aside the portion of his order granting criminal good time under Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the District Court, Travis County, Texas, which convicted defendant of willfully injuring property of another over the value of $ 50, and which sentenced defendant to two years in prison. Defendant contended that the statute under which he was convicted, Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1350, was unconstitutional, in that it was too vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for willfully injuring property of another over the value of $ 50. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1350, which prescribed possible punishments in relation to a measure of value of property destroyed, was not unconstitutional because the statute was not so vague that men of common intelligence had to necessarily guess at its meaning and differed as to its application. The indictment was not fatally defective where it failed to allege the manner and means by which the property in question was damaged because such an allegation was unnecessary. The court found that the testimony at trial provided sufficient evidence for the jury to find the extent of the injury to the property to be over $ 50. The court found that the testimony of a used car dealer and salesman, as to the value of the car before and after such an injury was inflicted upon a hypothetical vehicle very similar to the one in question in defendant's case, was properly admitted because an expert need not personally have observed the property in question, where value could be proven by hearsay.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of rape and under a life sentence, filed an application for writ of habeas corpus and sought to challenge the constitutionality of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 42.12, &sect; 15(a) (1967) as it applied to his eligibility for parole under a life sentence imposed in 1961. The court granted defendant's application, holding that retroactive application of art. 42.12, &sect; 15(a), enacted in 1967, to defendant's parole eligibility was an unconstitutional ex post facto law and violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, cl. 3, &sect; 10 and Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 16. The court held that applying art. 42.12, &sect; 15(a) to defendant would authorize his eligibility for parole upon his life sentence following the cumulation of credit for 20 years, whereas applying the statute in effect at the time of defendant's conviction, Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 781d, &sect; 15 (1925) (repealed), would require only 15 years cumulation of credit. The court held that any law was an ex post facto law if it inflicted a greater punishment than the law annexed to the crime when committed, or if it altered the situation of the accused to his disadvantage.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's punishment was enhanced under the provisions of Article 62, V.A.P.C. The court affirmed defendant's conviction.

The court also found that the subject of the unresponsive answer was not further pursued by the state and defendant made no request for a jury instruction or mistrial. The court held that the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury to return a verdict of acquittal when the state's witnesses contradicted each other because the jury may believe a witness even though he has been contradicted. The court held that the fact that the state failed to call rebuttal witnesses after defendant's alibi witnesses testified did not mean that the alibi testimony must be taken as undisputed. The court held that Article 62 was constitutional and its use in the case at bar did not result in a violation of the double jeopardy provisions of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed that because he was in the custody of the Texas Youth Council at the time of the offense, the district court did not have jurisdiction, and that art. 524 (1943) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, age 18, committed sodomy on a fellow male student at his school. As a result, appellant was convicted of sodomy under Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 524 (1943) after he pled nolo contendere to the charge. On appeal, the court held that because appellant was an 18-year-old male and because sodomy was a felony, the district court had jurisdiction to try his case although appellant had previously been adjudged a juvenile delinquent who was committed to the Texas Youth Council and jurisdiction had not been waived by the juvenile court. The court held that because the successful prosecution of a truly private consensual acts of sodomy was at most only conceivable, sodomy was not protected by the privacy right afforded to the marriage relationship. The court held that a determination by a lower federal courts that sodomy laws were unconstitutional was not binding on state courts, and that the state legislature had the authority to ignore the common law elements when it defined sodomy in art. 524 (1943). Therefore, the court held that art. 524 (1943) was not unconstitutional, and the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction for sodomy. The court held that because appellant was an 18-year-old male charged with committing a felony, the district court had jurisdiction over him although he was a juvenile delinquent in custody when he committed the offense.

Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that the officer's prior knowledge of appellant as a marijuana user, their recent observations, appellant's nervousness, and his dropping a matchbox in the presence of the officers was adequate probable cause for the officers to make the arrest without a warrant, pursuant to Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 14.01. The court further held that the prosecution had the right to comment on appellant's failure to call material witnesses.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for the offense of fondling. The court held that the allegations contained in the indictment substantially followed Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 535d and sufficiently apprised appellant of the acts he was charged with committing. Further, contrary to appellant's contention that the action was barred by reason of a former conviction that arose out of the same transaction, the court held that the double jeopardy provision of Tex. Const. art. I, &sect; 14 was not violated where appellant's first conviction was vacated and the court granted his motion for a new trial. Also, the complaining witness, who was nine years old at the time of the offense, was not an accomplice witness as a matter of law. Rather, this issue was for the jury to decide, and the trial court properly instructed the jury with regard to such rule of law. Finally, in the absence of any showing of injury or abuse of discretion, the trial court committed no error when it overruled appellant's motion for continuance.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of attempted burglary and the punishment was enhanced by two prior convictions. On appeal, the court dismissed the appeal because notice was not given within the time prescribed in Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 44.08. The evidence showed an attempted burglary above the storeroom and was sufficient, viewed in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, to show defendant's participation in the offense. In view of the fact that another individual had been indicted for an offense and the individual's counsel had previously talked to or attempted to discuss the facts with appellant, evidence of his testimony was not newly discovered.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence pertaining to the chain of custody of the razor, the murder weapon, and its identity, and the identity of the money was sufficient to authorize their admission in evidence. The court held that although the deceased's employer and the accomplice testified that they knew the deceased as Johnny Adair, and the only evidence that deceased bore a different name was the sheriff's testimony that the F.B.I. fingerprint report showed that to be his name, this variance did not mislead appellant or prejudice his rights. The court held that the trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion for new trial based upon jury misconduct and unsworn testimony before the jury because the trial judge interceded to recast the alleged unsworn testimony, and no objection was made to his instructions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the judgment of the trial court of Harris County (Texas), which convicted him of unlawfully carrying a pistol and imposed punishment of 181 days in jail. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in admitting the pistol in evidence because it was seized by police officers during an illegal search of the appellant's person.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When officers stopped appellant's car in a routine driver's license check, he admitted he did not have a drivers' license, and told the officers he had a pistol. The officers seized the loaded pistol and arrested him. He was convicted of unlawfully carrying a pistol. The court rejected his argument that the gun should have been suppressed, reasoning that the officers had a duty to arrest upon learning he had a pistol, and the seizure was proper in conjunction with the arrest. The officers had authority to arrest him for driving without a license, and when he admitted he was armed, the officers were entitled to search him for weapons for their own safety. The court overruled appellant's argument that Tex. Transp. Code Ann. art. 6687b, &sect; 13 was unconstitutional, relying on federal precedent specifically upholding the Texas statute over a similar constitutional challenge. The court held that the trial court was not required to instruct the jury to acquit if appellant had established a defense not refuted by the state. Noting the conflicting evidence, the court held that the jury could accept or reject all or any part of the witnesses' testimony. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment convicting appellant of unlawfully carrying a pistol, overruling appellant's argument that the pistol was seized as a result of an illegal search of appellant's person and therefore should not have been admitted into evidence. The court held that the seizure of the pistol was proper under the circumstances because it was contemporaneous with a lawful arrest for driving without a driver's license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for rape by force and threats and punishment of eight years. The court found that at the time appellant entered his plea of not guilty, he also filed written motion for probation in which he swore that he had never been convicted of a felony in this state or any other state. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting into evidence appellant's record of conviction for theft in Louisiana over appellant's objection that he was without counsel at the time of such conviction because all of the evidence was offered by the defense. The court held that a witness can be compelled to answer that he has been convicted for a crime imputing moral turpitude or the record of conviction can be introduced to attack his credibility. The court held that no reversible error was committed when the trial court refused appellant's requested charge to the jury at the conclusion of the evidence on the issue of punishment because the requested charge made no distinction between whether the conviction for theft was the juvenile proceeding shown by evidence elicited from appellant by his counsel, or the felony conviction which appellant denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the conviction, concluding that the trial court did not err in admitting into evidence appellant's record of conviction for theft in Louisiana over his objection that he was without counsel at the time of such conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to a charge of violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 1436(b)(1). Three years later, appellant again violated art. 1436(b)(1), as a result of which his probation was revoked. The sole question before the court was whether the trial judge abused his discretion in revoking the probation previously granted. The condition of probation alleged to have been violated was that appellant commit no offense. The court held that, though the allegations of the motion to revoke probation did not strictly comply with the requirements of an indictment or follow the wording of art. 1436(b)(1), such allegations were sufficient to give notice to appellant of the offense that was relied upon to show that the terms of his probation had been violated. Proof by circumstantial evidence that appellant was a principal or an accomplice was sufficient to sustain the court's finding that appellant committed the acts constituting a violation of &sect; 1436(b)(1). The court held that there was no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge in revoking appellant's probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of his conviction for robbery by assault after a jury trial in a district court in Tarrant County (Texas). Appellant complained of pre-trial publicity, seating of an objectionable juror, the judge's refusal to recuse himself, refusal to grant a mistrial, inadmissible evidence, and the trial court's refusal to pay for an investigation of jury misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury convicted him of robbery by assault, appellant sought review. Rejecting the argument for a postponement because of publicity surrounding a co-indictee, the court noted no evidence prospective jurors had read the articles. The court decided that a prospective juror was correctly seated even though he stated he would have been prejudiced against the crime. The court also found the judge correctly declined to recuse himself pursuant to Tex. Const. art. V, &sect; 11 and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 552, even though appellant had filed a civil suit against him, explaining that practice could have delayed or prevented trial. Rejecting appellant's claim to a mistrial because of a scuffle he engaged in before the jury, the court ruled permitting appellant to take advantage of his own misconduct would have reduced the administration of justice to a mockery. Rejecting appellant's arguments against the admission of evidence, the court ruled the seized evidence, penitentiary record, and reputation testimony were properly admitted. Affirming the conviction, the court ruled that the trial court did not err in refusing to provide payment for an investigation of jury misconduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for robbery by assault, explaining that the trial court was commendably patient with appellant during the trial, and no bias, prejudice, or reversible error was shown. The court added that publicity did not require a postponement, the judge did not have to recuse himself because appellant had filed a civil suit against him, and appellant's scuffle in the jury's presence was not grounds for a mistrial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his petition. On appeal, the court found that the riot and malicious destruction of property statutes were valid. The court stated defendant could not test the validity of the indictment, no matter how irregular or insufficient its averments, in a habeas corpus proceeding, nor could he challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the accusation in the indictment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In joint appeal, the court affirmed appellants' convictions of the sale of marijuana. The court held that the undercover agent was not an accomplice witness merely because he was under the age of 21 and was not a police officer. The court held that Tex. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of a trial court of Potter County (Texas), which convicted him of possession of burglary tools by a convicted felon under Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 1402b and assessed a punishment of one year in the department of corrections.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of possession of burglary tools by a convicted felon under Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 1402b and was sentenced to one year in the department of corrections. Appellant challenged his conviction, contending that art. 1402b was unconstitutional. The court rejected appellant's contention, holding that the statute was not unconstitutional. The court also overruled appellant's contention that the trial court erred in refusing to introduce into evidence that he was pardoned for his prior offenses, holding from the terms of his pardon that a pardon for any reason other than subsequent proof of innocence did not obliterate appellant's previous transgressions. In response to appellant's contention that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the fruits of the search of his truck, the court found that the evidence established that the arresting officers had probable cause to authorize the arrest and search. The truck was stopped after the officers observed it commit a traffic violation, and they saw a pistol in the open glove compartment while checking the driver's identity. This, according to the court, justified the search of the rest of the truck.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting appellant of possession of burglary tools by a convicted felon. The court held that the statute which denounced possession of burglary tools by a convicted felon was not unconstitutional and that the trial court did not err in denying appellant's motion to suppress evidence seized from a search of his truck.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the petitioner did nothing to preserve any error in the exclusion a of witness who was a principal after the state's objection to the witness was sustained.

The court found that from the statute, it was evident that the legislature intended to create and make it an offense for any person to depart from the premises of a hotel with the intent not to pay for the lodging and meals which he had obtained from said hotel. The provisions of the statute were sufficiently definite and certain to apprise any person of the nature and character of the act denounced.

Penal Code Ann. art. 726d (amended 1967), for the sale of a dangerous drug, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Appellant contended that the trial court erred in failing to quash the indictment against him because the caption or title to the 1967 amendment to include hallucinogens such as LSD in the definition of &quot;dangerous drugs&quot; was insufficient to apprise the legislature and the public of the drastic changes in penalties and the elimination of penalties for other offenses. Appellant claimed the insufficient notice violated Tex. Const. art. III, &sect; 35. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and dismissed the prosecution, holding that the Act's title, which provided the that Act would include LSD and other hallucinogens in the definition of &quot;dangerous drugs,&quot; proscribed the possession, sale, manufacture, or furnishing of any dangerous drug, declared an emergency, and summarily noted that certain sections were amended, did not give fair notice of the intent to make drastic changes in the penalty provisions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, despite his testimony at trial, was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. During his sentencing trial, the state required him, over his objection, to testify as to his prior criminal record. Defendant appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the procedure. The court reversed and remanded. It was unconstitutional, under both federal and state law, to compel defendant to testify against himself in the punishment phase before the same jury to which he had professed his innocence in the guilt phase. Defendant's right against self-incrimination obtained in his trial until his liability for punishment no longer existed. The court performed an historical survey of practice under the former and current Texas Codes of Criminal Procedure to determine that, under Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 37.07 (1967), defendant had the right to testify for the limited purpose of asserting his innocence without thereby waiving his right against self-incrimination and subjecting himself to being forced to testify about his own criminal record.

Appellant filed a motion asking the trial court to hear at the trial on the merits evidence on the issue of insanity. After the jury was impaneled and appellant had pleaded to the indictment, the trial court advised appellant's counsel to present the issue of insanity. After defendant's evidence was introduced, including the psychiatric opinions as to appellant's competence to stand trial, the state called the complainant, whose house was alleged to have been burglarized, and elicited from him evidence that appellant had committed the burglary. Appellant was convicted of burglary. The court reversed appellant's conviction, holding that appellant had been deprived of his due process right to a hearing on the issue of his competency to stand trial uncluttered by evidence of the offense itself.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. There was sufficient evidence to support the conviction because the crime of theft was complete when defendant reduced the money to his possession. It was not essential that defendant remove the money from the premises. Defendant failed to object at trial to testimony he challenged on appeal. No error was preserved for appeal. The prosecutor properly introduced evidence of defendant's prior felony convictions from another state. The secretary of state's certificates showed on their face that the statutes were in effect at the time of defendant's prior convictions. The life sentence imposed by the trial court pursuant to Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 62 was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of rape and sentenced to death. The court affirmed the judgment. Sufficient evidence existed to support the conviction. The victim testified that she was at times able to see appellant during the attack, thus enabling her to positively identify him. Appellant was not warned of his right to counsel prior to a lineup and the provision of a sample of pubic hair, but subsequent U.S. Supreme Court holdings on these matters did not control the disposition of these matters. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann art. 15.17 was not in effect at the time of appellant's arrest. Appellant was not deprived of his rights when separate trials were had before the same jury on the issues of guilt and punishment. The lineup was not constitutionally infirm. In light of the direct evidence, a charge on identity and circumstantial evidence was unnecessary. No objection in writing was made to a charge on alibi. The record showed that, contrary to his assertion, appellant did plead at the time of arraignment. The infliction of the death penalty as punishment for the crime of rape was not unconstitutional, and it was not error to permit the jury to separate before deliberations began.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant approached the injured party, put his hand on her arm, and made an obscene remark. Defendant was a 22 year-old adult male, and the injured party was a 16 year-old girl. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in refusing his motion to waive his appearance because he was a colored male and the injured party was a white female and that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence showing defendant's separate acts of accosting the two other females. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 1147, the assault was aggravated because it was committed by an adult male upon a female. The court found that defendant was not entitled to be tried in absentia under Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 33.03. The court also found that the evidence of the separate accosts was admissible on the issue of defendant's intent to assault the injured party under the exception to the general rule prohibiting proof of extraneous offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During voir dire examination for defendant's murder trial, the state challenged for cause those jurors who stated that in addition to having conscientious scruples against the death penalty, they could never vote to impose the death penalty in any case or circumstance. Convicted of murder and sentenced to death, defendant appealed his conviction on the grounds that by sustaining the state's challenge to jurors who had conscientious scruples against the death penalty, the trial court deprived him of his constitutional right to a trial by a fair and impartial jury. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that it did not err in sustaining the state's challenge to certain jurors. While acknowledging that due process voided a death sentence imposed by a jury from which were excluded all persons expressing conscientious scruples against capital punishment, the court held that the practice in Texas was not to simply excuse a juror who expressed conscientious scruples against the death penalty, but to sustain a challenge made for cause when the juror further stated that he could never vote to inflict the death penalty in any case regardless of the facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court which convicted defendant of murder and sentenced him to death. Finding no reversible error, the court held that the trial court properly sustained the state's challenge for cause to jurors who not only expressed conscientious scruples to imposing the death penalty, but who also stated that they could never, under any circumstances, impose the death penalty upon defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged a judgment of the Dallas County trial court (Texas) that, in accordance with the jury's verdict and assessment of punishment, convicted and sentenced appellant to life imprisonment for receiving and concealing stolen property of the value of over $ 50.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon his jury conviction for receiving and concealing stolen property valued over $ 50, appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment as a habitual offender. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that it was immaterial whether the plea entered by appellant to the allegations as to prior convictions was &quot;not guilty&quot; or &quot;untrue.&quot; However, the court noted that a plea that the allegations were &quot;true&quot; or &quot;untrue&quot; would seem to be more appropriate in view of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07, &sect; 1, which related to the findings of a jury on special pleas. Next, because the record did not show that the trial was a farce or a mockery of justice, appellant was not denied the right of effective counsel. Further, because appellant was given adequate Miranda warnings, his voluntary confession was admissible. Nor did the receipt of evidence relating to some 60 extraneous offenses deprive appellant of his freedom of choice as to whether to have the court rather than the jury determine the facts relating to the punishment. Finally, art. 37.07, &sect; 2(b), which authorized proof of appellant's general reputation and character, did not deprive appellant of a fair and impartial trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction and sentence for receiving and concealing stolen property of the value of over $ 50, primarily holding that whether the plea entered by or for appellant to the allegations as to prior convictions was &quot;not guilty&quot; or &quot;untrue&quot; was not material, although a plea that the allegations were &quot;true&quot; or &quot;untrue&quot; was more appropriate in view of a statute that related to the findings of a jury on special pleas.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who represented himself, claimed that the trial court erred by denying his request for a continuance or a mistrial due to illness and by denying an instructed verdict for insufficient evidence to support his conviction. The prosecution claimed that appellant's notice of appeal was not timely, appellant's brief was late, and the appeal should be dismissed. The court held that notice of appeal was given on the day of sentencing and that the court would presume that notice was given after appellant was sentenced. The court held that appellant's brief was late under Tex. Crim. Proc. Code &sect; 40.09-09 because it was filed on Monday when the last date was Sunday. However, in the interest of justice, the court considered appellant's unassigned error pursuant to Tex. Crim. Proc. Code &sect; 40.09-13. The court held that appellant's request for a continuance or a mistrial was properly denied because he presented no medical testimony that he could not continue representing himself.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder without malice in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 802c. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and overruled appellant's motion for rehearing because appellant waived having objections to the jury charge considered because he failed to comply with Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.14 and Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 36.15, which required objections to be in writing and filed before the charge was read. The court held that an agreement with the prosecution for a late filing did not alter the statutes. The court held that there was evidence that established a causal link between intoxication and the death, which was adequate to allow the jury to establish the link and not require an instructed verdict. That evidence was the conditions of the roadway where decedent's vehicle had been disabled before it was struck by appellant, which were clear and unobstructed for at least two full seconds after a truck moved over to miss the disabled vehicle, the fact that there were no skid marks, and the level of intoxication, which was measured at .211, or clearly intoxicated.

Defendant appealed the conviction, and argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it excluded business calls and that the information was void because it failed to state a criminal offense. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutional because it did not exclude a class of persons; instead, it excluded all persons if the call was for legitimate business purposes. The court held that the reasonable construction of the statute was that the business purpose exception applied only to that section dealing with harassing calls, not to the section prohibiting vulgar, obscene or indecent language.

Appellants contended that the information failed to allege that appellants met with the intent to aid each other by violence or some other means to accomplish a prohibited objective. The court found the allegations were sufficient to charge an offense under the statutes. Appellants also challenged the constitutionality of arts. 439 and 449. The court held that the statutes were neither vague nor speculative as to their meaning, gave fair notice to a person as to the conduct constituting the offense of unlawful assembly, and were not invalid as limiting persons' U.S. Const. amend. I freedoms. Appellants questioned the sufficiency of the evidence to support their conviction. The court noted that appellants continued their sit-in even after they were advised that the cafe was integrated, and affirmed the convictions because appellants were thus not asserting their civil rights or the rights of others.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction of unlawfully carrying a switchblade knife and a $ 250 fine. Appellant claimed that, because there was no definition in the statute of a switchblade knife, and such term was so vague and uncertain, it rendered the statute unconstitutional under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Appellant also argued that the information in the case was void and should have been quashed because it failed to state a crime under Tex. Penal Code &sect; 483 as it charged him with unlawfully carrying &quot;a prohibited weapon.&quot; The court noted that the term &quot;switchblade knife&quot; was well recognized and was defined in dictionaries so that the statute was not inoperative for uncertainty. The court found that, while the term &quot;prohibited weapon&quot; was not used in &sect; 483, the information did charge the carrying of a switchblade knife, which was an offense denounced by the statute.

He further argued that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for an acquittal. The court affirmed appellant's conviction and found that ex post facto was not violated. The application of the amended statute did not make the crime greater than it was under the prior statute and did not inflict a greater punishment than under the prior statute. Furthermore, the trial court did not err when it denied appellant's motion for acquittal because the state was not required to plead or prove the exceptions contained in Tex.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted him of murder without malice under Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect;802(c) for killing the deputy sheriff who was working as a motorcycle escort. Another officer found defendant running from the accident scene and testified that he was intoxicated, abusive, and uncooperative. Defendant contended that the trial court committed reversible error in admitting statements attributed to him subsequent to the collision, in permitting the introduction of a simple assault conviction as part of his prior criminal record, in permitting deceased's wife to testify, and in not declaring a mistrial when prosecutor made inflammatory remarks. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court' s judgment, overruling defendant's contentions. The court stated that defendant's statements made after the accident were admissible under the verbal act doctrine called the res gestae rule. The court also stated that the trial court properly admitted defendant's prior conviction of assault as part of his criminal record and the deceased's wife's testimony because the jury was permitted to hear that to which defendant did not object.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged her conviction for murder without malice. The conviction was affirmed on appeal. Appellant's complaint that certain paragraphs of the charge were comments upon the weight of the evidence and constituted a denial of her constitutional rights was rejected as appellant failed to object to the charge on the grounds urged as required by Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts 36.14(1965), 36.19. No objection was made to the trial court's failure to charge the jury on the lesser degrees of culpable homicide and no such charge was called for under the evidence. The court held Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.07-2(a), which provided that a charge which submitted the issue of guilt or innocence should include the punishment provided for each offense submitted, was constitutional as within the province of the legislature under the authority of Tex. Const. art. 1, &sect; 15. Further, the court found no reversible error in the trial court's refusal to allow appellant's husband to testify on direct that upon her return home, appellant told him the deceased had come at her with a gun, as the statement was later admitted as res gestae after appellant testified in her own behalf.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code Ann. art. 81, and Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 82 (repealed 1967) were unconstitutional. The court held further that art. 711 and art. 82 must yield to art. 81, and that all of such statutes must yield to the constitutional right of the defendant in a given case to compulsory process for witnesses and to have their testimony. The court overruled petitioner's contention that he was denied due process.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the evidence was sufficient because the stipulated testimony of two young school girls, as well as a judicial confession of appellant in writing in open court, left no doubt as to the guilt of appellant of the offense charged.

The court found that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. The court further found that trial in the county court upon a properly transferred indictment did not violate appellant's constitutional rights.

Defendant claimed that the marihuana evidence was obtained from an illegal search that followed an unlawful arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accosted by a police officer who knew that defendant had previously been convicted of vagrancy, and who had previously arrested defendant for vagrancy. When defendant told the officer that he was not working because he could not get a job that paid enough to make working worthwhile, the officer arrested him for vagrancy. After defendant was taken to the police station a search of defendant's person led to discovery of a marihuana cigarette. Defendant was convicted of possession of marihuana, and punishment was assessed at two years. On appeal, defendant claimed that the marihuana evidence should have been excluded because it was obtained through an unlawful warrantless search following an illegal arrest. The court affirmed. Vagrancy was an offense in violation of Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 607. As such it was disorderly conduct. Under Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 999, the officer had authority to arrest defendant for disorderly conduct without a warrant. Accordingly, the arrest was lawful, and the search that took place after defendant was taken to the police station was lawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for a murder he committed while under the age of 16 years. Appellant sought review, challenging the admission of his oral confession, the denial of his request for a mistrial and the denial of due process. The court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the absence of counsel when appellant confessed the crime did not render his voluntary statement inadmissible. The court further held that the trial court's instruction to disregard an outburst by the widow of the victim was sufficient and did not warrant a mistrial. Furthermore, the court invalidated portions of Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 2338-1 &sect; 6, as so indefinitely framed and of such doubtful construction that it could not be understood. That provision provided for the certification of a juvenile for criminal proceedings was improper for a child that was under 16 at the time of the offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged his conviction for robbery, by jury verdict, and his punishment of 35 years confinement. Two eyewitnesses identified appellant as a principal to the robbery. He was observed pointing a gun at a customer and taking a sack of money from an accomplice. Appellant denied participating in the robbery. His testimony and that of his witnesses was to the effect that he played dominoes all day at home on the date in question. The trial court charged the jury on the defense of alibi. The court affirmed the verdict, finding that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict. The court also rejected appellant's contention that the trial court erred in refusing to allow the accomplice, who was already convicted of the offense, to testify on his behalf. The court held that the statutes Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 711 and Tex. Penal Code Ann. &sect; 82, which disallowed parties charged as principals from being introduced as witnesses for one another, were not unconstitutional. Furthermore, there was no showing in the record as to what the proposed witness would have testified about, even though he was present at the trial.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and overruled appellant's contention that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction.

The court also overruled the contention that permitting the state to read the allegations of the second paragraph of the indictment, charging the prior misdemeanor conviction of driving while intoxicated before the jury had passed upon the issue of whether appellant committed the act charged in the first paragraph of the indictment, constituted a denial of due process guaranteed to appellant under the U.S. Constitution. The court did not agree that Tex.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of murder and punishment was assessed at 50 years. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling appellant's motion for a new trial. Though the jurors might have heard discussions about appellant's codefendant getting 50 years, there was already testimony during the trial from several witnesses that the codefendant was previously tried and that he was &quot;under conviction&quot; for the same offense. The court held that the trial court did not err in refusing appellant's requested charge on the corroboration of accomplice testimony for the state and as to inculpatory statements of accomplices who testified for appellant because no exception was reserved for the court's action and so the requested charge was not properly presented for review. The court held that appellant was not deprived of compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, namely his co-defendant, because the legislature had power to prescribe competency of witnesses in all cases.</SPAN></P>

He claimed that Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 666, &sect; 17a(1), was too vague, general and indefinite and failed to advise him of the charges against him. The court affirmed the conviction because it found that the statute, when read in conjunction with other provisions of the Texas Liquor Control Act that defined illicit beverages and made it unlawful to manufacture liquor in a dry area, made the statute sufficiently definite and certain.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, along with four codefendants, was charged with the offense of bribery of a Harris County probate judge. The cause was severed and transferred from Harris County to Brazos County. Defendant's case was the first to be tried and defendant was convicted of bribery. The court affirmed and held that the evidence was sufficient to support the judgment of conviction. The court ruled that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to quash the indictment, finding that the indictment followed the statute, and the allegations contained therein were sufficient to charge the offense of bribery under Tex. Penal Code Ann. art. 158. The court noted that a motion to quash an indictment could not have been based upon a claim that it was returned upon evidence illegally obtained in a court of inquiry. The court ruled that the trial court did not err in ordering a change of venue and in determining that defendant be tried first. The found that the trial court properly admitted into evidence the testimony of the deputy county clerk and evidence of a list prepared by the clerk showing all the appraisers appointed by the Harris County probate judge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator accused filed an original petition for a writ of habeas corpus seeking release from custody and discharge from a fine imposed after he was held in contempt by a justice of the peace, Precinct No. 2 of Harris County (Texas), for his refusal to testify at a public court of inquiry. Relator having been indicted, the district attorney joined in the prayer that relator be discharged and took the position that the matter had become moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator accused was summoned before a public court of inquiry investigating a scheme in which attorneys paid kickbacks to city officials. Relator was denied the right to counsel, denied the right to cross-examine witnesses, denied the right to bring witnesses in his own behalf, and was not informed of the nature of the offense being inquired into. Relator refused to testify on the ground that his rights under U.S. Const. amends. V, VI, and XIV, and Texas Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 10 and 19 were being violated. Relator was held in contempt, fined, taken into custody, and remanded to jail until he paid his fine and testified. Relator petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus. After relator was indicted, the district attorney joined in the prayer that relator be discharged from custody, and took the position that the matter was moot. The court held that the matter was not moot because relator had not paid the fine. The court granted the writ. When called to testify, relator was in the position of an accused and it was incumbent upon the justice who convened the court of inquiry to provide the procedural safeguards guaranteed an accused under the United States and Texas constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The petition was granted and a writ was issued ordering relator accused discharged. Although relator was no longer in a position to purge the contempt because he had been indicted, the matter was not moot because the fine also assessed as a punishment for contempt was still unsatisfied. The court of inquiry placed relator in the position of an accused, and compelling him to testify deprived him of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, who relied on a defense of temporary insanity, was convicted of murder for choking and strangling an 11-month old boy and was sentenced to death. Appellant had confessed to the crime, but testified that he blacked out and did not realize he was committing the act until it was over. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict. Next, the court held that the trial court did not err in refusing appellant's motion that he be examined at the expense of the state by a competent psychiatrist who was not connected with the prosecution because such services were not authorized. Appellant failed to preserve for review an issue relating to the admissibility of his military record because he never moved for admission of the record. The trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury to not consider questions to appellant about his military convictions. The use of a phrase regarding insanity did not mislead the jury and his rights were fairly and adequately protected in the charge. Finally, the jury's agreement not to discuss their deliberations was not cause for a reversal.</SPAN></P>
