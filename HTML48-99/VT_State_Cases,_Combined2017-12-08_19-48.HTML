Plaintiffs brought suit against defendants to compel the issuance of the licenses.

The court reversed the trial court's judgment and ruled that under the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont Constitution, Vt. Const. art. VII, ch. 1, defendant State was constitutionally required to extend to same-sex couples the common benefits and protections that flowed from marriage under Vermont law. The court stated that it did not rule that plaintiffs were entitled to the marriage licenses, but that they were entitled to the same benefits and protections afforded opposite-sex, married couples. The court retained jurisdiction to give the legislature a reasonable time to remedy the constitutional imbalance.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former dog owners lost their dog, which was found loose, without tags; dog was delivered to animal control, which placed notices throughout town, in accordance with the local ordinance, and then placed dog with defendant animal league, which adopted dog out to defendant present dog owners. Plaintiffs sued to recover their dog. Cross-motions for summary judgment were filed, and judgment was awarded in favor of defendants. Plaintiffs appealed, challenging the validity of the transfer of possession of their personal property, alleging a violation of their procedural due process right. Judgment was affirmed; the statute authorizing towns to regulate loose domestic pets empowered the town to take possession of plaintiff's dog at large, and the provision authorizing the sale or humane disposal of the pet constituted necessary and essential power. The town had not exceeded its authority. Plaintiffs' due process right was not deprived because the posting of descriptive notices throughout the town provided ample notice consistent with local ordinance, state law, and due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment was affirmed because statute authorizing towns to regulate running at large of domestic pets empowered town to take possession of plaintiff's dog, when found running loose without tags, and provision authorizing town to sell/dispose of pet in humane fashion constituted necessary/essential power; therefore town did not exceed its authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Commissioner of Department of Corrections appealed from judgment of Windsor Superior Court (Vermont) enjoining defendants from implementing new policy making prisoners convicted of violent felonies ineligible for parole until expiration of their minimum sentences as violative of plaintiff inmates' due process rights under Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff inmates challenged the furlough policy amended by defendant Commissioner of the Department of Corrections, which provided that offenders incarcerated for felony violence were ineligible for furlough release until serving minimum sentences. Plaintiffs filed suit, requesting that the trial court enjoin the new regulation's enforcement as unconstitutional, alleging abuse of discretion and violation of due process rights under Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 10 and inconsistency with Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 28, &sect; 808(a). The trial court declared that the policy change was constitutionally violative. The appellate court reversed, holding that the challenged policy did not violate statute or contravene plaintiffs' constitutional due process rights, since by delaying individual furlough assessments for inmates convicted of violent felonies until completion of minimum sentences, defendant was not exercising discretion inconsistent with statute or constitution. Also, plaintiffs had no constitutionally protected liberty interest in obtaining individualized furlough assessments before serving their minimum sentences.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the Declaratory Judgments Act, 12 Vt. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4711-4725, did not provide plaintiff municipalities with capacity to sue. Nevertheless, their claims fell within an exception to the general rule barring local government challenges to state legislation.

The dismissal was therefore reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant plaintiffs, tenants and a tenant advocacy organization, appealed from the order of the Chittenden Superior Court (Vermont) granting appellee mortgagees' motion to dismiss their complaint. Appellants claimed that under Vermont's Residential Rental Agreements Act (RRAA), 9 Vt. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 4451-69, mortgagees could evict tenants who entered into rental agreements with the mortgagor after the commencement of foreclosure proceedings but before the expiration of the redemption period, only in compliance with the RRAA. The defendants argued that plaintiffs' reading of the RRAA necessarily involved an implied repeal of Vt. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 4523 and 4528 with respect to tenants of the mortgagor. The court sought to harmonize those statutes with the RRAA, and held that the mortgagee's right to evict a tenant of the mortgagor through a writ of possession issued under 12 Vt. Stat. Ann. &sect; 4528 was not eliminated by enactment of the RRAA.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order dismissing plaintiffs' complaint, holding the plaintiff tenants, who were tenants of the mortgagor, were not tenants for purposes of the Residential Rental Agreements Act (RRAA) after the mortgagee became entitled to immediate possession under foreclosure statutes, so the RRAA no longer applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The defendant was bow hunting in an area where there was no open season for moose. He shot what he thought was a deer. However, as the wounded animal ran away, the defendant realized he had shot a moose, which eventually died. The defendant was convicted of taking a moose in closed season in violation of 10 Vt. Stat. Ann. app. &sect; 31(f). On appeal the defendant argued the state was required to prove specific intent to take a moose as an element of the offense, and that the statute was void for vagueness. The court disagreed, holding that the deed which constituted the actus reus for a violation of &sect; 31(f) was the shooting of the game, not the intent to take a moose, and that the statute was not void for vagueness because it gave a person of ordinary and reasonable intelligence notice of the criminally proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;Vt. Stat. Ann. tit.16, &sect;&sect; 822 and 824 authorized school districts to provide high school education to their students by paying tuition for nonpublic schools selected by their parents. Plaintiff school district filed suit against defendant state department of education when it stopped its funding after plaintiff approved payment to a parochial school under &sect;&sect; 822 and 824. Defendant counterclaimed that plaintiff violated the establishment clause of U.S. Const. amend. I and Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 3, which spoke to state support of religious worship, and sought injunctive relief. Defendant also filed a motion for summary judgment which was granted along with a temporary order prohibiting plaintiff from making tuition payments to the parochial school. Both plaintiff and defendant had groups of intervenors that were authorized by the court. Plaintiffs appealed. Defendants cross-appealed. The court held that Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 3 prohibited compelled taxpayer support of religious worship such as plaintiff's tuition-payment policy because plaintiff's policy lacked appropriate restrictions to ensure that state funds would not support religious worship. Defendants' cross appeal was moot.</SPAN></P>

The state environmental court upheld the grant of a permit but rejected the conditions imposed by appellee, finding that the two parcels of land involved had effectively merged. Appellants sought further review, objecting to the merger finding, and the court dismissed the appeal. The court found the appeal timely because the running of the appeal period did not commence until the trial judge approved and signed a written judgment order pursuant to Vt. R. Civ. P. 58. The problem with the appeal, however, was that any decision on appeal would not entitle appellants to any further relief and would not change the relief afforded. That being so, any appellate decision would be advisory. Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed for lack of a case or controversy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an attempt to comply with case law requiring substantially equal educational opportunity for public school children, the state adopted two equalization measures by enacting the Equal Educational Opportunity Act of 1997 (Act 60), Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 4000(a) et seq. One equalization measure authorized school districts, through approval by the local electorate, to raise additional revenue to fund education above the state support grant, but subjected the additional funds to an equalized-yield formula so that any specified property tax rate would produce the same funds per student in every district. Plaintiff citizens' group sued the state, contending Act 60 unconstitutionally delegated legislative authority to property-wealthy communities and failed to satisfy the state's obligation to provide all Vermont children with a substantially equal education. The lower court granted the state's motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The appellate court held that, because the challenged equalized-yield provision specified all of the details of the mechanism for equalizing the funding of public education, it was not an invalid delegation of legislative power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner placed an addition on his home located in a rural lands district. The zoning administrator denied appellant's application for a zoning permit based on noncompliance with a setback requirement. The zoning board of adjustment denied the variance request and appellant was notified of his violation. Appellant had completed work on the addition during the application process. Multiple suits over this matter were consolidated before the environmental judge, who rejected appellant's constitutional claims and determined that he violated the zoning ordinance when he built the addition. On appeal the court held the ordinance was valid and properly prohibited the expansion of noncomplying structures. Mistakes and inadequacies in zoning administration did not leave the municipality without an ability to enforce its zoning ordinance. Appellant failed to make out a case of unlawful discrimination because there was no impermissible purpose found and malicious or bad faith intent to injure was not shown. The trial court acted within its authority when it determined that the violation was substantial and that appellant committed it consciously, and awarded injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and held appellant landowner had not been discriminated against because there was no impermissible purpose for the zoning ordinance's application to appellant and there was no malicious or bad faith intent to injure on the part of the municipality.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient sought review of a decision of the Windsor Superior Court (Vermont), which granted summary to defendant physician in plaintiff's medical malpractice action against defendant. Plaintiff argued the informed consent statute's expert testimony requirement of 12 Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 1909(e) violated the common benefit clause of the Vermont constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff patient developed a lesion on his tongue and was referred to defendant physician. Suspecting cancer, defendant recommended a biopsy after five days of antibiotics and a second examination. The lesion was not cancerous. Plaintiff was transferred to another physician for post-operative care and developed another lesion. The second physician prescribed mouthwash, which was an effective cure. Plaintiff brought a medical malpractice action against defendant based on lack of informed consent. When plaintiff failed to name an expert to support his contentions concerning the first lesion, the trial court rendered summary judgment to defendant. On appeal, the court held that 12 Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 1909(e), which mandated judgment for defendant at the end of plaintiff's case if plaintiff failed to adduce expert medical testimony in support of his allegations concerning insufficient information, did not violate Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 4. Rather, where plaintiff had an available remedy at law but failed to prove an element of his claim, it was plaintiff's own failure, rather than constitutionally suspect action by the trial court, that foreclosed the remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the summary judgment rendered by the trial court in favor of defendant physician in plaintiff's medical malpractice action against defendant for a violation of the doctrine of informed consent because plaintiff failed to present adduce expert medical testimony in support of his claim. Plaintiff's bald assertions that prescription mouthwash constituted treatment option did not create genuine issue of material fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business owners sought review of an order by the Washington Superior Court (Vermont), which held that pursuant to 12 Vt. Stat. Ann. &sect; 462, a disputed driveway was the property of defendant church free of any claim by plaintiff. Plaintiff asserted an easement on the doctrine of presumed grants and laches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff business owners used a driveway on the property of defendant church for a number of years without protest. As plaintiffs' business grew and the road was increasingly busy, defendants barricaded and fenced the road. Plaintiff filed suit that sought an injunction. The parties agreed to maintain the status quo prior to trial, and after a bench trial, the trial court entered judgment in favor of defendant. The trial court held that pursuant to 12 Vt. Stat. Ann. &sect; 462, the 15 year limitation period did not apply to a church. On appeal, the court affirmed because &sect; 462 did not violated the establishment clause of U. S. Const. amend I. Section 462 included &quot;pious&quot; use among a broad class of property, the use of which was generally considered sufficiently benevolent to warrant a perpetual exemption from adverse possession, and was not an excessive government entanglement with religion. The presumptive grant was rebutted and the case was correctly decided by application of &sect; 462. Further, the court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to change the result based on laches.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of defendant church and against plaintiff business owners because the statutory provision that gave defendant a perpetual exemption from adverse possession was not an excessive government entanglement with religion. The doctrine of presumptive grants was rebutted and the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it failed to apply laches to change the result.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tribe challenged the order of the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 3, Washington Circuit, which held the cases of liquor defendant was transporting without a liquor control permit were illegally transported and subject to forfeiture under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 568.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tribe purchased cases of liquor from a liquor broker. During transport of the liquor to defendant's reservation, the state police stopped the truck, which did not have a permit to transport alcohol. The Department of Liquor Control seized the unlawfully transported liquor and the state filed a forfeiture complaint. Defendant opposed the complaint because the truck had a valid bill of lading which it asserted was a legal substitute for a transport permit. The trial court held that the bill of lading did not satisfy the requirements of a permit substitute under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 63(a), and the liquor was subject to forfeiture under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 568. On appeal the court affirmed and held that the bill of lading was not specific enough to meet &sect; 63(a) requirements. The court found that the forfeiture statute was not void-for-vagueness because the owner of the liquor could determine whether its conduct was lawful and due process did not require that it knew in advance the penalties for violating the law. The court further found that forfeiture of the liquor was wholly remedial and not subject to the excessive fine clause of U.S. Const. amend. VIII.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the forfeiture order and held that the bill of lading was not specific enough to substitute for a liquor transportation permit, and that the forfeiture remedy for illegally transporting liquor was constitutionally sound because the statute against illegal transportation was not impermissibly vague and the forfeiture was remedial and not punitive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that it was erroneous to fail to submit the issue of materiality to the jury, and the prosecutor improperly adduced testimony about defendant's pre-arrest silence. The court affirmed the perjury conviction. Defendant testified under oath at his arraignment for reckless driving and attempting to elude police that he had not driven his truck since before the date of the alleged crimes. Because defendant had not raised the issue below, the court reviewed the claim under plain error pursuant to Vt. R. Crim. P. 52(b). Even if there was a failure to submit the materiality of the perjury to the jury there was no plain error because there was no fundamental miscarriage of justice or a denial of a fair trial. The court reasoned that the materiality of defendant's statement was patently relevant in an arraignment proceeding to assess defendant's risk of nonappearance, and it was uncontroverted at trial. Also, the prosecutor did not violate defendant's right to remain silent by asking an investigator what defendant told him when asked about the police pursuit and the investigator stated defendant said talk to my lawyer because defendant was not under arrest at the time.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the District Court of Vermont, Unit 3, Franklin Circuit, which imposed sentence after defendant admitted he had violated conditions of his probation. Defendant was on probation as a result of a plea agreement resolving three misdemeanor charges for possession of marijuana, passing a bad check, and violating conditions of release.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had a fourth charge of burglary, to which he had pleaded guilty and served the non-suspended portion of the sentence, but he was on probation at the time of the plea agreement on the three additional charges. Defendant and the State agreed that all four sentences, including the burglary sentence, were to be served concurrently; however, after defendant violated probation, the trial court severed the bad check charge sentence and continued defendant on probation. The trial court revoked defendant's probation on the other three charges and defendant was incarcerated. Defendant argued that the trial court unlawfully altered his sentence under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 7042. The court agreed that the trial court was without authority to alter the sentence and strike the bad check charge, and the court struck the trial court's order. The effect of the order was to alter defendant's sentence on one charge from concurrent to consecutive, to be served after defendant was released from incarceration on the other three charges. Because defendant was serving four concurrent sentences, the trial court's modification of the sentence was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner constructed a dam which resulted in a pond on his property.

The town sought enforcement of the ZBA's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to the town, agreeing with the trial court that the landowner could not assert any affirmative defenses to the enforcement proceeding because he failed to timely appeal the ZBA's decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners petitioned the town for the repair of a highway. However, the town concluded that no repairs were necessary, except for one location. Letters to that effect were served on the landowners. The landowners then filed a complaint that stated that the town had not timely responded to their petition, and requested that the county road commissioners (commissioners) examine the road, hold a hearing, and order the town to make the necessary repairs. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the town's motion, and the court reversed the trial court's order. The court held that the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear the motion to dismiss because, pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect;&sect; 970-979, the commissioners were to consider the complaint in the first instance. The landowners were not precluded from the direct review of the town's decision not to repair the road just because it sent the landowners a letter within 72 hours denying their request. The trial court was aware that the landowner believed the commissioners should resolve the merits of the dispute in the first instance, and should have directed the commissioners to address the matter.</SPAN></P>

The town entered into a 15-year lease with the lessees. The lessees informed the town that they wanted to exercise the option to renew the lease, and the town informed them they would renew only if the lessees agreed to new terms, including higher rental payments. The lessees brought an action to compel the town to renew their lease for property under the same terms of the original lease. The trial court granted the summary judgment motion of the lessees. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that a lease of town land without any benefit to the town did not serve the public purpose; however, the town received adequate and reasonable benefits from the lessees in connection with the lease. Specifically, the town received rental payments from the lease of the land, property taxes on improvements to the land, and the possibility of obtaining title to the lessees' house at the end of the lease. By leasing instead of selling, the town retained the ability to convert the property to public use upon expiration of the lease.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) there was sufficient evidence for the board to find that the dentist failing to examine his patient after surgery, despite repeated complaints of discomfort, and instead allowing his assistant to examine the patient, determine the nature of the problem, and modify the patient's dentures, amounted to a gross violation of the standard of care; and (2) the statute,&nbsp;Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 864(b)(1), was sufficiently clear to inform the ordinary person that a dentist had to personally examine a patient that complained of pain to determine the cause of the disorder and not delegate such a task to a dental assistant; thus, the statute was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that claim preclusion did not apply to these prosecutions. Defendants were charged with a crime that was capable of frequent repetition. Each violation was separate and gave rise to separate liability. The court held that issue preclusion did not apply to these prosecutions. The State did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the constitutionality of the statute in prior proceedings, and application of issue preclusion to these proceedings would not serve the interests of justice. Under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 7403(a), (b), the State could not appeal final rulings in misdemeanor cases. In addition, the interests of justice were better served by not applying issue preclusion so that the constitutionality of the fireworks statute could be decided.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed an interlocutory appeal from an order of the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 2, Franklin Circuit, which dismissed a repeat-offender prosecution against defendant for driving with a suspended license (DLS) in violation of 23 V.S.A. &sect; 674(c) because one of the prior predicate adjudications was vacated. The charges against defendant were predicated upon two prior civil DLS violations under 23 V.S.A. &sect; 676.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following arraignment on the &sect; 674(c) charge, defendant moved in the Traffic Bureau to reopen the civil &sect; 676 adjudications. The Traffic Bureau vacated one of the two &sect; 676 convictions. Thereafter, the trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the &sect; 674(c) charge. On appeal, the State argued that the third DLS adjudication allowed criminal penalties under &sect; 674(c) even if one or both of the earlier adjudications were invalid. The court disagreed. Repeat-offender statutes could be classified into two different types: status-offense statutes and penalty-enhancement statutes. For status-offense statutes, the element of the offense was the fact of the prior conviction, irrespective of its validity. Penalty-enhancing statutes increased the penalties for subsequent violations of the same criminal law. Consequently, the enhanced penalties depended on proof of former criminal activity, usually through valid criminal convictions. The court noted that it had decided in State v. Lafountain that &sect; 674(c) was a penalty-enhancement provision. It declined to overrule Lafountain. The language of &sect; 674(c) was consistent with the intent to increase punishments for recidivist conduct.</SPAN></P>

The trial court allowed the voter to proceed on his claims for other forms of relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voter claimed that a school board's action in sending out endorsement literature before an election to approve the school budget and a bond issue violated many of his state and federal constitutional rights. Four weeks after the election, the voter filed a 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 action to invalidate the election and for other relief. On appeal, the court noted that a single state statute of limitations usually applied to all 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claims, and that the most appropriate limitations period was usually that applicable to personal injury actions, but found it unnecessary to decide whether the three-year personal injury statute applied here. The court held that invalidating an election was a drastic remedy that was not triggered by mere illegality in the election process, but rather required factors such as a severe violation of rights, the probability that it actually affected the election result, the presence culpable intent, and harm to the organic processes of the election. The court found that the allegations, while stating a cause of action for other relief, did not entitle the voter to have the election set aside, regardless of which limitation period applied.</SPAN></P>

The school and the State moved for joint permission to appeal the judgment of the Lamoille Superior Court (Vermont), which granted judgment for the State with respect to the constitutional claims, but denied it as the rest of the claims, and set the case for trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with the schools' allegation that the current school funding scheme denied equal educational opportunities to children in violation of the Education and Common Benefits Clauses of the Vermont Constitution, Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 7, and ch. II, &sect; 68. The court held that whether it applied the strict scrutiny test, or the rational standard, the conclusion remained the same; that in Vermont the right to education was so integral to the constitutional form of government that any statutory framework that infringed upon the equal enjoyment of such right bore a heavy burden of justification. The court held that the State had not provided a persuasive rationale for the undisputed inequities in the educational funding system. The court held that absolute equality of school funding was neither a necessary nor practical requirement of the constitutional command of equal educational opportunity. The court held that equal opportunity did not require precisely equal per-capita expenditures, nor did it stop cities from spending more on education if they chose, but it did not allow a system in which educational opportunity was necessarily a function of district wealth.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sent a letter to his ex-wife. He was charged in the district court with violating an abuse protection order pursuant to &sect; 1030. Defendant filed motions in the family court and the district court to strike the order on the ground that he was denied his right to due process. Both courts denied the motions. Defendant was convicted in the district court for violating the order. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and the decision of the family court. The court held that the family court had not denied defendant an opportunity to be heard because he did not request to attend the hearing, and defendant did not prove that he was prejudiced by his absence from the hearing. The court ruled that the order prohibiting defendant from contacting his ex-wife did not violate the First Amendment, and that the district court correctly charged the jury on the mens rea element of &sect; 1030. The court held that the order had expired by its own terms, so defendant's request to have it set aside was moot.</SPAN></P>

The sewer company claimed that the board erred in its methodology in determining the rate base and cost of service. The sewer company also asserted that the board exceeded its authority in denying the CPG based on acts occurring prior to regulation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The once-private sewer company became the subject of the jurisdiction of the board following the adoption of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 203(6) (1993). In its first order, the board established an initial rate base and cost of service for the sewer company, and in its second order the board denied the sewer company a CPG. The sewer company claimed that the board erred: by reducing the sewer company's rate base to reflect the percentage of development costs recovered through lot sales and then further reducing the sewer company's account for depreciation; by determining cost of service that was less than the sewer company's annual out-of-pocket expenses; and by denying the sewer company a CPG based on acts that occurred before the sewer company was subject to regulation. The sewer company also raised a number of constitutional claims, arguing that the board violated its due process rights. The court affirmed the orders of the board, finding that the methodology used by the board to calculate the rate was supported by the record and that the board did not exceeded its authority or engage in result-oriented decision-making.</SPAN></P>

The Board found that the employee's dismissal violated her constitutional right to due process of law and a contract right under a collective bargaining agreement because she was not given explicit notice that she might be discharged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee's primary duty as the most senior compliance officer for the Department of Employment and Training (DET) was to collect delinquent unemployment tax contributions. She was also an officer with her husband in a corporation that operated an automobile repair shop. She was discharged after the corporation was assigned to her for collection purposes and she failed to report the assignment, a violation of DET's conflicts of interest policy. The State challenged the Board's holding that the employee was entitled to specific notice that dismissal was contemplated. Reversing the Board's decision, the court held that, under Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, the employee's knowledge that her behavior was prohibited, coupled with notice of the charges, an opportunity to respond, and a hearing, satisfied the requirements of due process. The court also found that the labor contract did not require specific notice of contemplated dismissal. The court reinstated the dismissal because the Board could only impose a lesser discipline if it found that there was no just cause for that imposed by the DET and because the evidence and the Board's findings clearly showed just cause.</SPAN></P>

The Act specifically stated that the tax was to be refunded without interest. The taxpayers received refunds but claimed they were also entitled to interest. They argued that the U.S. Const. amend.

On appeal, the court found &sect; 448 was unconstitutional in that it violated the common benefits provision of Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 7, and reversed the summary judgment against plaintiff. The court rejected defendant natural daughter's argument that the legislature could presume the intent of the collateral relative was that his property would pass only within the bloodline. The court found presumed intent was an outdated rationale, and its effect improperly made unlawful discrimination lawful. Next, the court rejected the argument that the adoption contract between the adoptive parents and the adopted child could not bind defendant because she did not have any say in the adoption. Whether or not plaintiff had a contractual relationship with defendant was irrelevant because the basis upon which plaintiff could inherit was not based on the existence of a contract.</SPAN></P>

The evaluator found defendant competent, although of low-average intelligence. The court held that &sect; 2405(b) did not unconstitutionally place on defendant the burden of proving a safe release. The affirmative defense of safe release was not contained in any of the elements of the offense of kidnapping. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in failing to hold a competency hearing. One had been scheduled, but cancelled when, at one time, defendant decided to enter a plea. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding evidence of the wife's prior psychiatric hospitalizations or in admitting into evidence defendant's knife, found at the wife's residence. There was no abuse of discretion in the failure to grant defendant's motion to recuse the trial judge from sentencing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendants of their third DUI offense. Prior DUI convictions were uncounseled. Defendants contended that their prior uncounseled DUI convictions could not support the felony third-offense sentence enhancements. Specifically, they argued that their constitutional right to counsel was violated. A recent judicial decision held that the Public Defender Act, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect;&sect; 5201-5277, was violated when a trial judge denied counsel to an indigent person after determining that the indigent would not be sentenced to a period of imprisonment and then imposed a conditionally suspended sentence and probation. The court held, however, that defendants might have been denied counsel because of an indigent status or defendants might have validly waived the right to counsel. In such cases, the prior uncounseled convictions could be used for enhancement purposes. It was not the state's burden to show that defendant's prior convictions were obtained in violation of their rights. Rather, defendants were obligated to show that counsel was improperly denied.</SPAN></P>

The city denied the permit. The landowner successfully initiated an action, seeking a variance.

The trial court granted summary judgment to the city. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that there was not a taking. The court ruled that no damages were available for the regulatory delay because the landowner was required to exhaust the regulatory process before a determination could be made as to what, if any economic harm was caused by the delay. There was not a regulatory taking because the zoning ordinance prohibiting the restoration of a nonconforming structure, after it had been abandoned for one year advanced a legitimate state interest; it prevented the &quot;undue perpetration&quot; of preexisting, nonconforming uses. The landowner was not denied all economically beneficial use of the property during the delay because he retained the fundamental interests of ownership.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 2, Franklin Circuit, which revoked his probation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's probation officer filed a violation-of-probation complaint, alleging that defendant had violated the condition that he actively participate in mental health and sex offender counseling to the satisfaction of the probation officer. On appeal the court affirmed the revocation because defendant did not satisfactorily participate in the sex offender treatment program because of his poor attendance, his reluctance to discuss his offense during group therapy, his unwillingness to share his thoughts and feelings or give adequate feedback in group therapy, his failure to complete his homework assignments, and his unwillingness to take responsibility for his crime. The lower court expressly chose not to consider defendant's termination from group therapy because of the possibility that he was terminated for lack of payment. Further, the lower court made no findings on, and chose not to consider, defendant's unwillingness to admit acts that, while contained in the charge to which he pled nolo contendere, he denied committing. Therefore, it was not clearly erroneous for the lower court to conclude that defendant did not satisfactorily participate in group treatment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town's ordinance prohibited signs that advertised the sale or lease of real estate on such real estate. The owner had received a permit for a sign, but when a tenant left his building, he changed the sign to advertise the vacant space. The town zoning board found the sign violated the town ordinance. The superior court found the sign ordinance was unconstitutional. The town alleged the superior court misapplied the test of whether the sign was not more extensive than was necessary to serve the interest of the town. The court affirmed. An inquiry into the means-ends fit with respect to an individual challenger to an ordinance based on commercial free speech was appropriate to determine whether the ordinance was more extensive than was necessary to serve the ordinance's interest. The town had the burden of establishing that the means-ends fit was reasonable and that the scope of the restriction was in proportion to the interest served. The town's sign ordinance substantially limited the owner's ability to market his property because the alternatives available were less than satisfactory. The town failed to establish the reasonable fit required.</SPAN></P>

The hauler's claim for injunctive relief was dismissed as moot, and summary judgment was otherwise granted in favor of the district on the hauler's claims for declaratory relief and monetary damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Count I of the hauler's complaint sought injunctive and declaratory relief as to the constitutionality of the district's Solid Waste Management Plan. Count II sought injunctive and declaratory relief with regard to the collection of fees pursuant to the Chittenden County, Vt., Solid Waste Management Fee Ordinance (June 30, 1993). Count III sought monetary damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for the allegedly excessive fees collected. After a United States Supreme Court decision holding a similar flow control plan unconstitutional, the district suspended enforcement of the Plan. The district's motion to dismiss argued that Counts I and II were moot and that Counts II and III failed to state a cause of action. Treating the motion as one for summary judgment, the superior court dismissed the claim for injunctive relief as moot and dismissed all other counts without prejudice. The court held that the superior court erred by failing to address the claims for declaratory relief, that genuine issues of fact as to the Plan's burden on interstate commerce precluded summary judgment on Count II, and that Count III was dismissed in error on the basis of the dismissal of the other counts.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court found that the inquest procedures did not violate the constitutional separation of powers clause of Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 5 and reversed the decision of the district court. The court reasoned that the decision to hold an inquest was within the trial court's discretion. The court found that the nature of the inquest was in furtherance of discovery in a criminal matter and was not unlike accepted judicial functions that authorized search warrants. A general inquest under the applicable statutes was designed to determine whether sufficient evidence existed to prosecute a criminal matter. The court found that the reality of the inquest procedure did not offend the doctrine of separation of powers, but rather assisted in the judicial resolution of a criminal investigation brought by the executive branch of government.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment from the District Court of Vermont, Unit No. 3, Essex Circuit, which dismissed sexual assault charges against defendant over the State's objection after the jury failed to reach a verdict following a five-day trial. The trial court acted pursuant to Vt. R. Crim. P. 48(b)(2), which authorized it, in furtherance of justice, to dismiss a criminal prosecution with prejudice to the refiling of charges.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court based its dismissal on the possible effect of having to testify again on the five-to-six-year-old victim, the fact that the trial court would not change its evidentiary rulings at a second trial, and the age of the evidence. The court held that the trial court had the discretion to dismiss prosecutions in furtherance of justice when it would be fundamentally unfair to continue the prosecution. But the court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in granting defendant's motion to dismiss following the hung jury. The court lauded the trial court's concern for the victim but noted that there was no expert or other testimony regarding the possible effect on that particular victim of having to testify again. The court pointed out that the victim was ready to go forward with another trial despite her difficulty in testifying. The court held that, considering the fact that there had been only one prior trial, the seriousness of the charged offense, the absence of any prosecutorial misconduct or showing of prejudice that would result to defendant from retrial, the trial court should not have dismissed the case with prejudice over the State's objection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers reported federal obligation interest on their federal income tax returns but excluded it on their Vermont income tax return. The Department disallowed the exclusion and instead used the adjustment method provided in Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 5822, to calculate the taxpayers' state income tax. That is, the Department reduced the taxpayers' state tax liability by a percentage equal to the percentage that their non-Vermont income represented to their total adjusted gross income. The Commissioner, Vermont Department of Taxes, upheld the Department's assessments. The superior court reversed, holding &sect; 5822&nbsp;unconstitutional. In affirming on appeal, the court held that: (1) &sect; 5822 violated 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3124, which exempted United States stocks and obligations from state taxation, because Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 5822, did not provide an adequate exemption for federal interest income; (2) although there was a tax adjustment, the taxpayers' federal income was considered in determining their taxable income, which inclusion was prohibited by 31 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3124; and (3) where the taxpayers made timely refund requests, they were entitled to retroactive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lobbyists challenged the 1993 amendments to Vermont's lobbying disclosure law, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 2, &sect; 261(5) and (9). These amendments required lobbyists to report various lobbying efforts, such as research and other preparatory work and indirect contacts with legislators. The lobbyists also challenged Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 2, &sect; 266(3), which prohibited lobbyists from contributing to political campaigns of legislators while the legislature was in session. The trial court ruled that the lobbying disclosure law was not constitutionally vague or overbroad. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decision, finding that the lobbying law was not overbroad because it was narrowly tailored and supported several compelling interests. The court also held that the law was sufficiently definite to survive the lobbyist's &quot;void for vagueness&quot; challenge because defendant secretary of state's guidelines provided sensible interpretations of the law and the terms used in the law were sufficiently clear to put a person of ordinary intelligence on notice. The court also found that limits on contribution to legislators set by the law were constitutional as the limits were narrowly drawn.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 552(b)(2) did not offend Vt. Const. art. 10, ch. 1, so the Board could find a parole violation on less than a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board found by substantial evidence that the parolee had violated conditions of his parole, then revoked parole. The parolee filed a declaratory action challenging the substantial evidence standard in 28 Vt. Stat. Ann. &sect; 552(b)(2) under Vt. Const. art. 10, ch. 1, contending that the standard allowed the Board to find a parole violation on less than a preponderance of the evidence in violation of his state constitutional due process rights. The trial court held that the State's interest in swift administrative proceedings outweighed the risk of unjust infringement of the parolee's liberty interest. It therefore concluded that the standard did not offend Vt. Const. art. 10. On appeal, the court reversed, and remanded for consideration of the parolee's requests for injunctive relief. The court concluded that art. 10 protected the liberty interest of the parolee by requiring that a parole violation be established by a preponderance of the evidence prior to revoking parole. The court reasoned that, on balance, imposing the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard would greatly reduce the risk of erroneous parole violations while imposing minimal burden on the State.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed defendant's conviction for felony murder because the instructions improperly allowed the jury to impute defendant's mental state solely based on its determination that co-defendant had the requisite intent. The court further held that defendant did not invoke his right to remain silent during police questioning when he expressed reluctance to inculpate co-defendant, therefore, his statements were voluntary and admissible.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant reversion holders brought several unsuccessful claim in state and federal courts seeking to reclaim their purported reversionary interest in a railroad right of-way. Plaintiffs, state and city (collectively government) filed an action in the Chittenden Superior Court (Vermont) seeking to enjoin the reversion holders from trespassing onto the land. The trial court granted the government summary judgment. The reversion holders appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state acquired the right-of-way from a railroad company. The federal Interstate Commerce Commission then approved an agreement between the state and the city to use the right-of-way as a bicycle path. The reversion holders argued that the issue was moot because they conducted excavation on the land only once and had stopped. The court held that whether the state had an easement in the right-of-way or owned it in fee was irrelevant because the holder of a railroad easement enjoyed the right to the exclusive occupancy of the land. The reversion holders argued that the excavation would not have interfered with the path. But the National Trails System Act aimed to preserve railroad right-of-ways for reactivation and the excavation would have interfered with the railroad easement. The issue was not moot. The reversion holders continued to insist that they had a right to excavate on the land. The reversion holders one incident of trespass justified the injunction. Even the threat of continuing trespass entitled a party to injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The individual was cited for a violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1256 for operating a motorcycle without wearing approved headgear. The state dismissed the citation because it found the statute vague and was unable to establish the elements necessary to prosecute the crime. Plaintiffs subsequently filed the action. The court affirmed the judgment that found the headgear statute constitutional. Plaintiffs' right to pursue and obtain safety did not make the government powerless to protect the safety of individuals. The court rejected the notion that the case could be resolved on the basis of a broad right to be let alone without government interference. A statute was entitled to a presumption of constitutionality. Plaintiffs were not entitled to have the court retry legislative judgments based on evidence presented to the court. The court held that &sect; 1256 was not void for vagueness. It clearly proscribed the failure to wear an approved helmet. The court found that the Vermont Commissioner of Motor Vehicles was sufficiently clear about what headgear was acceptable. Plaintiffs were not deprived of equal protection of the law because no fundamental right was involved.</SPAN></P>

The father claimed the stepson as a &quot;dependent&quot; on the father's income tax statements, and the stepson had been living with the father and his biological mother, who was the father's wife. The trial court held that the father had no legal obligation to support the stepson, and therefore, the stepson was not a &quot;dependent&quot; as contemplated by the Act, which allegedly only allowed additional benefits for adopted or natural children. On appeal, the father claimed that the Act was unconstitutional because it violated his equal protection rights. The court reversed the judgment and concluded that the father was entitled to additional benefits under the Act because the Act created a general obligation of support on stepparents, and the stepson was legally dependent on the father. The Act was remedial in nature, and the legislature could not have intended to deprive a father of income to support a minor when the father was no longer able to work for the state.</SPAN></P>

The demonstration was confined to the public sidewalk and was orderly. The State charged defendant with obstruction of justice, in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 3015.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a mildly retarded person previously convicted of a sexual offense involving a minor. He claimed his probation warrant was void because he lacked the capacity to sign it; the district court erred by revoking probation without holding an additional competency hearing and without notifying defendant's protective services guardian; warrantless searches by probation officers violated his constitutional privacy rights; and a probation condition prohibiting possession of children's photographs violated freedoms of speech and religion. The court rejected each argument and affirmed the district court's judgment. The district court took defendant's mental capacity into consideration. There was no requirement for participation by the protective services worker. There was more than an average risk that defendant would repeat the prior offense. Thus, while certain probation conditions were flawed, the error was overcome when officers had reasonable suspicion to conduct the search, which did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights. There was no evidence that defendant retained the disputed photographs of children for either religious or expressive purposes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney appealed a decision of the Professional Conduct Board (Board) that recommended his suspension from the practice of law for six months. The attorney contended that the sanction was too harsh and that it was based on an erroneous conclusion that he violated Model Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 1-102(A) and 1-102(A)(5). The court adopted the Board's recommendation that the attorney be suspended from the practice of law for six months, determining that the attorney received adequate notice of the charges against him. The attorney disparaged opposing counsel in unauthorized communications with the opposing party. The Board's conclusion that the attorney's actions demonstrated a &quot;pattern&quot; of misconduct was supported by the evidence and was sufficient to establish that he violated DR 1-102(A)(5). The Board properly considered the attorney's prior infractions in determining the appropriate sanction. The attorney's prior disciplinary offenses within the past three years and the pattern of misconduct were distinct aggravating factors. The six-month suspension was appropriate where the attorney had been sanctioned on four previous occasions.</SPAN></P>

His conditional release required that he was not to consume alcohol or have probable cause found that he had committed a felony. Defendant sought appellate review of a decision of the District Court (Vermont) that he be held without bail.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant argued that the state failed to establish that the evidence of his guilt was great as was required to justify the denial of bail. He also alleged that, if the constitutional right to bail was not applicable, the trial court abused its discretion, and that the denial of bail deprived him of substantive and procedural due process. The court affirmed the district court decision denying defendant's bail. The court held that defendant was not entitled to bail pursuant to Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 40 because the crime with which he was charged had as a maximum penalty life imprisonment. The court also held that the state had shown admissible evidence that could convince a fact-finder that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that defendant's substantive and procedural due process rights were met by the bail hearing below. The court also held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying bail to a person who was found to have committed serious multiple and recent violations of bail conditions, and affirmed the denial of defendant's bail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred by denying his motion for acquittal and in instructing the jury that the intent required under the statute should be measured at the time he made a threat rather than at the time he placed the phone call. Defendant had called to talk to a selectman, spoke instead to the selectman's wife, and after 20 minutes, asked her if she would like to be shot. On review, the court held that the statute required the State to prove specific intent at the time the phone call was placed, not at the time the threat was made. Intent was usually inferred from circumstances rather than shown by direct proof. Thus, the trial court erred in its instructions to the jury. In addressing the motion for acquittal, the court had to consider whether the matter should be remanded for a new trial. Although it was a close question, the court concluded that a reasonable jury could not have determined that defendant made the call with the intent to intimidate. The wife's testimony indicated that defendant was initially civil, but that the tenor of the call changed as their discussion continued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant building owner appealed to the court after the Windsor Superior Court (Vermont), on the owner's appeal, from the Woodstock Planning Commission, denied his application for approval of four changes by renovation that the Commission had also denied plus denied approval for two changes that the Commission had approved. Combined was plaintiff Village of Woodstock's case brought against the owner to enjoin further renovations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission approved some renovation changes except the four that it rejected, and the owner argued that the superior court had no power to review all the desired changes that he had presented to the Commission; in other words, the superior court was limited to deciding about the four changes regarding which he had appealed. The court agreed. There was no cross-appeal. The court quoted a prior case to the effect that the appellate court had no power where the subject appeal was not perfected. However, the appeal in the case at bar was perfected. 24 V.S.A. &sect; 4472 provided that an appeal to the superior court was de novo. On the merits, the court ruled that the superior court's findings did not support its denial of approval for the six changes. More of the superior court's findings than not concerned factors that should not have been considered in deciding whether or not to grant design-plan approval; they should not have been considered as they were not criteria of the Village of Woodstock Zoning Ordinance. The court upheld a fine imposed for violation of a superior-court order even though the owner did not proceed with any post-order renovation that did not need approval.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the superior court's order that directed that the owner remove certain renovation changes of the owner's building. The court remanded the case to the superior court for design-plan review of the four changes denied by the Commission. The review was to be under the correct criteria. The court affirmed the fines imposed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with burglary, unlawful mischief, and trespass for allegedly having entered his girlfriend's residence after she had obtained a restraining order. After defendant was released on bail, he was charged with trespassing and two violations of his release. The trial court revoked bail in the first case and denied bail in the second. On appeal, the court held that the denial of bail violated Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 7554(a)(2)(C) because the trial court's findings failed to support the conclusion that &quot;extraordinary circumstances&quot; required &quot;physically restrictive conditions&quot; to protect the community and the alleged victim. Similarly, the trial court's findings were insufficient to support revocation of bail under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 7575(1), (3). The court reasoned that the girlfriend had continued to carry on an intimate relationship with defendant after she had obtained the restraining order. Moreover, there was no evidence that defendant had threatened or assaulted the girlfriend during the relevant time period. The court held that in order to revoke bail, the State had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that conditions of release were violated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court orders and remanded the case for the trial court to consider appropriate bail and conditions of release.</SPAN></P>

On review of the legislature's reapportionment decision, the court dismissed five of the citizens' petitions and remanded to the legislature with respect to one petition for revision and correction. The court determined that basic notions of fairness required that the state show that a constitutionally or statutorily deficient plan could not be improved without violating the same or other requirements elsewhere. There was nothing in the record indicating either that the legislative board or the committee considered nonnumerical criteria with respect to the district. The court concluded that the purpose of the criterion was reasonably related to a legitimate state interest. The court found no violation of any statutory or constitutional criteria. Because the citizens failed to show that there was no rational basis for the creation of the challenged district, the court dismissed the petition.

Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect;&sect; 8007, 8008 violated due process and an injunction against further extensions and revocations without the opportunity for a prior due process hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient's release on conditional discharge from a state hospital was revoked in accordance with &sect;&sect; 8007 and 8008. The patient challenged the constitutionality of Vermont's statutory scheme governing such conditional discharges. The court held that a post-revocation hearing under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 8008(e) was insufficient to meet Vermont's due process standards and that a pre-revocation hearing was required except in an emergency, whether or not requested by the patient. The court determined that a due process proceeding was required because the revocation of conditional release fell within the standard of a massive curtailment of liberty. The court explained that the patient made a convincing case that he was far freer outside the hospital than inside it to form the enduring attachments of normal life and enjoy many of the core values of unqualified liberty. The court held that under the federal constitutional standard, due process required a judicial hearing prior to recommitment, whether or not requested by the patient, unless immediate recommitment was required because the person posed an imminent danger of harm to himself or another.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both the magistrate and the trial court determined that non-attorney child support workers were not permitted to prosecute cases under URESA. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the reviewing trial court and found that Vt. Stat.

Ann. tit. 4, &sect; 461(a) which empowered magistrates to hear both child support and URESA cases, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 4, &sect; 464 empowered non-attorney child support workers to participate in only child support cases not falling within URESA. The court reasoned that the exclusion of URESA made sense because those cases were litigated under a separate statutory scheme pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &sect;&sect; 385-428. The court also found that although state attorneys could appoint others to act on their behalf pursuant to Vt. Stat.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant individual was charged with concealing material facts in obtaining prescriptions for regulated drugs. Defendant argued that a police officer violated her rights under Vt. Const. ch. 1, art. 11 when he inspected her pharmacy records without a warrant. The court held that warrantless inspection of pharmacy records maintained pursuant to state statute was permissible. The court also held that the police officer's access to the pharmaceutical records was lawful, and that his enforcement powers, which included enforcement of criminal violations of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit 18 &sect; 4223, under which defendant herein was charged, allowed him to look at prescription records in furtherance of his investigation. The court noted that defendant's statements made to her supervisors, while being threatened with termination of her employment were involuntary, but held that the state did not use the product of the coerced statements in its investigation and the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged the amount of their personal income tax assessment. The taxpayers challenged the assessment on two grounds: that the state personal income tax could not be applied to the recapture of federal investment tax credits under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 5822, and if &sect; 5822 was applicable, the application violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court reversed the lower court judgment because the assessment was unconstitutional as applied to the taxpayers. The court determined that &sect; 5822 was unconstitutional because similarly situated taxpayers would be required to pay disproportionate state income taxes. The department of taxes required the taxpayers to pay a state income tax on federal recapture of investment credit despite the fact that the taxpayers had not received a prior benefit from the investment credit. The court concluded that the calculation of the taxpayers' state income tax liability should have excluded the recapture of the investment credit from federal tax liability since there was no prior benefit derived from the credit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The environmental group and the Native Americans argued, inter alia, that the board erred in basing its own analysis of statewide need on evidence not properly before it and that the board erred in refusing to consider evidence of human rights deprivations of the Native Americans that would result from the Canadian producer's facilities construction. The court affirmed the board's decision. The court found that the board overstepped its proper role by making separate computer runs because it relied in part on data and programs not in evidence and created evidence that went beyond recalculation. However, the court could not find that the error sufficiently tainted the board's conclusions to require reversal; furthermore, the environmental group and the Native Americans waived the issue by failing to object and failing to raise the ground in their post-judgment motions. The court rejected the contention that a consideration of the rights of the Native Americans was required for a finding that the purchase would promote the general good of the state under Vt. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff argued that the family court erred in finding that changed circumstances existed to justify modification. The family court found that plaintiff's reinitiation of plans to move to another jurisdiction was an unanticipated changed circumstance, therefore the family court did not abuse its discretion in reaching the merits of the motion. The court maintained however that at the time of divorce plaintiff was given the right to decide where she would reside with the children. The court also stated that no state statute required the plaintiff to make an affirmative showing of cause to justify removal or discouraged relocation. The court held that the proper inquiry for the family court was to determine the appropriate custodial parent in light of the change in circumstance, and that state policy encouraging parent-child contact did not supersede plaintiff's reasonable decision to relocate. The court held that the family court incorrectly sought to determine whether it was in the best interests of the children to relocate with their mother, therefore the family court's modification of the custody order imposing a restriction on where plaintiff could reside was improper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's motor vehicle license was suspended after being with driving under the influence. The driver argued that (1) the administrative suspension proceeding was essentially criminal and so required the procedural trappings of a criminal trial; (2) the court's implementation of the administrative suspension proceeding improperly impinged on the powers of the legislature; and (3) the expert testimony was admitted without a proper foundation. The court determined that the license suspension was not a punishment for purposes of the Fifth Amendment because &sect; 1205 served the rational remedial purpose of protecting public safety by quickly removing potentially dangerous drivers from the roads. As a result the proceeding was not criminal and the driver was not entitled to the protections accorded to criminal defendants. In addition, there was no violation of the separation of powers established by Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 5 because the constitution established the judicial power for rule promulgation. Finally, the driver's argument regarding the expert testimony was based on a rule of evidence and administrative license suspension proceedings were not governed by the rules of evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court converted the complaint into a habeas corpus proceeding, held that the department's rule was unconstitutionally vague, and expunged the conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that habeas corpus was a proper means for reviewing the department's disciplinary measures that prolonged defendants incarceration period. The court noted that habeas corpus was unavailable where inmates intentionally avoided the administrative grievance procedures available to them, but that defendant did not intentionally avoid the administrative procedures to gain a tactical advantage.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff dairy farmers appealed the judgment of the Rutland Superior Court (Vermont), which dismissed the farmers' action under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 against defendants, Commissioner of Agriculture (commissioner) and State Treasurer (treasurer), in their official and individual capacities. The farmers had challenged the constitutionality of the Dairy Industry Income Stabilization Program (DIISP), Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 6, &sect;&sect; 2991-2998.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The farmers, who were not members of a cooperative, challenged the DIISP and contended that there was no rational basis for the program's exclusion of farmers who were not members of a cooperative, and that such discrimination violated their constitutionally protected freedom of association. The trial court granted summary judgment against the farmers and dismissed the action in its entirety. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court first noted that the farmers' claim was not moot, despite the expiration of the DIISP, because equitable relief was available. The commissioner and treasurer, in the scope of their employment, had competently executed a simple and definite duty mandated by a statute that violated none of the farmers' clearly established rights. The court recognized an exception to the general rule that only officers performing discretionary duties were to be given immunity and held that officers who obeyed a simple and definite statutory command in good faith were qualifiedly immune. As such, the dismissal of the commissioner and treasurer in their individual capacities was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant consented to a breath test after the police stopped him for DUI. The police cited defendant after advising him of his rights under the civil license suspension procedure in Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1205 (amended 1991). Defendant waived a hearing on license suspension and he pled guilty to DUI after his motion to dismiss based on double jeopardy was denied. The supreme court held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution did not bar the criminal prosecution and punishment of defendant for DUI after his driver's license was suspended in the civil proceeding. Defendant's license suspension was not a punishment for double jeopardy purposes. The plain language of &sect; 1205 indicated legislative intent that the summary suspension was of a civil nature. The court found that the suspension, although involving an affirmative restraint, was nonpunitive in nature. The court found that the revocation of a privilege voluntarily granted indicated remedial action. The court found that the summary suspension scheme served the rational remedial purpose of protecting public safety by quickly removing dangerous drivers from the road.</SPAN></P>

On review, defendant argued that the police entrapped him. The court found that defendant was not entrapped because the police acted on a tip by an informant that defendant was seeking to commit the crime. Furthermore, even though the undercover officer who was acting as a prostitute was persistent in questioning defendant, a reasonable juror could have found that the officer was seeking clarification of the relationship defendant was seeking to establish. Also, it was defendant who first raised the issue of sex for money. The court also found that the statute under which defendant was prosecuted, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2632(a)(6), did not violate either the federal or the Vermont constitution on equal protection grounds. The court reasoned that defendant was treated under the statute the same as any similarly situated offender. Therefore, the trial court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff accident victim, citing Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 1202, appealed a decision of the Rutland Superior Court (Vermont), which entered judgment of dismissal in favor of defendant executor pursuant to the statute of limitations, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 557(a), in the accident victim's action against defendants, executor and driver, for injuries suffered in a collision between vehicles operated by the driver and the decedent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accident victim contended that the statute of limitations was tolled by Vt. Stat.

Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 557(a) denied him due process of law unless such notice was given. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the accident victim was a creditor for purposes of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect;&sect; 1201, 1202. The court pointed out that &sect; 1202 added four months to the statute of limitations only where notice was given to creditors under &sect; 1201, and stated that as notice to creditors had been excused by the probate court and no notice given, the tolling provision did not apply. The court concluded that while the degree of state involvement with respect to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 557(a) was sufficient to constitute state action under the Fourteenth Amendment, the balance tipped decidedly against forestalling indefinitely the commencement of the limitation period until the executor personally notified the accident victim of his appointment. The court determined that operation of &sect; 557(a) did not deny the accident victim due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The employer argued that Vt. Stat.

On appeal, the court held that award of attorney's fees to individuals who were successful in workers' compensation claims only had to be rationally related to a legitimate public purpose. The court found that the desire to make the employee whole was a rational reason for allowing the award and that &sect; 678(a) was constitutional. The court ruled that the award of attorney's fees was proper in the employee's matter because, by prevailing on two of her three claims, she had substantially prevailed on her claims and was entitled to reasonable costs and fees.</SPAN></P>

Her inquest statements were read into the record and were the only evidence that defendant was a burglar. The State claimed that the recorded recollections were sufficient to prove defendant's guilt. The court held that there was insufficient evidence to convict defendant. The foundational requirements of Vt. R. Evid. 803(5) to admit the inquest testimony were met because the witness did not remember the information, the testimony was relevant, and the testimony was made when she remembered the information. However, because defendant was unable to cross-examine the witness' inquest testimony at the trial, the evidence was insufficient to convict defendant because her statements were the only identification of defendant as a burglar. The witness' testimony did not have the indicia of reliability to be sufficient to convict defendant because it was made more than six months after the burglary and she made an unknown statement to the police.

The court found that the closure order ran afoul of the requirement that reasonable alternatives be considered.

The bank presented evidence that the building, with its large glass curtain, was difficult to insulate. Attempts to alleviate the heating and cooling problems without changing the facade had proved unsatisfactory. The city argued that the trial court erroneously failed to consider the later registration of the building as a historic place. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that: (1) the trial court was entitled to be skeptical about how the historical listing came about and to consider that skepticism in assigning weight to the listing where the building was evidently added as an item of new business by a city council member after the controversy arose; and (2) the trial court's construction of Burlington, Vt., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 18 was reasonable and its decision was not clearly erroneous.</SPAN></P>

The employees remained employed and received disability benefits for at least a year before the city mandatorily retired them. At retirement, the employees had accumulated thousands of hours of disability leave for which they were not compensated. Benefits for disability leave were equal to full pay, but benefits under the retirement system were less. The employees filed an action against the city seeking disability leave benefits. The superior court found that the employees were not entitled to benefits. The employees appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the employees' contract did not entitle them to benefits. The court explained that employee's right to accumulate and use disability leave was not rendered meaningless by Burlington City Code art. III, &sect; 24-77, which terminated these rights when the employees became totally and permanently disabled. An employee could use accumulated disability leave as long as he was able to resume his duties in the future.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents' daughter sustained fatal injuries when a vehicle that was operated by a drunk driver struck her. The parents' Dram Shop Act (DSA), Vt. Stat.

On appeal and cross-appeal the court reversed and remanded. The court found that the decedent was injured &quot;in person&quot; and would have been entitled to maintain an action under the DSA had she survived. The court held that the parents as administrators of the decedent's estate had a cause of action pursuant to the DSA and that damages should have been determined under the Wrongful Death Act (WDA), Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 1491-1492. The court further held that the WDA was a remedial act to be construed liberally and that the provision of the WDA that allowed for pecuniary damages for the loss of a minor child did not exclude such damages when the child was not a minor. Finally, the court found that tit. 7, &sect; 104(8) sufficiently designated and delimited areas of administrative regulation by an agency and that it was not, therefore, an unconstitutional delegation of power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A confidential informant told the police that someone from another state would be transporting cocaine into Vermont and would be taking part in a substantial drug deal. The police stopped defendant's car and ordered the occupants out of the vehicle and immediately seized two bags of what appeared to be cocaine from underneath the front passenger seat. Defendant was arrested and subsequently convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the police had sufficient probable cause to search the car. Police corroboration of the predicted movements, coupled with the fact that police officers observed defendant bend down in the car as if he were placing something under the front passenger seat, was sufficient information for the police to believe at the time of the search that there was a fair probability of finding evidence of a crime in the car. The details provided by the informant were substantial, and the actions of defendant were suspicious enough, for the police to reasonably believe that there were drugs in the car. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 2251(b), the legislature created the commission to promulgate rules regulating real estate brokers. The commission was to be comprised of seven members, three of whom could not be members of a professional real estate association. The association argued that &sect; 2251(b) was unconstitutional because it deprived its members of their rights of freedom of association. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the association's complaint. The court determined that the association failed to show a significant impairment of its associational rights or any demonstrable injury resulting from its members having to disclose whether they belonged to an association. The court held that the requirement of disclosure and nonmembership in an association was rationally related to the state's legitimate interest in creating a commission with broad representation. The court further held that because the enabling act gave the commission the authority to regulate brokers' listing agreements, the commission's regulations requiring brokers to specify their authority to offer the properties were within the commission's delegated statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff individuals filed suit against defendants, two landowners and the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, seeking enforcement of a restrictive covenant and a subdivision regulation, Vt. Code R. tit. 5, &sect; 1203301, at 020 (1982). The Agency cross-claimed against the landowners to enforce the regulation. The Bennington Superior Court (Vermont) entered a judgment in favor of plaintiffs and the Agency. The landowners appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed suit alleging that the landowners violated the covenant and the regulation by placing a mobile home on their property. The trial court found in favor of plaintiffs and granted their request for injunctive relief. The trial court also found that the landowners, by failing to obtain the necessary permit, violated the regulation, which required a lot owner to obtain a permit prior to erecting a building that required, for useful occupancy, the installation of plumbing and sewer treatment facilities. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court first determined that the covenant was enforceable because it was in writing, it &quot;touched and concerned&quot; the land, there was privity of estate between the parties, and the original subdivider intended for the burden of the restriction ran with the land. The court also found that the trial court was correct in finding that the landowners violated the regulation by failing to obtain a permit. The court concluded that the Agency's reading that the regulation was applicable was not plainly erroneous, that the regulation was not void for vagueness, and that the delegation of authority to the Agency was not unconstitutionally broad.</SPAN></P>

The exclusion of certain witness testimony by the trial court was not in error. Testimony by the trooper that defendant informed him that he was dyslexic was irrelevant as that condition had no effect on the trooper's probable cause to arrest defendant for driving under the influence, and such testimony was hearsay under Vt.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, appealed from a judgment of the District Court, Unit No. 3, Orleans Circuit (Vermont), which found that he had committed a delinquent act by engaging in lewd and lascivious conduct with a child, a violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2602.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that defendant, when almost 15, had committed a delinquent act based on evidence that he had engaged in inappropriate sexual activity with a girl who was almost nine. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that under the plain language of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 33, &sect; 632(a)(3) and Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 12, &sect; 2602 defendant could have been found guilty of having committed a delinquent act. The crucial inquiry was whether the act committed was designated a crime under a statute, not whether defendant could have been criminally prosecuted under the statute. Moreover, under the facts, considering the age disparity of the participants, &sect; 2602 was sufficiently certain to inform a person of reasonable intelligence that defendant's conduct was proscribed. Furthermore, any error that might have been made by not allowing counsel to question the victim's mother regarding allegations that the victim had falsely accused others of inappropriate sexual conduct with her was harmless. Defendant had admitted a certain degree of sexual contact with the victim, and the trial court allowed testimony from the victim's brother that the victim had falsely accused others.</SPAN></P>

The Commissioner did not notify the driver of a right to request a presuspension hearing on an out-of-state conviction; instead the suspension automatically became effective five days after the date of mailing. The driver was charged with driving with license suspended and was assigned counsel. The driver requested a hearing on the suspension. The Commissioner held a hearing and confirmed the driver's suspension. The district court dismissed the driver's appeal because the driver had not requested a hearing before the Commissioner within 10 days of the initial suspension, despite the Commissioner's failure to notify the driver of his right to a hearing. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that given the Commissioner's failure to notify him of his rights, the driver's failure to request a hearing within 10 days of the suspension did not constitute a waiver of his rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to &sect; 325, the lumber company petitioned the town for permission to lay out a right-of-way to remove logs across the landowner's property. The town granted the petition, provided that the lumber company pay the landowner for the estimated damage to his property. The landowner brought a suit that claimed damages under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for an unconstitutional taking of his property. The trial court concluded that the temporary right-of-way across the landowner's property did not constitute an unconstitutional taking and dismissed the suit. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the landowner had either accepted the damage amount ordered by the town or waived the payment. The court ruled that the landowner foreclosed the &sect; 1983 action by foregoing the appeals process or by not seeking timely injunctive relief. The court held that the underlying injury necessary to make out the &sect; 1983 action was never put in issue, and the lumber company's logging operations have long ceased. The court ruled that damages based on the speculative abstract value of the alleged violated constitutional right were not a permissible element of compensation in &sect; 1983 actions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 14-year old juvenile, was charged with murder while perpetrating a sexual assault on a minor. Pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 33, &sect; 632(a)(1)(B), the action was commenced in criminal court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly murdered his seven-year-old cousin while sexually assaulting her. The trial court applied the applicable Kent factors, which were the seriousness of the offense, the manner in which it was carried out, the personal nature of the offense, the merit of the charge, the maturity of the individual, the individual's record and history, and the prospects for protection of the public and rehabilitation of the individual and concluded that a transfer of defendant's action was not warranted. On appeal, the court found that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 33 &sect;&sect; 632(a)(1)(B) and 644(c) controlled the question of jurisdiction and that the criminal court had jurisdiction in the case at bar. The court held that the burden of proof properly resided with defendant to show that his action should have been transferred to the juvenile court.

An investigation began into whether she had improperly submitted false pay vouchers for days that she did not work.

She was charged with several counts of false swearing, and the trial court found her guilty of three counts. Defendant appealed, arguing that she was entitled to acquittal because the Prosecution conceded that she was surprised by certain questions at the inquest, and surprise negated the specific intent to deceive, a required element of false swearing. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's surprise would not necessarily have negated a wilful intent to lie. The State's argument did not constitute a concession of surprise, and it was for the jury to determine if she was surprised. There was ample evidence that defendant added her signature to certain jackets, and the jury had sufficient evidence to conclude that her testimony at the inquest was a false denial.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect;&sect; 2241-2283, but denied an injunction under a zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town and officials had amended the ordinance to force the removal of the householder's junk cars. They argued on appeal that he lacked standing, and that the amendments were valid. The householder contended that the zoning amendment was passed solely to eliminate his vehicles and thus violated Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 7, and that his junkyard was grandfathered under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect;&sect; 2241-2283. The court reversed and remanded. The court stated that the householder had failed to show that he had any title, and thus lacked standing. The court found that the zoning amendment reflected the town plan, which attempted to limit development and maintain environmental quality, and that it was thus not invalid. The court found that the storage of numerous junk cars and a boat was not an accessory use customarily incidental to a residence, and that the zoning amendment was not unconstitutional, and determined that dismissal of the complaint and the failure to afford relief under the zoning ordinance were error. The court determined that there was no evidence under which a finding that the householder maintained a junkyard without a license could be made or affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers appealed an order of the Washington Superior Court (Vermont), which, on remand from the United States Supreme Court, dismissed the taxpayers' actions against defendants, State of Vermont (state) and Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, seeking refunds of use taxes paid by the taxpayers under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 8903(b) on their cars that were bought in other states. The lower court also declared that certain issues were moot.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After paying sales tax on their cars that were bought in other states, the taxpayers moved to Vermont and paid a use tax on the cars as required by &sect; 8903(b). The taxpayers filed actions seeking a refund of the use tax. On remand from the Supreme Court, which declared that &sect; 8903(b) was invalid under the Equal Protection Clause as it purported to afford unequal treatment to state residents and nonresidents without sufficient justification, the lower court dismissed the taxpayers' actions and declared that the taxpayers' request for declaratory relief was moot. On appeal, the court affirmed the dismissal of the actions, but vacated the lower court's declaratory judgment ruling. The court held that (1) the Eleventh Amendment barred the taxpayers' actions, which were brought under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, for monetary relief; (2) the taxpayers had no private right of action under the Fourteenth Amendment; (3) the state was entitled to sovereign immunity because Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 8914 provided the taxpayers with an appropriate administrative remedy for the recovery of wrongfully levied purchase and use taxes; and (4) the lower court lacked jurisdiction to award declaratory relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arraigned in the district court on charges of simple assault. Thirteen jurors were seated, which provided for just one alternate. Realizing that defendant eventually might be tried by fewer than 12 jurors, the trial court asked both counsel, during an on-the-record bench conference out of the hearing of defendant, whether they would agree to proceed with 11 jurors in the event that more than one juror was not able to continue. Both counsel agreed, with defense counsel emphasizing that less than 11 jurors would have been unacceptable in any event. On the first day of trial, the trial court stated in open court (on the record in the presence of defendant) that two jurors were not present and that counsel had agreed to continue with 11 jurors. Defendant first raised the issue on appeal. The court affirmed. The decision to stipulate to an 11-person jury was a &quot;tactical&quot; or &quot;strategic&quot; one that could have been made by counsel with defendant's implied consent. Defense counsel's on-the-record oral stipulation to an 11-member jury, confirmed in defendant's presence, did not deprive defendant of his constitutional right to trial by jury.</SPAN></P>

The license applicant appealed, and the court also affirmed, holding that the Board's findings were rational and that it had acted within its legitimate interest in regulating the psychology profession in the state. The license applicant's due process rights were not violated by the notice and appeal provisions of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, ch. 55, Vt. Stat.

In each case, DSW reimbursed the state for benefits paid more than two years before the date of the SSI award. Petitioners argued that Vt. Welfare Assistance Manual &sect; 2600d limited the reimbursement to GA payments made within two years of the SSI award. DSW claimed that the board properly deferred to DSW's interpretation of its own regulation by ruling that &sect; 2600d authorized DSW to reimburse the state for all GA payments issued to the recipient, not just those awarded within the previous two years. The court reversed, finding that SSI was among those resources and benefits subject to the two-year limitation. A 1976 amendment to &sect; 2600d was not intended to increase an SSI recipient's liability for GA payments. Instead, it continued to treat all the listed sources the same. The court held that DSW's interpretation of &sect; 2600d was inconsistent with the regulation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner class members sought review of the judgment from the Chittenden Superior Court (Vermont) that dismissed their action that sought a declaration that an administrative directive ordering the delay of most civil jury trials for budgetary reasons was unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class members filed an action against defendants, supreme court, justices, court administrator, and clerks, that asked the trial court to declare a directive invalid and to direct the restoration of civil jury trial cases. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss and the class members appealed the decision and filed a petition that sought a declaration that an administrative directive ordering the delay of most civil jury trials for budgetary reasons was unconstitutional. The issue raised was whether the administrative directive violated Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 12 or Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 38. The court held that the class members failed to show specific prejudice or that their trials were being delayed unreasonably. In support, the court reasoned that caseloads could not be managed on the simplistic position that everyone was entitled to an immediate trial whenever they were ready for one. The court noted that trial judges had broad authority to manage dockets. Therefore, the court concluded that the jury right was not infringed when access to juries was delayed for a relatively short period of time.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the parties disagreed over the applicability of the language, which excluded fuel and electricity from the manufacturing exemption and subjected the electric department to the sales and use tax. The court found that the commissioner defined &quot;fuel&quot; as a material used to produce heat or power by burning and as something consumed to produce energy. The court held that the commissioner did not err in his construction of the statute and that the trial court correctly affirmed the decision.

The trial court dismissed defendants' motion to dismiss the informations, and defendants appealed, alleging six points of error. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that the compulsory education requirement statutes were not unconstitutionally vague and did not violate the right to the free exercise of religion in violation of the United States and Vermont Constitutions. The court also held that the informations charged the essential elements of the crime and did not fail to protect defendants against reprosecution.

The claimants were litigants whose cases were pending in the superior and district courts. They brought a petition for extraordinary relief pursuant to Vt. R. App. P. 21, asserting that the directive violated their rights under the Vermont and United States Constitutions and sought to have the directive declared unconstitutional. They argued that the justices should be disqualified because they promulgated the directive and their participation in the challenge to its validity violated Vt. Sup. Ct. Order 10, Canons 1, 2. The court denied the claimants' motion and held that state supreme courts had a range of powers and responsibilities in governing the judicial branch of government and adjudicating controversies. The directive involved was issued pursuant to the court's administrative control of all the courts of the state, as provided in Vt. Const. ch.

The property owner appealed to the board, which denied the permit. Not having received written notice of the decision within the 45-day period set forth in Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 4470(a), the property owner treated it as an approval and commenced work. In his appeal, the property owner argued that a decision was not rendered until he was given written notice. The court rejected the contention, finding that the property owner's construction of &sect; 4470(a) was inconsistent with its language and that the legislature did not intend a deemed-approval remedy. Thus, the court held that because the property owner had actual notice of the decision, the decision was considered rendered.

Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1205(a). The district court had concluded that a police officer had properly stopped the driver on suspicion of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, thereby allowing suspension of his operator's license since he refused to submit to an evidentiary test.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver's position was that he had offered to take a test within the prescribed 30 minutes and that the State failed to prove refusal. The driver's insistence that his own doctor, who was not available, be present to administer the test was a precondition amounting to a refusal. A police officer observed the driver as he talked to his attorney, and the court held that it was the State's observation of the driver's demeanor during the conversation that was at issue, and as nonverbal conduct, that demeanor was open to observation by others. No use of the content of the conversation between the driver and his attorney was made during trial, and therefore no error was committed in allowing testimony about his apparent ability to converse without breathing difficulties. The court refused to reconsider its prior approval of the procedures surrounding the suspension of operator's permits upon failure to submit to a breath test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant admitted that he had passed the two vehicles by using the breakdown lane, but testified that his maneuver was required by concern for his safety when the two vehicles effectively blocked both lanes of traffic. Key to defendant's argument that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1091(b) was unconstitutionally vague was the contention that the phrase &quot;in willful disregard&quot; was undefined and constitutionally vague. The court was satisfied that the phrase &quot;willful disregard for the safety of persons or property&quot; was sufficiently clear to inform persons of reasonable intelligence just what the statute proscribed. The nature of willful conduct at the wheel of a vehicle should have been especially clear to the average driver, for whom knowledge of rules of the road is not only a legal necessity, but a requirement for survival. To the extent that defendant contended that his conduct on the road necessarily amounted only to mere negligence, the court disagreed, underscoring its observation that on the record it was open to the trier of fact to conclude that defendant's maneuver was consciously and purposefully undertaken, thereby meeting the standard for willful conduct.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs asked defendants to help reconstruct the division fence and pay a proportionate share thereof. Defendants, who owned no livestock, refused. Plaintiffs built the fence and sued to collect defendants' share of the sum expended. The trial court held that defendant's were liable under Vt. Stat.

The court held that &sect; 3802 was unconstitutional as applied to persons who owned no livestock. The court noted that the law's purpose was to benefit landowners with livestock. The claim that defendants benefited to the extent that they were protected by straying livestock was not persuasive because, absent the fence law, the liability for their trespassing livestock would lie solely with plaintiffs. The court held that requiring an adjoining owner who did not keep livestock to share the cost of a fence for the benefit of a neighbor was not reasonably necessary to any legitimate public purpose.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of burglary, and the trial court denied his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence consisting of the accomplice's admission of perjury. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed, holding that the offer of immunity to the accomplice was not illegal because there was no evidence that it had been conditioned on her testifying in any particular manner. Further, the accomplice's testimony was sufficient to convict defendant because corroborating evidence was not required and the jury was free to believe or disbelieve the accomplice. Although the accomplice had recanted her testimony, defendant was not entitled to a new trial because the recanted testimony was not newly discovered evidence. In making that determination, the court focused on the fact that defendant was not surprised by the testimony when it was given and he had the opportunity to impeach the accomplice at that time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment from District Court, Unit No. 1, Windsor Circuit (Vermont), which refused to reconsider defendants' sentences. In two consolidated misdemeanor cases, a driving offense and a simple assault on a police officer, a lesser sentence than the statutory minimum sentence was imposed, on grounds that the minimum sentences violated the proportionality clause of Vermont's constitution and defendants' rights to allocution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 674(a) mandated a two-day minimum sentence for driving with a suspended license as a result of a conviction for driving while under the influence, but the trial court imposed a zero to 30-day suspended sentence. And, although Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1028 mandated a minimum 30-day sentence for simple assault on a police officer, the trial court imposed a sentence of zero to three months, suspended. The court found that the minimum sentences were disproportionate and violated Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 39. The court noted that the legislature was entitled to make incremental changes in the sentencing structure. The court also held that the trial court's interpretation of Vt. Const. art. X as including allocution was unfounded because that article referred to defendants' rights to testify in their own behalf, which were separate from their allocution rights. However, the court found that the State's requested remedy, that defendants be resentenced in compliance with mandatory minimums, would require the unfair incarceration of defendants more than three years after the crimes were committed, due to an error on the part of the trial court and delay in the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court upheld the validity of the statutory minimum sentences and held that the trial court erred in ignoring them. However, the court declined to grant the State's request for extraordinary relief against defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, Vermont Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, Governor, Secretary, Vermont Commissioner of Public Safety, and Vermont State Treasurer, appealed a decision from the Washington Superior Court (Vermont), ordering a refund to plaintiff taxpayers of taxes paid under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect;&sect; 415, 3007, 3010 and held pursuant to an earlier order of the trial court in an escrow account.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants attacked the validity of the trial court's order on the grounds that it violated the separation of powers doctrine and constituted an impermissible &quot;end run&quot; around Vermont's sovereign immunity. The legislature's reenactment of the decal tax, which removed the provisions rendering it facially discriminatory, did not take into account the possibility that actual discrimination would still have resulted from its imposition. The trial court's conclusion, that the actual discriminatory effect would have rendered Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect;&sect; 415, 3007, 3010 invalid on the merits, was supported by the findings of fact. There was ample support for the trial court's conclusion that the taxpayers made a showing of potential irreparable harm. The trial court's order that notice be given class members by publication in a national trade journal was within its discretion and comported with the requirements of Vt. R. Civ. P. 23(d)(2). Because the result involved no new rule of law and there was no inequity in granting the taxpayers a refund, a United States Supreme Court decision need not have been applied prospectively, so as to preclude the taxpayers' recovery of the escrowed funds.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision ordering a refund to the taxpayers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant government officials appealed a decision of the Washington Superior Court (Vermont), which declared a reciprocal truck tax, Vt. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The class of taxpayers challenged a reciprocal fee imposed on certain trucks registered in states other than Vermont, claiming that it discriminated against interstate commerce. After the court determined that the fees were unconstitutional, the legislature again amended the fee system. The court found the challenged provisions unconstitutional. The taxpayers did not challenge Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 417(a). The taxpayers then commenced a third action to challenge &sect; 417(a). The trial court declared the reciprocal truck tax unconstitutional and ordered the government officials to refund the taxes collected and reserved in an escrow account. The court affirmed, holding that the doctrines of issue preclusion and claim preclusion did not prevent the taxpayers from challenging the truck tax because the causes of action and the issues were not the same in the earlier litigation. Section 417(a) discriminated against out-of-state trucks on its face and therefore violated the Commerce Clause. The trial court's order complied with Vt. R. Civ. P. 65(d) where it specified its terms in reasonable detail. Sovereign immunity was not applicable in a challenge to the recovery of escrowed sums.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother sought review of a decision of the Caledonia Superior Court (Vermont), which denied the mother's request for habeas corpus relief to obtain custody of her two minor children that were in the custody of respondent, the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS). The mother contended that the SRS custody was unlawful because there was no valid juvenile court disposition order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the mother had abandoned her children, the parties stipulated that a children in need of care and supervision (CHINS) determination was appropriate, under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 33, &sect; 654(a). A disposition hearing was held, and the children remained in foster care since the hearing. Because no written order was ever entered, the mother challenged the SRS custody. The trial court found that a disposition was made within the spirit of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 33, &sect; 634(a). The court noted that habeas relief for child custody purposes was not based upon the legality of a restraint on liberty under habeas corpus statutes but rather was based upon common law. The defects were not jurisdictional, and the mother's petition was fatal because she failed to show that a return of custody was in the best interests of the children. The court overruled that portion of In re B.M.L., 137 Vt. 396, 406 A.2d 383 (1979), that required the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus solely on a finding of unreasonable delay in making a merits finding without consideration of the best interest of the child. The mother presented insufficient evidence to allow a collateral attack of the custody determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer's property was listed for property tax purposes at 120 percent of fair market value pursuant to an amendment to the city charter which allowed this increased valuation of nonresidential property. The taxpayer challenged this provision as unconstitutional under both the common benefit clause, Vt. Const. art. VII, ch. 1, and the proportional contribution clause, Vt. Const. art. IX, ch. 1. The trial court refused to grant the taxpayer summary judgment and instead sent the relevant issues to the appellate court. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court ruling denying summary judgment and remanded the action. The court found that relevant city charter provision satisfied the fundamental requirements of a valid tax in that it was reasonably related to the purpose for which it was established (increased city revenue); and it was fairly and equitably applied among like classes of taxpayers. The taxpayer failed to present any reason why the classification scheme was not reasonably related to the valid legislative purpose of raising overall city revenues.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient's Crohn's Disease impaired his ability to absorb vitamin B-12; surgery exacerbated this problem. Under accepted medical standards, he had to be told to take B-12 injections for the rest of his life. The physicians failed to do so and later misdiagnosed a critical B-12 deficiency. Ten years after his surgery, the deficiency was diagnosed by other doctors; the patient then commenced his malpractice action. The physicians claimed that the action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations and the seven-year statute of repose. The patient claimed that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing amendment of the answers to raise that defense. The court held that the trial court had discretion to allow the amendment but applied the incorrect legal standard in holding that the statute of limitations ran from the date of discovery of the patient's injury rather than the date when the patient also discovered the cause of the injury. Although the applicable statute of repose, which was enacted after the patient's injury, applied retroactively, the statute of repose could not constitutionally be applied to destroy the patient's vested right to recover for his injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developers sought to compel appellees to allocate sewer units to its planned subdivision, to enjoin the town from allocating sewer units to competing residential projects, and to declare appellees' sewer allocation policy to be void. The trial court found the town's policy to be within the VPDA, was not an impermissible taking of the developers' property, and was not a denial of their equal protection rights. On appeal, the court affirmed because (1) to the extent that the population density and growth controlled by the sewer policy were related to the load on the sewer disposal system, the town could allocate capacity through the sewer policy, as a power incidental to managing the sewage system; thus, the sewer policy did not violate Vt. Stat.

He was arraigned on charges of reckless endangerment and simple assault, in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect;&sect; 1025, 1023(a)(1). The trial court imposed an appearance bond finding that defendant posed a risk of flight. The trial court also imposed a peace bond to insure that defendant would keep the peace. Defendant appealed the bail decisions. The court affirmed the appearance bond but reversed and remanded on the peace bond. The court found that it was reasonable for the trial court to find that defendant was a flight risk based on his probation history. The court also found that no notice was given that a peace bond was under consideration and that there were no specifications of the factual issues involved. The peace bond was set as a form of bail for preventive incarceration, which was not authorized by statute. The court, therefore, found that the peace bond was not supported by the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

On further review, the court affirmed and held that the language of &sect; 1205(e) made it clear that the trial court was only required to find that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the driver was operating or was in control of the vehicle. The court concluded that such construction implemented the legislature's intent that the need to request a test be determined through the eyes of the officer and not through the hindsight of the trial court. The court found that reasonable grounds existed because the driver told the officer that he had operated the vehicle. The trial court correctly applied a preponderance of evidence standard in making its determination. Moreover, because the evidence on the factual issues was overwhelming, the standard of proof was of no practical significance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' property, along with all other vacation properties of six acres or less, was reappraised by the town. No other classes of property were reappraised. The reappraisal resulted in increasing the listed value of the landowners' property. The landowners appealed to the Board, contending that the town's selective reappraisal violated Vermont's Constitution. The Board found that the town's rolling reappraisal violated the constitutional requirement that all property in a town be assessed at a uniform rate. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the town's appraisal procedure met state and federal constitutional requirements. The court found that the town's rational basis for utilizing a rolling reassessment of property, keeping appraisals as current as possible within the resources available, served a legitimate purpose. Further, the court found that the landowners' property was vacation property and was, therefore, dissimilar than other properties in the town. Thus, there was a real, unfeigned difference between persons owning different classes of property, and the decision to attack the class with the greatest degree of underassessment was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant landowners appealed from an order of the Vermont Environmental Board asserting Act 250 jurisdiction, which authorized a permit with conditions for creation of a subdivision and construction of a road serving the subdivision. The landowners challenged the assertion of Act 250 jurisdiction over the project and over their other properties not involved in the project and argued that the board was estopped from requiring a permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two of the landowners purchased together a 110-acre tract of land. They sold 17 acres of this land to the third landowner, who applied for a permit to construct a road to his property. The district coordinator indicated that an Act 250 permit was not required because it was really a long driveway. The three landowners further subdivided their lands and applied for a permit to extend the &quot;driveway&quot; as a road to benefit a planned eight-lot subdivision. The board approved issuance of a permit with conditions, finding that the entire 110 acres was &quot;involved land&quot; and subject to Act 250 jurisdiction. The court held that the board's &quot;road rule&quot; did not unconstitutionally exceed the bounds of the agency's enabling legislation in its definition of a &quot;development.&quot; The legislature had passed a public act ratifying all of the board's rules and they therefore had the effect of statutes passed by the legislature. The fact that the district commission did not issue its decision until four days after 20 day statutory time limit did not warrant issuance of the permit without conditions. The landowners could show no injury resulting from the delay. Estoppel did not apply against the government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a practicing surgeon. He was charged with and arraigned on 29 counts of filing false claims with the Medicaid Program. The information alleged that defendant knowingly filed and caused to be filed false claims in violation of &sect; 2581(d), and defendant filed a motion to sever the charges, which the trial court denied. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on two counts. Defendant was accused of filing forms which billed for consultations when, in fact, the services in question involved only an office visit. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the state's information was sufficient to charge a single scheme or plan. Therefore, defendant had no absolute right to severance under Vt. R. Crim. P. 14(b)(1)(A). Further, the failure of the trial court to charge deliberate overcharging as an element of the offense and the failure of the state to prove this alleged element did not constitute error. The court also found that defendant's motion to dismiss did not equate with an assertion of the speedy trial right. The length of delay was only a short period beyond the administrative order. Thus, there was no denial of a constitutionally mandated speedy trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant was convicted of burglary, he appealed. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in admitting at trial evidence of his prior convictions of breaking and entering and possession or concealment of stolen property for the purpose of impeaching his testimony that he was intoxicated and incoherent at the time of the offense. On appeal, the court reversed and held that the trial court failed to adequately weight the probative value of the prior convictions against their prejudicial effect. The court found that an especially severe possibility of prejudice existed because five of the eight admitted convictions were similar to or the same as the crime of which defendant was accused. The extensive recitation of defendant's criminal record was also highly prejudicial. The court determined that other means of impeachment were available to the State. The State pointed to several facts from the crime scene that demonstrated defendant's high cognitive functioning at the time of the offense. However, the court noted that the State did not depend on defendant's own testimony and that it was, therefore, not necessary to impeach the same by evidence of prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

With regard to the state law claims, the attorney general and the welfare commissioner were shielded absolutely from any civil liability because the actions complained of were within the general scope of their authority. The deputy and assistant attorneys general were protected from liability by qualified immunity because no bad faith had been demonstrated in the discretionary actions of investigating and prosecuting the owner. With regard to the claims under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for violations of the owner's rights to privacy, a fair trial, and to travel, the attorney general and the deputy and assistant attorneys general, as prosecutors, were absolutely immune for all actions, except the press conferences to which they were protected by qualified immunity.</SPAN></P>

He was certified as an emergency medical technician in Georgia. He was not, however, certified to perform emergency medicine in Vermont.Defendant argued that his medical work was motivated by his religious convictions. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that Vt. Stat.

Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 4472.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The applicant appealed the Board's denial of his permit, under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 4471. On the Board's motion for a declaratory judgment, the trial court ruled that the applicant was entitled to judicial review of the Board's decision but the trial de novo provision of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 4472(a) violated the separation of powers provision of the constitution, Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect; 5. On appeal, the court ruled that &sect; 4472(a) did not violate separation of powers principles. The court rejected the Board's claim that, because during a de novo review a trial court was not restricted to the record of the Board's hearing on a matter and because the trial court was not required to give deference to the Board's decision, a trial court exercised a legislative or executive function. The court ruled that, in rendering its decision, the Board was performing a quasi-judicial function. A trial de novo of an administrative agency action was permissible if the agency operated in a quasi-judicial capacity in reaching its decision. The Board was performing a quasi-judicial function in determining the applicability of a valid city zoning ordinance to the facts of the applicant's case.</SPAN></P>

Following his guilty plea to sexual assault of a girl less than 16-years old, a violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 3252(3), the district court sentenced defendant to not less than two years to not more than seven years imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to a sentencing hearing, defendant pled guilty pursuant to a sentencing agreement with the State. Although force was not an element of the offense, The court held that the district court properly considered evidence regarding whether defendant used force in committing the act. The court decided that the evidence was relevant for purposes of sentencing because it described the nature of the assault and defendant's proclivities, which assisted a determination of an appropriate sentence. The court rejected defendant's contention that he was entitled to a jury trial on the use of force because no right to a jury existed in sentencing. The court decided that defendant's guilty plea waived any obligation of the State to assert the use of force in its pleadings under &sect; 3252(3). The court found no requirement that the State assert that defendant used force. The court, however, ruled that evidence of the use of force was relevant for consideration of defendant's propensities and the circumstances under which the crime was committed. The court rejected defendant's contention that proof of the use of force at sentencing must have been established with proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the district court's judgment. The court vacated its prior order that dismissed defendant's appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the first contention but found error on the second contention and, accordingly, reversed for further proceedings without having reached the third contention. The court held that the quarry companies had to base their bias allegation on a prejudgment of the law, not a prejudgment of fact, namely that the board sends cases to the trial court. The court noted that the quarry companies had full access to the court for review and while the board authorized the trial court action, it was pursued by the attorney general. The quarry companies argued that the board failed to give them the opportunity to offer evidence that the permit should not have been revoked, although they were told repeatedly that they would have that right. The court held that the quarry companies were denied this right and therefore, the court vacated the revocation order and ordered a new hearing solely on the remedy to be imposed for breach of the permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters of the town voted to change the zoning of the land owned by the company. The amendment required a two-thirds vote of the selectmen. The court found that it was difficult to achieve a super-majority vote where there was a large population base. The legislature could have found that higher populations introduced new and different zoning and planning problems that warranted differences in the governmental response. Because the distinction was not arbitrary, there was no equal protection violation. The zone change met the test of consistency because the town plan contemplated the use of highway-commercial zoning at one or more of the interstate highway access points. It suggested certain detailed regulation that had not been adopted. There was a certain irony in a claim that a zoning classification voted for by a majority of the residents of the town provided no benefit to the community. The court held that adequate public benefit had been shown and the zoning classification was not invalid as spot zoning. The court affirmed the order.</SPAN></P>

A grand jury, which was to have been impaneled that same day in order to investigate the alleged criminal acts, had to be excused because numerous prospective members had read or heard news accounts of the alleged criminal activity. A complaint against the attorney was filed with the board. The attorney replied that Vt. Code Prof. Resp. DR 7-107(A) did not apply to his statements. In addition, to two other questions, the board certified the question of whether Vt. Code Prof. Resp. DR 7-107(A) applied to defense counsel. The court responded in the negative and determined that under the plain and ordinary meaning of Vt. Code Prof. Resp.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was dismissed by the employer following an argument over whether the employee was required to substitute for company truck drivers who were absent. The employee filed for unemployment benefits. His request that a subpoena be issued to a bookkeeper who was present at the time of the dismissal was denied by the claims examiner. The possibly edited written testimony of the bookkeeper was admitted over the employee's objection. The claims examiner found that the employee previously substituted for absent truck drivers and held his refusal to continue to do so constituted misconduct. The office of the appeals referee upheld the examiner's determination that the employee was disqualified. The board affirmed the appeals referee. On appeal, the court reversed the board's decision. The court held that: (1) the appeals referee owed the employee a duty to provide assistance in presenting his case consistent with the referee's duty to decide the issue impartially; and (2) the availability of a subpoena should have been a quid pro quo for the examiner's considering hearsay evidence from the employer; and therefore it was a denial of due process to refuse to issue the subpoena.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the board's decision, which upheld a determination that the employee was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. The court held that the refusal to issue a subpoena was a denial of due process and if not a denial of due process, it was an abuse of discretion and a failure to conduct the proceedings in such manner as to ascertain the substantial rights of the parties. The court remanded the case.</SPAN></P>

The electric company sought to place liens on the landlords' property. The Board enjoined the electric company placing liens on the real property in its attempts to collect unpaid utility bills of their former tenants. The Board based its injunction on a ruling that the lien provisions of the electric company's statutory charter were unconstitutional. The electric company appealed. The court held that the Board was without jurisdiction to rule upon the constitutionality of statutes, and vacated that portion of its order. Only the courts had jurisdiction to consider constitutional questions, and the question of the constitutionality of the charter could be brought before a court without a requirement of an exhaustion of administrative remedies. The court affirmed the remainder of the order, which enjoined liens as part of the electric company's collection attempts.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 678(b) to appellee employee after he prevailed in the court on the employer's appeal of the decision of the Commissioner of Labor and Industry, which awarded workers' compensation benefits to the employee.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee prevailed before the Commissioner in his claim for workers' compensation benefits. He did not file a claim for attorney's fees under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 678(a) prior to the employer filing an appeal of the award. The employee again prevailed in the court, and the special master determined that the fee amount agreed upon between the employee and his attorney was reasonable. The fee award only pertained to the appeal before the court. On appeal of the special master's determination, the employer contended that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 678(b) violated the Equal Protection clause. The court held that the classification between employer and employee was rational. The legislation, authorizing the payment of attorney's fees to successful employee claimants in workers' compensation appeals, was intended to assist employees in obtaining the benefits awarded to them by the Commissioner. The legislation was not unconstitutional.&nbsp;Section 678(b) did not authorize the court to award fees for the cost of the employee's representation in front of the Commissioner. The employee did not timely avail himself of the right to request fees under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 678(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee worked for the state and was injured on the job. The employee received workers' compensation benefits and later applied for disability retirement benefits through the state retirement system based upon the accident for which he received his workers' compensation benefits. The board approved the payment of disability benefits, but offset the state's share of those benefits by the amount of the workers' compensation award. The lower court entered judgment for the board. Upon appeal, the court affirmed, holding that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 466 was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority, for it gave clear mandatory guidelines for the board to follow. The board followed the clear mandate of the legislature in offsetting under &sect; 466, any amounts received by the employee, including that portion of his award allocated to attorney fees. The fact that the board chose to offset the employee's disability retirement allowance by his workers' compensation award after he stopped receiving the workers' compensation award is of no import, since the manner of offsetting the workers' compensation award is within the board's discretion under &sect; 466.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aiding in the concealment of stolen property by the Bennington Circuit Court (Vermont) and appealed the trial court's denial of his pretrial motion to suppress the product of a warrantless search by state police officers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his wife were staying in a trailer at a camp, where the individual running the camp knew them and knew that they were staying on the premises, although he had not expressly granted defendant permission to reside at the camp. State police officers arrived at the property at a time when defendant was not there and searched the trailer and seized certain property located at the camp. At his trial, defendant moved to suppress the property seized during the search, but the trial court determined that he lacked standing to challenge the validity of the search. On appeal, the court held that Vt. Const. Ch. 1, Art. 11 set forth the applicable test whether defendant could challenge the search as his possessory interests, rather than the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, which considered defendant's expectation of privacy. The court found that, under Article 11, defendant had an interest in the trailer since he was rightfully residing there at the time of the search. Because defendant had standing to challenge the search, the trial court's denial of the motion to suppress on those grounds was incorrect and had to be reconsidered.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the matter for further proceedings on the merits of the suppression motion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff City appealed a judgment from the District Court, Unit No. 2, Chittenden Circuit (Vermont) that granted defendant newspaper's motion to dismiss the City's action to collect a fee to place newspaper vending machines on City sidewalks, under Burlington, Vt., Code of Ordinances &sect;&sect; 27-31, 27-32.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The newspaper placed vending machines along public streets within the City. The newspaper was later informed by City officials that the placement violated the ordinance. In the City's suit to collect the fees, the trial court agreed with the newspaper's claim that the ordinance was an unconstitutional prior restraint on the dissemination of news and was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. In affirming the trial court's judgment, the court ruled noted that arbitrary discretion vested in governmental authority was inconsistent with valid time, place, and manner regulations in that the governmental discretion could suppress particular points of view by discriminating against licensees on the basis of what the licensee intended to say. By vesting two City officials with the power to grant or deny a permit without legislating guidelines or standards to be used by those officials when granting or denying a permit, the ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness. The court also ruled that the ordinance would directly affect the newspaper's exercise of its First Amendment rights which was not, as the City claimed, the assertion of a vicarious right of its readers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state officials sought review of a decision of the Washington Superior Court (Vermont), which granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, an appointed justice, in the justice's declaratory action challenging the constitutionality of statutory provisions for the appointment of justices of the state supreme court. The trial court found that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 4, &sect; 5(a) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">New provisions of the constitution, Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect;&sect; 33, 34, fixed terms of judicial offices at six years and allowed for the governor to make interim appointments to fill a vacancy. Under constitutional authority, the legislature enacted Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 4, &sect; 5(a) that provided for six year terms for justices, except in the case of appointment to fill a vacancy. The justice was appointed to fill the unexpired term of a retired justice, pursuant to the terms of &sect; 5(a) and the appointment practices prior to the constitutional amendments. The justice contended that he should have been appointed for a full six-year term. The trial court agreed, and improperly found &sect; 5(a) to be unconstitutional. The question for the court was not whether the solution offered by the justice was better but whether the present statutory procedure withstood constitutional scrutiny. The court found that interpretation of the constitutional provisions was necessary and that terms of office were treated as fixed and not measured by incumbency. Therefore, the prior practice of filling unexpired terms was properly enacted as procedures under the new provisions of Vt. Const. ch. II, &sect;&sect; 33, 34.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the trial court's judgment that held a statutory provision unconstitutional and remanded the cause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, former employees and representatives, brought an action against defendants, a former employer and a firm. The employees sought damages that allegedly resulted from age discrimination by the employer. A trial court (Vermont) dismissed their claims for wrongful discharge, wrongful death, and claims for infliction of emotional distress, but denied summary judgment on a claim of tortious interference with contracts. The employees appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employer sought advice from the firm during a time when profits were lower than expected. Based on the firm's advice to change &quot;a retirement home image,&quot; the employer fired the employees. The employees argued that the employer did not have the right to dismiss or fire them solely on the basis of age even though they were at-will employees. The employer argued that there was no public policy under Vermont law prohibiting the discharge of an at-will employee on the basis of age because at the time of the discharge there was no statutory directive as to age discrimination. The court rejected the employer's arguments, holding that the absence of a statutory directive was not dispositive of whether a public policy against such practices existed at the time of discharge. The court held that the discharge of an employee solely on the basis of age was a practice so contrary to society's concern for equity and justice that there was a clear and compelling policy against it. The court also held that the trial court correctly refused to grant summary judgment to the firm because whether the firm's actions were the proximate cause of the employees' losses were issues of fact.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of the employees' claim for wrongful discharge, the claims for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and the claim for the wrongful death of one employee. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of summary judgment on the claim of interference with a contractual relationship. The court also remanded the matter for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The case was remanded for further proceedings on the issue of damages. The trial court's factual finding that the company had falsely represented the availability of the tax credit sufficiently supported its conclusion that the company was liable under the CFA. Also, absent a showing that a misrepresentation was false when made and known to be false by the defendant, an action for fraud could not lie.

Appellees challenged the orders, and the trial court declared them unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that persons subject to nonhospitalization orders were entitled to the same due process protections as persons subject to commitment orders insofar as the right to periodic review of their mental health status was concerned. The court found that the State's issuance of orders of indefinite duration without a hearing violated appellees' right to due process because the State failed to provide some mechanism to periodically review the status of appellees to determine whether continued treatment was justified.</SPAN></P>

In addition to the DUI arrest, defendant was arrested and convicted for disorderly conduct in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 1026(1). She challenged that conviction, arguing there was no violent conduct sufficient to justify a conviction under the statute. Defendant also asserted that the statute itself was unconstitutionally vague. The court found that defendant yelled, screamed, kicked, and resisted her arrest. She had to be restrained with ankle cuffs, handcuffs, and a seatbelt. Two police officers were required to hold her. The record also indicated the defendant attempted to bite one of the police officers. The court concluded that this conduct more than justified the trial court's finding of violent behavior as contemplated by &sect; 1026(1). Moreover, the court also held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because it was sufficiently clear for defendant to have known that the conduct in which she engaged was prohibited.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superior court found that the statutes challenged by plaintiffs in a class action violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution by discriminating against interstate commerce. Defendants alleged that the trial court sitting in equity and consisting of a presiding judge and an assistant judge, had no jurisdiction to hear the case and the fees imposed pursuant to the challenged statutes did not violate the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court found that the challenged components of Act 172 failed to survive scrutiny under the &quot;discrimination&quot; element or prong. Therefore, it did not matter which test was applied. The court affirmed the superior court's decision that provisions of Act 172, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect;&sect; 415, 3007, and 3010, are unconstitutional and unenforceable. The action for a tax refund was a suit against the state, and therefore, was barred by sovereign immunity unless the state had waived its immunity. The Vermont legislature had not inferentially indicated its intent to provide the amounts paid to the state under a statute later declared invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's order declaring the statutes unconstitutional and affirmed the denial of a refund of taxes collected under the Act.</SPAN></P>

Ann. tit. 32, &sect;&sect; 5811(13), (11)(A), for the entire calendar year. The Commissioner upheld the denial and the taxpayers brought an action against the Commissioner to challenge the denial. The court held that: (1) the prior residency aspect of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 5922, extended the credit only to taxpayers who resided in Vermont for the entire calendar year in which the system was installed and violated the Equal Protection Clause because the residential distinction served no legitimate state purpose; and (2) the invalid prior residency requirement was easily separable from the remainder of the legislation that granted the tax credit.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer filed an action against the body shop, seeking damages for unsatisfactory repairs to his car. The body shop's attorney was a member of the Vermont State Senate. On the date of trial, the attorney filed a letter with the trial court stating that he was not familiar with the case and requesting that the trial be scheduled on another day so as not to interfere with his legislative duties. The attorney did not appear on the trial date. The trial court held a trial in his absence and entered a judgment for the customer. The trial court denied the body shop's motion to set aside the judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect; 496(f) provided that legislators were entitled to a leave of absence or a continuance in cases in which their legislative duties were more compelling than a judicial proceeding. The court determined that the attorney's letter failed to raise &sect; 496(f) and that it did not ask for a continuance. The court ruled that the trial court properly denied the body shop's motion to set aside the judgment pursuant to Vt. R. Civ. P. 55(c) because it was not a default judgment.</SPAN></P>

R. Crim. P. 12.1 and then requested that the district court instruct the jury that the State bore the burden of proof of a defendant's sanity beyond a reasonable doubt, notwithstanding the state statute placing the burden of proof of insanity upon defendant. On appeal, the court held that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 4801(b) placed the burden of proving insanity upon defendant as an affirmative defense, which demonstrated an intent by the legislature to eliminate sanity as an essential element of crime. The court noted that the legislature was not required to use words, which expressly eliminated sanity as an essential element where its language was inconsistent with any other interpretation. The court found that there was no impediment under the state constitution to requiring a defendant in a criminal case to prove his insanity where he intended to rely upon a defense of insanity to excuse his conduct. The court concluded that where the State proved every element of the crime charged, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 4801(b) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 33, &sect; 2581(d) criminalized knowingly filing either a false claim for Medicaid reimbursement and the information did charge defendant with a crime. The court also found that a person of reasonable intelligence would understand the actions prohibited by &sect; 2581(d) and it was not unconstitutionally vague. A jury instruction on fraudulent intent was not required because &sect; 2581(d) was sufficiently explicit to be enforced according to its terms without such instruction. The record evidence was sufficient for a reasonable factfinder to conclude what drug defendant actually dispensed and there was no abuse of discretion when the trial court allowed testimony of dollar amount, rather than the number, of claims filed by defendant. The court held there was sufficient probable cause to issue the search warrant for defendant's barn and its wording authorized the seizure of the prescription receipt log. The seizure of documents not covered by the warrant was permitted under the plain view exception when they were inadvertently discovered while sorting documents covered under the warrant. Therefore, the court affirmed defendants' conviction.</SPAN></P>

The vehicle's engine was not running, and the lights had been turned off. The officer found defendant asleep behind the wheel, smelled the odor of alcohol, and saw a half-full beer bottle on the seat. Defendant's performance on various physical tests indicated that he was impaired. At trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict and defendant appealed. The court affirmed the judgment. The meaning of &quot;physical control&quot; was not so vague that defendant was unable to determine what was prohibited. The charges to the jury accurately stated the law with reference to the facts proved. The turn-off area was clearly a part of the roadway and the police officer had a perfect right to investigate a motor vehicle parked along the side of a road after dark.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The water district's assessment was based on the number of structures on a parcel of property that were equipped with one or more toilets. The assessment plan did not differentiate the amount of an assessment regardless of whether a structure was equipped with one toilet, or many, as in the case of an apartment building. The property owner had 12 cottages on his property and received an assessment for each of the cottages, while he received one assessment each for his residence and his apartment building. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and entered judgment in favor of the property owner. The water district's assessment plan constituted &quot;unjust discrimination&quot; in the provision of municipal services in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution. The water district failed to overcome the owner's equal protection challenge to the assessment plan by showing a rational basis for imposition of an assessment against a structure based on the existence of a toilet and not the level of water use in the building. The evidence did not support the water district's claim that the assessment plan eased administrative burdens.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants seeking equitable remedies before the Washington Superior Court (Vermont), which was composed of a presiding judge and two assistant judges. A judgment was later decided holding that the composition of the superior court did not have jurisdiction to hear a case involving an equitable matter. The court remanded the case to determine whether the new judgment should be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In their briefs and at oral argument, both parties argued that the new judgment should be applied prospectively only. The court agreed. A decision should meet several criteria in order to be applied prospectively. First, it should establish a new principle of law, either by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants may have relied, or by deciding an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed. If this criterion was met, a court should inquire whether retroactive application would be inequitable. Where a decision of the court could produce substantial inequitable results if applied retroactively, there was ample basis for avoiding the injustice or hardship by a holding of nonretroactivity. The court held that the new judgment should not require that the parties' case be remanded for a new trial. The parties' case was tried before the judgment had been handed down. The new judgment established a new principle of law that was not clearly foreshadowed. Also, applying the new judgment would result in substantial hardship and injustice to the parties, as the complaint in the case had been filed over seven years ago.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the new judgment applied prospectively only, and the order remanding the case for a new trial was stricken.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the railroad paid the sales and use tax imposed by the Department, it then sought a refund from the Department. The Department refused the refund, and both the Commissioner and the trial court upheld that decision. The railroad appealed, urging that the Department erroneously held that the diesel fuel was not exempt from the sales and use tax and that there was a constitutional violation if over-the-road transportation carriers were allowed the exemption, but that rail carriers were not allowed the same exemption. The court looked to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 9741 and found that sales of motor fuel were exempted. Thus, if diesel fuel was motor fuel, the railroad was entitled to the exemption. The court found that diesel fuel was motor fuel. Thus, the railroad was entitled to the exemption. By so finding, the court did not reach the constitutionality issue suggested by the railroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 7614, the patient was ordered three times to undergo a psychiatric evaluation as part of the preliminary process to determine if he was a person in need of services under Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 7101(17). When the patient failed to appear for his evaluation all three times, the district court ordered that the patient be involuntarily committed for three working days so that he could be psychiatrically evaluated. The court held that the patient was not to be involuntarily committed just to be psychiatrically evaluated against his will without a full consideration of all less restrictive and feasible alternatives. The court reasoned that although the confinement was only for three days and for the limited purpose of evaluation, it was an impermissible curtailment of the patient's liberty. Because there was interference with the patient's liberty, less restrictive alternatives should have been reviewed, including outreach home evaluations with a psychiatrist and the use of expert opinion evidence at a commitment hearing in the absence of a psychiatric report, pursuant to Vt. R. Evid. 703 and Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 7622(b).</SPAN></P>

On appeal from a judgment for the commissioner, the court held that: (1) because he purchased the car while a resident of Wisconsin and registered and used it in Wisconsin for more than 30 days, the taxpayer was not entitled to an exemption; (2) the taxpayer's right to register his car did not arise to the level of a fundamental constitutional right or implicate the fundamental right to travel; (3) as such, the &quot;rational basis&quot; test applied, under which Vermont's motor vehicle purchase and use tax did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because it furthered a legitimate State purpose of paying for the maintenance of the highway systems; and (4) the exemption classification, which applied to residents, who buy in reciprocal states, was not arbitrary but was based on a reasonable legislative policy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer engaged in substantial Vermont activities although its corporate headquarters and principal place of business were in New Hampshire. The taxpayer purchased an aircraft in Rhode Island for use by the corporation to transport personnel, as well as equipment and parts to Vermont, and for the operation of a charter service. Approximately 17 percent of its flight time was attributable to Vermont. After an audit, the Department of Taxes (department) assessed a use tax deficiency in light of the taxpayer's use of the airplane in Vermont. The commissioner upheld the deficiency. The trial court upheld the department's right to impose the tax, but held that the tax had to have been apportioned based on the taxpayer's use of the airplane in Vermont. The commissioner appealed that part of the trial court's order requiring the use tax assessment to be apportioned. The court held that apportionment of the use tax was neither constitutionally required nor legislatively authorized. The taxpayer failed to show any cumulative tax burden or any risk of multiple taxation. Vermont had a tax credit, in lieu of apportionment, which eliminated the possibility of cumulative use tax liability.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, arguing that his conviction, resulting from his religiously based refusal to permit an autopsy, violated his right to the free exercise of his religion protected by U.S. Const. amend. I and Vt. Const. art. 3rd.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's daughter died during her home birth. After briefly examining the baby, the examiner was unable to determine the cause of death and therefore refused to sign a death certificate. Instead, the examiner informed the prosecution and the chief medical examiner, who decided that an autopsy should be performed. Defendant refused to allow an autopsy, claiming that his religious beliefs forbade the performance of an autopsy on his child. As a result of this refusal, defendant was unable to obtain a death certificate. Defendant buried his daughter without the burial permit. Defendant appealed, arguing that: (1) Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 5205(f), which allowed the prosecution or chief medical examiner to order autopsies, was unconstitutional; (2) the prosecution failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's daughter was a &quot;person;&quot; and (3) the prosecution's questions to witnesses about the death of another child in the defendant's church, and the autopsy performed on that child, denied defendant a fair trial. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant has failed to show that his church believed in the practice of burying the dead without autopsies.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction. Defendant's decision not to allow an autopsy was an individual one, based on the particular situation and not on a fundamental belief of the members of his church. Defendant's conduct was not protected by the free exercise clauses of either the United States or the Vermont Constitutions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Windham Superior Court (Vermont), which convicted him of second degree murder, felony murder, and grand larceny. Defendant argued that the felony murder statute,&nbsp;Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2301, violated due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 10 by relieving the prosecution of the burden to prove malice aforethought and premeditation beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted on the theory that he robbed and killed a friend, stole his truck, hid the body, and went to Massachusetts, where the police recovered evidence pursuant to a search warrant. On appeal, the court held that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2301 made &quot;murder&quot; not merely a &quot;killing,&quot; during perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate arson, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, robbery, or burglary, but murder in the first degree, so that the burden remained on the prosecution to prove malice beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also found that premeditation was not a required element of the offense and that the statute categorized the degrees for punishment purposes. The court found that a &quot;clerk, pro tempore&quot; was authorized to issue a search warrant under Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 218, &sect; 33 (1981). The court ruled that hearsay was admissible in a warrant affidavit so long as a neutral and detached issuer used common sense to find probable cause from the totality of the circumstances. The court found that defendant waived the use of robbery evidence by a failure to object and that there was no plain error in giving an instruction that had since been rejected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner town appealed a decision of the Vermont Public Service Board which denied the town's petition to condemn under Vt.

The town brought its petition after a favorable town vote in accordance with the General Municipal Plant Enabling Act, Vt. Stat.

Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 249, giving the Board jurisdiction to establish and alter utility service territories, derogated from the otherwise unrestricted right accorded municipalities by Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &sect;&sect; 2901-2923 to establish electric utilities, and subjected such undertakings to Board veto, should it determine that the establishment was not consistent with the general good of Vermont. The Board held that the town's establishment of the utility was not consistent with the general good. The court held that: (1) Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &sect;&sect; 2901-2923 and Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &sect; 249 were not in conflict; and (2) the right and power to determine the establishment of a municipal electric utility were granted exclusively to the voters of a municipality, as long as the provisions of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 30, &sect;&sect; 2901-2923 were duly complied with, and the Board was without jurisdiction either to review or deny such determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff driver sought review of a decision from the Washington Superior Court (Vermont), which granted the motion for summary judgment submitted by defendant, the Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles, in an action to challenge the revocation of the driver's motor vehicle operator's license pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1205(f) on the grounds of three alleged &quot;refusals&quot; to submit to breath tests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver had been convicted twice before of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. When asked to submit to a preliminary alcohol field test on the third occasion that defendant was stopped on suspicion of driving while under the influence, he declined. When presented with two other opportunities to perform the test, defendant still declined to take the test, even though he was informed that his refusal to do so could result in the loss of his operator's license. On review, the court initially held that the six-year revocation of his license did not constitute a retroactive application of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 23, &sect; 1205(j). In affirming, the court found that the statute's enactment had no impact whatsoever on the driver's prior convictions, absent some new act by the driver which triggered the statute's rule. Moreover, once a court found that there was a reasonable basis for the request to submit to a breath test, the ensuing license revocation was accomplished purely by administrative action. Thus, the Commissioner's decision to impose a six-year revocation was not bound by the district court's evidentiary finding as to the first-refusal offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 2242 required a license to operate a junkyard, and Vt. Stat.

The trial court found that the automobile graveyard owner had a junkyard on his property, that it was visible from two highways, and that he had failed to comply with the statutory requirements. The trial court determined, however, that the facts were not sufficient to establish that the automobile graveyard owner was in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect;&sect; 2242, 2257. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision for a different reason. The court found that the Vermont Legislature intended that the licensing and screening requirements apply only to persons engaged in the active operation of a junkyard business. The court noted that legislatures rarely required licensing of activities conducted on one's premises unless such person was engaging in some business or profession. The court determined that, since Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect;&sect; 2242, 2257 applied only to junkyard business, and since the automobile graveyard owner was not engaged in the junkyard business, the automobile graveyard owner did not violate the statutes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The scrupulous conduct involved a side deal executed by the realtors that was designed to circumvent a buyer's inability to qualify for a low interest loan.

Appellants contended inter alia that their notices were unconstitutionally vague, that they were entitled to two hearings, and that there was no evidence to support a finding of vicarious liability. The court ruled that the findings were proper. The court held that: (1) the notice of hearing mailed to appellants was not vague where they were notified of the time, date, and place of hearing, along with the statutory violations alleged; (2) Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 3, &sect; 814(c) did not entitle appellants to two hearings, but only one; (3) the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the broker was vicariously liable for the realtors' conduct because the named broker was the corporation's principal broker under its real estate license, therefore, he was vicariously liable for the acts of his realtors.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 3846.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The town elected to permit the selectmen to enter into tax stabilization contracts with the owners of farmland without the requirement of a town vote, in accordance with &sect; 3846. When the town made its election, there was a requirement that farmers derive two-thirds of their income from farming in order to enter into a farmer's contract. The income criterion set by the town's selectmen included the income requirement. The legislature later removed the income requirement but the town retained it. The property owners owned farmland and sought a contract. After the contract was rejected because they did not meet the income criterion, the Board determined that the criterion was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that a town electing the selectmen method of issuing farmer's contracts had a wide latitude in setting the criteria. A town using the selectmen method was obligated to meet certain statutory requirements, such as the duration of the contracts, provisions pertaining to land use conversion, and a taxpayer appeal procedure. The court held that it was well within the bounds of &sect; 3846 for the town to use the income limitation, and the limitation was constitutionally sound.</SPAN></P>

The provisions of the codicil executed by the founder of the academy prohibited any bishop, priest, minister, or religious teacher from being trustee of the academy. The superior court reinstated the claimant to the board of trustees on the ground that he was unconstitutionally denied the position because of his religious preference. The academy and trustee appealed, and the claimant cross-appealed from the denial of attorney's fees. The court affirmed, holding that the codicil's religious requirement interfered with the substantial right to the free exercise of religion because it required the claimant either to abandon his faith or convert in order to participate in the administration of the academy. There was no showing by defendants that the claimant would not have obtained a seat on the board of trustees regardless of his religious preference.

The truckers challenged the constitutionality of the fees and the lower court found the fee system was constitutional. The court vacated that decision and remanded the matter for further factual findings. It found that in order to determine whether the fee system exacted unfair burdens or simply assessed a fair share of the tax cost, it was necessary to compare the costs imposed on foreign and domestic trucks in return for the services provided by Vermont. While the trial court purported to make the comparison, its findings were inadequate and contradictory. In addition, the findings did not address critical evidence presented in the record. Finally, without a comparison of the costs of the truckers with the costs of Vermont truck drivers, the court could not say whether the impact of the fee structure was discriminatory.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that it was are unable to determine from the findings whether the statutes imposing a fee system against the truckers was unconstitutionally discriminatory, vacated the judgment of the trial court upholding the fee system as constitutional, and remanded the matter for further factual findings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant made an interlocutory appeal from a denial by the District Court, Unit No. 5, Washington Circuit (Vermont), of his motion to dismiss the State's prosecution of defendant's violation of a city zoning ordinance. The ordinance prohibited projecting signs over a public right-of-way within the central business district, and provided for removal of all nonconforming signs within five years of November 6, 1973.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1970, with the city's permission, defendant erected a projecting sign on the face of the building in which his business was located. In 1973 the ordinance at issue was passed, and on July 14, 1980, defendant was notified by the city that he was in violation. He failed to remove the offending sign and was cited. Defendant argued that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it violated his rights to due process and equal protection, it was in conflict with Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, ch. 117, in effect when they were adopted in 1973, and it exceeded the municipality's authority. The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenges, but found merit in the argument that the ordinance was in conflict with Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 4408(c). That section provided that, while nonconforming uses could be amortized out of existence over a period of time, nonconforming structures were entitled to remain. There was no dispute that defendant's sign was in prior conformance. Therefore, the court held that the trial court should have dismissed the prosecution against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The claimant challenged the amount of workmen's compensation that he was awarded under the Vermont Workmen's Compensation Act, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 601-709 by the Commissioner. The claimant also contested the denial of vocational rehabilitation benefits. The superior court certified five questions to the court pursuant to Vt. R. App. P. 5(a). The court answered questions one, three and five in the affirmative, and questions two and four in the negative. The court held that it was correct for the Commissioner to rely upon Rule 10 of the Rules Pertaining to Workmen's Compensation and Occupational Diseases, and to evaluate disability without reference to the claimant's ability to work. The court held, however, that the Commissioner clearly erred in computing his impairment and in interpreting Rule 10(a)(3) because he referred to the &quot;whole man&quot; standard; the claimant's benefits should have been calculated on the basis of his back impairment. The court held that the Commissioner did not abuse his discretion in denying the claimant vocational rehabilitation benefits.</SPAN></P>

The press was granted permission to intervene for the sole purpose of being heard on its petition for access to any and all of the proceedings involving the juvenile. A second trial judge granted the petition and held that &sect; 651(c) violated the First Amendment. The second trial judge ordered the juvenile proceedings to be held in open court and that the public and the news media were permitted to attend. The issue was whether the First Amendment right of access to criminal trials extended to a juvenile proceeding to determine delinquency and treatment. The juvenile contended that &sect; 651(c) mandated that the juvenile proceedings be closed to the public and the news media and that closed proceedings were perfectly consistent with the United States and Vermont Constitutions. The court reversed and found that juvenile proceedings were not criminal prosecutions. Accordingly, the First Amendment did not apply and the public and press were not entitled to attend the proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The executrix's individual and estate claims against a tortfeasor's insurer were settled and the bulk of the settlement was paid outside of the estate. The court held that the trial court did not err when it found no contract liability on the part of the insurer and ordered the executrix to pay the center's bill. The executrix's refusal to grant the insurer an assignment of the estate's right of recovery, or to comply with the insurance contract constituted a breach of her duty as executrix. The center's lien was perfected prior to the husband's death, so the conditions of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 14, &sect; 1204(2) were satisfied, and the center was excused from any further presentation of the claim to the executrix.

Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 3255(a)(3) was a rape shield law that called for the application of the traditional test for legal relevance that past conduct was not admissible to prove present conduct, where the private character of the past sexual conduct was responsible for the harm that would result if the evidence were admitted. There were insufficient prior instances of the women participating in group sex to constitute a pattern, and the instances that did exist were not similar enough to the issue of the case, which was whether the women consented.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order from the District Court, Unit No. 2, Chittenden Circuit (Vermont), which found him guilty of sexual assault, in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 3252(3), and lewd and lascivious conduct, in violation of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 13, &sect; 2602, involving a seven-year-old boy with physical handicaps.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after the police were notified by a passerby of a possible sexual assault taking place several blocks away. At trial, the child, who suffered from a hearing deficiency, was unable to speak clearly, and could not read, testified that defendant fondled and kissed various parts of his body, and described various sexual activities performed by defendant. On appeal, the court found that the child's description of the alleged crime did not contain those elements necessary to assure accuracy. The res gestae exception did not apply because the child's statement came as a result of questioning by the policeman. The court held that its modification of the evidentiary rule dealing with prior consistent statements did not fall within the ex post facto ban. Defendant's request for dismissal as a result of delay was without merit. While in certain circumstances the words &quot;lascivious&quot; and &quot;lewd&quot; might have been too vague to have been applicable, it strained credibility to argue that the crimes charged were not sufficiently obvious so as to be legitimately proscribed. The jury on the evidence was justified in finding defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order finding defendant guilty of sexual assault and lewd and lascivious conduct.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that a final distribution decree by a probate court had the res judicata effect of a final judgment.

After the school districts sought to expel the children, the Commissioner sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction to bar the school districts from expelling the children. The school districts counterclaimed to recover tuition costs from the Commissioner. The superior court granted the Commissioner's motion for summary judgment on the counterclaim. The school districts appealed, contending that the Commissioner was required to pay for the tuition of the students and that Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 16, &sect; 824(a) violated the Proportional Contribution Clause (Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 9) of the Vermont Constitution because it cast a heavier fiscal burden on those communities with group homes.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer published a weekly publication that was mainly devoted to advertisements. The department determined that the publication was not exempt from sales taxes and imposed taxes on the ink, newsprint, and other supplies used in the publication. The court vacated the judgment of the lower court and reinstated the department's determination that the publication was subject to taxes. The court found that the publication was a newspaper because it was both periodic and of public interest. However, the court rejected the taxpayer's argument that the newspaper publication process was exempt from the sales and use tax. 32 Vt. Stat. Ann. &sect; 9741(14) provided for an exemption from taxes for tangible personal property which became an ingredient of tangible personal property for later sale. Thus, the exemption was conditioned on the ultimate sale of the product made from the goods sought to be exempted. The taxpayer did not sell its publication. Therefore the sale to the taxpayer of the ink and other supplies was the ultimate retail sale. Imposition of the tax was rationally related to the purpose of the sales tax in limiting multiple taxation.</SPAN></P>

The trial court reclassified the highway as requested. On appeal, the town claimed that the evidence did not support the result, and the road at issue could not be found to be identical to other town highways either classified or maintained as class 3. The court found that the trial court justified its reclassification on both discrimination and the compliance with statutory standards for reclassification, even in the absence of discrimination. The parties stipulated that the road at issue and other roads classified as class 3 had similar characteristics as to grade, ledge, and narrowness. The court found that discrimination in their maintenance was correctly inferred from these similarities and conceded unevenness of treatment.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 4470(a) and determined that plaintiff applicant was entitled to a zoning variance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the applicant had started to build a home, it was discovered that the home was only set back 13 feet, instead of the required 25 feet. The applicant sought a zoning variance, which was denied. The trial court found that the board's fact findings contained only conclusions reached by the majority of the board. It therefore ruled that the board had not complied with the mandate of Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 4470(a), which stated that the board should render its decision, including findings of fact within 45 days. Section 4470(a) also provided that if the requirements were not met, then the variance was deemed approved. The trial court approved the variance. On appeal, the board contended that the formal error of the conclusory statements should not undermine its decision and that the trial court erred in granting a variance. On appeal, the court held that &sect; 4470(a) required findings of fact, including reasons for the denial of the variance. Because the board failed to provide substantive findings of fact, it failed to comply with the statute. The court further found that it was not necessary for the trial court to approve the variance since it was approved by operation of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, town listers and tax collector, appealed from an order of the Windham Superior Court (Vermont) in favor of plaintiff boy scout council upholding a tax exemption claim with regard to the council's real property in the council's action for declaratory and injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendants began appraising a tax on timberland and wilderness land owned by the council in the town, the council filed a complaint seeking a declaration that all its land in the town was exempt from taxation pursuant to Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 3802(2) and an injunction preventing the levying and collecting of taxes on such property. The trial court entered judgment for the council and defendants appealed. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment in part. The court held that Vt. Const. art. 9 did not abridge the power of the legislature to declare what property should be exempt from taxation. Also, Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 32, &sect; 3802(2) did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the classification in &sect; 3802(2) was reasonable. The court found that the council satisfied their burden of showing that the use of the timberland was directly and substantially utilized in furtherance of its organizational purposes. The council demonstrated that it enhanced its ability to provide merit badge programs of an outpost camping nature. However, the council failed to satisfy is burden as to the wilderness because it failed to show its use of the land was substantial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court judgment's with respect to the wilderness lands and affirmed the trial court's order as to the timberland in the council's action for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants. However, the court held that the trial court could not grant relief beyond June of 1976.</SPAN></P>
