<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of aggravated rape in a trial in which he asserted that an alleged failure to distinguish the degree of criminality between aggravated rape and forcible rape rendered &sect; 14:42&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed that conviction, concluding that precedent established that a distinction was possible based on the degree of force that was used and the extent to which the victim resisted. The court also reasoned that there was a legislative intent to divide the continuum of acts of coerced sexual intercourse into two categories, aggravated rape and forcible rape, and to have the jury fix the range of permissible punishment for convicted offenders by returning a verdict that fit the crime and the degree of force that was used. The court further held that the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant raped the victim under circumstances where she resisted the act to the utmost, but her resistance was overcome by force, or that threats of great and immediate bodily harm that were sufficiently forceful to warrant punishment as aggravated rape rather than the lesser degree as forcible rape prevented her from resisting the act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The police found a motel room key on the victim's body. Their inquiry led them to a different motel room where defendant lived but was not present. They observed blood and shell casings and made a limited warrantless search of the room to determine whether anyone was present. Later defendant consented to a second search of his room. He was arrested and consented to the search of his vehicle, in which blood was found. He also made incriminating remarks during his interrogation. He urged that evidence, seized from his room and vehicle, was admitted in error, as the initial search was unconstitutional and he was intoxicated when he consented to the subsequent searches. The court affirmed the judgment of his conviction and sentence for second degree murder, as the initial warrantless search was valid as an emergency exception to the warrant requirement where the facts created the inference that an injured bleeding person was present in defendant's room. Further, defendant voluntarily consented to the subsequent searches. Although he had been drinking prior to giving his consent, he was given the Miranda warnings, he responded coherently to questions, and he signed the consent forms.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant city civil service commission applied for a writ of certiorari for review of a judgment by the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which affirmed the trial court's judgment ordering the commission to include respondent city firefighters' supplemental salaries, as provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2002, in overtime wage computations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission's pay plan did not include the state supplement in the base rate of pay. The court of appeal reasoned that &sect; 33:2002 took precedence over the commission's pay plan because of the plenary power reserved to the legislature under La. Const. art. VI, &sect; 14 with respect to minimum wages for firefighters. The court held that the legislature's plenary power to establish statewide rules for the measurement of firefighter's wages and working conditions was exclusive. The fire and police minimum wage provision of art. VI, &sect; 14 was not only an exception to the home-rule financial autonomy created by the remainder of the section, but was also a positive reaffirmance of the plenary power of the legislature to guarantee adequate fire and police protection for all citizens of Louisiana. Thus, the legislature's power to enact a law providing for &quot;minimum wages&quot; or &quot;working conditions&quot; for the firefighters was not limited by the commission's power to adopt a uniform pay plan, as provided by La. Const. art. X, &sect; 10. The court concluded that the commission was required by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:2004(D) to include the state supplements in calculating overtime pay for the firefighters.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments of the court of appeal and the trial court as amended to limit the order to the commission to revise its pay plan with consideration of the firefighters' minimum and supplemental wage laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant killed the victim by inflicting multiple stab wounds. Defendant was tried and found guilty of first degree murder. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence of death. The court held that defendant's conviction was not invalid on the grounds that defendant was illegally extradited from another state, because the extradition did not affect his trial or the conviction. The court also determined that defendant's right to a fair trial was not violated when the state discarded fingerprints lifted from the crime scene, because the destroyed evidence was not material and did not create a reasonable doubt that otherwise did not exist. In addition, the court observed that defendant was advised of his Miranda rights before making incriminating statements, and therefore the statements were correctly admitted at trial. Finally, the court concluded that defendant's sentence of death did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, and was not disproportionate to his offense, due to the murder being committed in an especially heinous manner. The court upheld defendant's conviction and denied his appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was a friend of defendant's girlfriend. The victim was beaten, scalded with hot water, raped, and set afire. She died several weeks later. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction with aggravated arson as an essential element of the offense of first-degree murder. Defendant poured, and then ignited, lighter fluid on a bed sheet and on the beaten victim, which created a foreseeable risk of endangering her life. In the penalty phrase of the trial, the jury relied on three aggravating circumstances to recommend the death penalty. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support its findings of aggravated arson and of the offense's cruel, atrocious, and heinous manner. Although defendant's indictment for an unrelated murder did not qualify as an aggravating circumstance, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.3 required the jury to find the existence of only one to recommend death. The court held that the evidence of defendant's prior unrelated conviction of involuntary manslaughter was properly admitted because of its relevancy to his character and did not constitute an arbitrary factor that improperly influenced the jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wrecked while fleeing from police after a robbery. Ballistics showed that a gun with his thumbprint on it found in his car was used in a similar robbery 18 days earlier where two workers were killed. The State did not have to notify defendant under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 727 that it would call the employer of defendant's wife to rebut, with the wife's timecard, testimony that defendant had taken her to work at the time of the murders. The wife's workplace was not listed in defendant's answer to the State's demand for notice of alibi or incorporated by the vague phrase &quot;either at or en route to&quot; the four listed locations. The workplace was contemporaneously added during defense testimony and subject to rebuttal. The rebuttal did not result in unwarranted prejudice. Defendant's hearsay objection to the timecard was not timely when made at the end of the employer's direct examination after the jury received the information by testimony. The records themselves did not prejudice defendant. Also, the employer's courtroom presence in violation of a sequestration order could not taint his testimony, which did not include any personal knowledge of the case.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction, arguing that he was insane at the time of the killing, he was denied effective assistance of counsel, his U.S. Const. amend. V against self-incrimination was violated, and he was denied a fair trial because a juror was acquainted with a witness. The court held that the evidence showed that defendant was mentally competent at the time of the killings, and that his right against self-incrimination was not violated when the court appointed physician testified as to his sanity. The court also determined that defendant's counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel, since counsel put on a vigorous defense. In addition, the court stated that a juror's acquaintance with a witness was harmless and did not deprive defendant of a fair trial. The court affirmed the conviction and death sentence, stating that it was in proportion to the crime.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, and held that defendant was properly convicted of murder and sentenced to death, because there were no reversible errors at trial, defendant was properly found to be sane at the time of the killing, and the death sentence was in proportion to his crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of second-degree murder. The First Judicial District, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana) sentenced defendant to life in prison at hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Defendant sought review of his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's wife was bludgeoned to death with a sledgehammer. Defendant claimed that he and his wife were asleep in their bedroom when they were attacked by one or two assailants. There was no sign of forced entry. Nothing of value was taken. Only defendant's print was found on the knife used to inflict defendant's minor wound. Blood spatters on defendant's tee shirt indicated that he had been standing two to four feet from the victim when she was beaten. An expert testified that the cast-off stains were consistent with what would be found on the person who had administered the beatings. On appeal, the court held that the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction because defendant's circumstantial theory of innocence was remote and inconsistent with the facts proven. A jury experiment on the coagulation of blood was not a radical departure from ordinary experience, was not essential part of the State's case, and did not deprive defendant of constitutional safeguards. Defendant was not entitled to question the jurors about their daily prayer services or about an alternate's discussion with a principle juror. The court rejected defendant's other assignments of error.</SPAN></P>

Defendant's major assertion on appeal was that the lower court erred when it denied his motion for a mistrial based on two questions by the State that made reference to a narcotics transaction. The court affirmed. The court held that the references to the narcotics transaction were not references to another crime committed or alleged to have been committed by defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Louisiana, which convicted him of committing two first-degree murders and sentenced him to life imprisonment, after denying defendant's motion to suppress his oral statement and his written statement and after denying his second motion to quash his arrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State dropped battery charges against defendant in exchange for testimony in another case. After the murders, defendant fled to California. Police were unable to retrieve him with a material witness warrant, so they revived the battery charge and gave him the choice of returning voluntarily as a material witness or facing extradition for aggravated battery. Upon his return, he was arrested as a material witness. He confessed the murders three weeks later. He argued that his statements should have been suppressed because his California arrest was illegal so that nothing he did after that was voluntary. On the record, defendant voluntarily waived formal arrest and extradition. Even if he felt compelled to return to Louisiana, it was not related to the murders. His material witness arrest upon his return and his murder arrest after his oral statement were legal. A causal connection between an illegal arrest and the evidence was needed for the exclusionary rule to apply. Defendant initiated the oral statement and was given Miranda warnings before his written statement. Three weeks was enough time for the taint of defendant's original seizure, if illegal, to have become attenuated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, defendant argued that the trial court erred in permitting introduction of a confession not disclosed in the State's response to a motion for discovery filed by the defendant. More particularly, the testimony was that of a witness who related a statement that defendant had made to him asserting that methamphetamine had been manufactured in defendant's lab. The court found that the testimony was in the form of an inculpatory statement, not a confession, and that the State had adequately given notice of such testimony. Moreover, because defendant failed to object to the State's response to his motion for discovery, to state clearly for the trial court his basis for complaint, and to request the granting of any of the remedies afforded by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 729.5 for failure to comply, he effectively waived his right to complain on appeal. Finally, the court stated that even if there was error, it was harmless given that the remaining evidence of guilt was overwhelming. Here, drugs and paraphernalia found on defendant's premises combined with defendant's admission that he manufactured the drugs constituted overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pleaded not guilty to all charges, but later pleaded not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. A trial date was fixed on the first degree murder counts with the State seeking the death penalty. On the day of trial, defendant withdrew his not guilty by reason of insanity plea to all charges. Prior to opening statements, defendant pleaded guilty to all charges with the understanding that the death penalty would not be imposed in the first degree murder counts. After waiving his right to all legal delays, defendant was sentenced to two life sentences for the first degree murder charges, 50 years for the attempted first degree murder charge, and 99 years for the armed robbery charge, all sentences to run consecutively. Defendant appealed. Defendant's convictions and sentences were affirmed. The court held that the consecutive sentences were not excessive due to defendant's unprovoked shooting spree resulting in the deaths of two innocent bystanders and the near death of a third, after which he robbed two persons at gunpoint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After finding her husband having intimate relations with another woman, defendant killed him. Prior to the shooting, defendant and her husband had a violent confrontation at their family home where the victim allegedly physically abused defendant. Defendant was charged with second degree murder, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1, but convicted of manslaughter. She sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that it had to reverse the conviction and sentence because defendant was erroneously denied the right to introduce admissible evidence in support of her claim of self-defense. The court ruled that when appreciable evidence was in the record relevantly tending to establish the overt act, the trial court could not exercise its discretion to infringe upon the fact-determination function of the jury by disbelieving this defense testimony and, thus, denying the accused a defense permitted her by law. The court concluded that in the absence of evidence of hostile demonstration or of overt act on the part of the person slain or injured, evidence of his dangerous character or of his threats against accused was not admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By way of an application for a writ of certiorari, third-party plaintiffs, several individuals and a newspaper, sought review of a decision of the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Vermilion Parish (Louisiana), which reversed a decision of the district court below and upheld the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:261E, which required them to furnish a bond for attorney's fees in a libel action brought by plaintiff lessee.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessee brought an action against the individuals and newspaper alleging libel. The individuals filed a third-party demand against third-party defendant, the lessee's attorneys and parish police jury, and against third-party defendant, the secretary/treasurer of the police jury. The secretary/treasurer and police jury filed a rule to require the individuals to furnish a bond for attorney's fees under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 42:261E and the individuals opposed the rule on the ground that &sect; 42:261E violated equal protection. The district court ordered the individuals to post the bond and they sought review. The appellate court reversed and declared &sect; 42:261E unconstitutional. The court found that the effect of the bond requirement was to create two classes of litigants indistinguishable from each other except that one was a private citizen and the other an elected official. As a result, the class of public officials was entitled to demand that a bond be furnished before litigation, which substantially burdened the right of some persons to be compensated for injuries, thus violating the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 (1974).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that portion of the judgment of the appellate court upholding the constitutionality of the statute and declared the statute unconstitutional, and rejected the demand of for bond for attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

The State applied for a writ of certiorari which the court granted treating the case as an appeal, and affirmed the decision. The court held that the term &quot;loiter&quot; did not have a precise meaning; not only was the word loiter imprecise, it also encompassed a wide range of innocent activities; there were too many versions of loitering for the term to define criminal conduct. Because the statute could be enforced against almost anyone or no one, &sect; 18:1462 A(2) was overbroad.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State and other defendants appealed from a ruling of the 18th Judicial District Court, Parish of Iberville (Louisiana), which declared La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:2488.61 B and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;13:2488.61 et seq. to be unconstitutional. A dispute as to the boundaries of a city was at issue in determining the jurisdictional limits of plaintiff city's court and whether two of its officials were authorized to serve as town and court officials.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city filed suits for writs of quo warranto against the judge and marshal of a city court requesting that they show by what authority they held their respective offices, claiming that the territorial jurisdiction of the court was the city limits, and that since the judge and marshal lived in an unincorporated area of the wards, they were not residing in the jurisdiction of the court and could not hold office. The trial court sustained exceptions of no right and no cause of action filed by the judge and marshal, and sustained the exception of the judge to the trial court's jurisdiction. The city appealed. The appeals court affirmed the exception of lack of jurisdiction and dismissed the appeal as to the judge and the exceptions of no right and no cause of action filed by the marshal. The marshal later filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment that the unincorporated areas of certain wards were within the city's limits under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction of conspiracy to commit aggravated arson, a violation of &sect; 14:26; 51 contending that the evidence was constitutionally insufficient to support a conviction, that the aggravated arson statute was unconstitutional; and that case precedent required that the offender must be present at the setting of the fire in order to be guilty of the crime of aggravated arson. The court affirmed the conviction. There was abundant evidence that defendant conspired with two other persons to fire bomb the house trailer in which his wife was residing with her parents and that defendant, although not present when the fire was set, knew that his wife and her parents resided in the trailer and that there was a good possibility they would be inside when the fire was set. The criminal code punished as aggravated arson the intentional setting fire to any structure or movable whereby a person of reasonable intelligence and perception would anticipate that human life might be endangered. These terms were not too vague to serve as a constitutionally adequate definition of a crime and there was no requirement that the offender be present at the time the fire was set.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which after a bench trial convicted him of purse snatching in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's purse, which was sitting between her legs in a stadium, was taken while she was watching a sporting event. After waiving a jury trial, defendant was convicted of purse snatching in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:65.1 for taking the purse. On appeal, he claimed that the evidence was insufficient to prove purse snatching and that the trial court erred in not reading a requested jury charge, but the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court held that &quot;snatching&quot; as contemplated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:65.1 did not require an actual face-to-face confrontation and was distinguished from &quot;use of force&quot; and &quot;intimidation&quot; by the very wording of the statute. Therefore, defendant's taking of the purse without force or confrontation still constituted purse snatching. The court also held that the trial court properly refused to give a requested charge because the requested charge inaccurately provided that purse snatching required either misappropriation with violence to the person or force directed against the person.</SPAN></P>

Ultimately, the driver of the car, defendant, crashed and killed two people. Defendant's blood alcohol level was 0.06 percent. He was convicted of negligent homicide. Inter alia, the supreme court held: (1) the allegedly inaccurate advice of possible additional consequences was not sufficient to require suppression of the intoximeter test results, since the consent form correctly advised defendant that his license would be suspended if he refused and that his refusal would be used against him in court; (2) La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:661(C) did not require a warning advising of the consequences of submission to the test; (3) it was not error to admit radar evidence of the speed of the car, since an adequate foundation was laid; (4) it was not error to deny the motion for mistrial when the officer said defendant had resisted arrest, since the statement was an explanation of the decision to handcuff defendant; and (5) it was not error to allow the officer to testify on redirect examination that alcohol contributed to the accident, since defense counsel tried to get the officer to say that defendant did not appear intoxicated.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two defendants were charged with traffic offenses, including a second offense driving while under the influence, and their cases were assigned to a city court judge who was appointed, pursuant to La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 4865, to try cases while a judge who was elected as a city court judge was temporarily absent. Defendants claimed that the judge who was assigned to try their case was appointed illegally because art. 4865 contravened La. Const. art. V, &sect; 22 (1974), and they objected to trial before that judge. The state supreme court held that the rights and powers of a judge de facto could only be inquired into by a suit in which the judge was a party, i.e., by quo warranto in a suit brought by the State, and defendants were not allowed to make a collateral attack on the judge's authority while defending charges in his court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court, Parish of Bossier (Louisiana), challenging his conviction and sentence for distribution of methamphetamine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a judgment of acquittal. However, since the case was tried before a jury, the court was procedurally correct in denying defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal. Defendant also claimed that the State failed to prove an essential element of the crime, namely, that the methamphetamine that was the subject of the transaction was not proven to be of the type which had a stimulant effect on the nervous system, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:964(c). Defendant argued that the prosecution had to prove not only that the substance at issue was a methamphetamine, but also one that stimulated the central nervous system. At trial, a qualified expert in the field of chemistry testified that the powder in the plastic triangle was determined to contain the drug substance known as methamphetamine, and was listed under stimulants. No further clarification of the expert's opinion was sought by either the prosecuting attorney or defense counsel. Therefore, the jury could have concluded that the substance was the type of methamphetamine which was unlawful because it had an effect on the central nervous system.</SPAN></P>

The city appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City Court held that &sect; 3-7(B) was an unreasonable yoke on the balance of the public at large, an abuse of the police power, arbitrarily enforced against minorities, although defendant abandoned his claim of discriminatory enforcement, and that prosecution of all violations of the ordinance would result in a dry city, and the city couldn't go dry without a vote. The appeal of the unconstitutionality of the ordinance was an appeal of right under La. Const. art. 5, &sect; 5(D)(1). The supreme court, in reversing, agreed with the city that the ordinance had acceptable police power purposes, promoting and protecting the general welfare of the city's citizenry, by promoting public safety and community beautification. The ordinance described prohibited activities with reasonable clarity; it made it unlawful for any person to drink alcoholic beverages from open containers in or on any public street, sidewalk, park, playground, or any unenclosed public place within the city limits. It was clear that total public consumption would decrease, and the likelihood of discarded containers on the city's streets, sidewalks, parks, and other public places would be diminished.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court reversed the judgment, held that the ordinance was constitutional, and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined the power to revoke a teaching certificate was tantamount to the right of discharge. Thus, 1980 Acts 236, &sect; 1340(A) contravened the teacher tenure laws. It also found that a code of ethics was contrary to La. Const. art. 8, &sect; 3(A) and 1980 Acts 236, &sect; 5, because it infringed upon the exclusive right of those appointing teachers to remove and discipline them. The commission's powers to investigate grievances, conduct hearings, furnish findings of fact, and make recommendations to local boards concerning contracts, remedial programs, and revocation of certificates were upheld. The appellate court held the state board could still revoke a certificate obtained by fraud or misrepresentation. Decertification of an employed teacher on other grounds effectively discharged that teacher, in violation of La. Const. art. 8, &sect; 3(A). Thus, 1980 Acts 236, &sect; 1340(A) was unconstitutional insofar as it authorized the state board, upon recommendation of the commission, to revoke or suspend the certificate of a tenured teacher-employee for any reason other than obtaining the certificate through fraud or misrepresentation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the 11th Judicial District Court, Parish of DeSoto (Louisiana), which convicted him of simple burglary of an inhabited dwelling, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:62.2, and sentenced him to 10 years at hard labor, the first year to be served without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant attacked his sentence, arguing that it was excessive and was inadequately supported by reasons, as required by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1. The state supreme court concluded that the record &quot;clearly illumined&quot; the sentencing choice and that the sentence imposed was not excessive. Defendant had a long history of criminal involvement. Although the instant offense was the first to give rise to a felony conviction, the circumstances of the offense alone justified a severe sentence. Defendant and his accomplices burglarized a residence in order to obtain weapons, decidedly an aggravating factor. During the course of the burglary, the owner of the residence surprised the thieves, firing at least five times in their direction. Defendant's conduct thus provoked a life-threatening situation, one that he logically could have foreseen. Defendant's lack of responsibility or respect for the law was further demonstrated in his failure to cooperate with the probation officers in the preparation of his pre-sentence report, when such cooperation would have been definitely in his own best interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The alleged heir was purportedly born of an adulterous union between her mother and the decedent. The decedent was then married to another woman and had three legitimate children.

After issuing certiorari, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment and remanded the case to the trial court for a hearing on the exception of no right of action. The court held that the exception of prematurity was improperly granted because the alleged heir was permitted to seek recognition as an irregular heir of the decedent and claim an interest in the succession in a single action. However, the alleged heir's action did not plead a formal acknowledgment or subsequent marriage of her purported parents, or other proof of filiation other than her assertion that she was born of their union. The court stated that the alleged heir's allegations were insufficient to support a finding that she was an acknowledged illegitimate daughter of the decedent, and her action may be met with an exception of no right of action.</SPAN></P>

He took money and jewelry from the victim and raped his wife. Both victims were able to positively identify their attacker. Defendant was indicted and convicted of aggravated rape, aggravated burglary, and two counts of armed robbery. On appeal, the court affirmed. Two color photographs depicting a wound to the wife's head was properly admitted at trial. The photographs were not so gruesome that they would overwhelm reason and corroborated the testimony of the wife concerning the aggravated rape. They tended to prove that the wife resisted the rape but was overcome by force. The probative value of the photographs was greater than the possible prejudice that might have resulted from their display to the jury, and the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the introduction of the evidence. The presentence investigation report prepared on defendant revealed an extensive criminal record and no mitigating circumstances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by bill of information with criminal trespass in violation of Cameron Parish, La., Police Jury Ordinance 10-1-56, &sect; 44(A). A judge found him guilty and sentenced him to 15 days in jail. The sentence was suspended and defendant was placed on two years unsupervised probation. On appeal, the court reversed. The ordinance under which defendant was convicted was unconstitutionally vague. It did not define &quot;unenclosed land or waters,&quot; and that phrase did not have a generally accepted meaning. A person had to reason his own interpretation of what type of waters were &quot;unenclosed&quot; by reference to the type of waters he determined to be &quot;enclosed.&quot; The circuitous reasoning necessary to discern the possible meanings of the phrase &quot;unenclosed waters&quot; convinced the court that a person of ordinary intelligence who read the statute would not have been given fair notice of the conduct forbidden, nor did the ordinance provide a definition to clarify the ambiguity. The ordinance was vague as it was written and the court refused to furnish a definition of &quot;unenclosed&quot; to illuminate its ambiguous language because the police jury failed to provide one.</SPAN></P>

The officers seized the battery charger and upon determining that the charge was stolen defendant was charged. The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which granted defendant's motion to suppress the battery charger. The initial encounter between the couple and the officers was permissible in view of the unusual conduct that the couple exhibited. Defendant also stated that he borrowed the battery charger when questioned by the officers and evidence that an item belonged to a third party was significant in determining an inference of theft was reasonable. The officers, in confiscating the battery charger, picked the lesser intrusion on defendant's right to be let alone and seized the charger.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant truck driver was convicted in the Seventh Judicial District Court for the Parish of Concordia (Louisiana) of negligent homicide, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32. Thereafter, he was charged and sentenced under the Habitual Offender Act, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. On appeal, he argued, inter alia, that &sect; 14:32 was unconstitutional, the results of his blood alcohol test should have been suppressed, and his sentence was improper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant crossed the center line of a highway and hit an oncoming car, killing two persons. On appeal, the court held that, given that defendant was unconscious when the blood sample was taken, he could not have revoked the implied consent under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:661(B), so his rights were not violated in the taking of the sample. Given that under &sect; 14:32 violation of a statute raised only an inference of negligence, the burden of proof was not shifted to defendant, and &sect; 14:32 was not unconstitutional. Although a state trooper had not been presented as an expert yet testified as one, defendant had not objected, and the trooper had appropriate education and training and had been qualified as an expert in other trials. Even if a remark by the prosecutor in his closing was misleading, defendant did not object at the time, so he could not raise the issue for the first time on appeal. As to sentencing, because the judge's procedure had the effect of giving twice the longest possible sentence, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:1529.1(D) did not permit the procedure. Further, the judge erred in sentencing defendant as an habitual offender on each of the two counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions and the sentences of five years at hard labor on each count, the sentences to run consecutively.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the trial court (Louisiana) that convicted him of two counts of negligent homicide, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32, and sentenced him to consecutive terms of five years in prison on each count. Defendant was subsequently charged and sentenced under the Habitual Offender Law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1. Defendant was ordered to serve five additional years on each count for a total of 20 consecutive years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was intoxicated when he hit a car head-on and killed two people. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in failing to suppress his blood alcohol test results because he was not under arrest at the time of the test, he did not consent to the test, and he was in a hospital in another state when the test was administered. The court rejected that argument. Defendant was taken to the closest hospital and all Louisiana procedures for taking the sample under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:661(B) were utilized. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32 did not create an unconstitutional presumption that its violation constituted criminal negligence, nor did it unconstitutionally shift the State's burden of proof. The trial court erred in sentencing defendant. The trial court should have vacated the sentence already imposed on the conviction and sentenced defendant only under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(D). Only one of two counts of defendant's conviction imposed on the same day could be used in his sentencing under &sect; 15:529.1. Blood alcohol test results and evidence amply supported defendant's convictions. Other points of error were waived by defendant or rejected by the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's convictions and sentences for two counts of negligent homicide were affirmed. The sentences on the two habitual offender counts were vacated and set aside and the case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the city sent a bill to the board for expenses pursuant to &sect; 33:4714 (B) (1980), the board brought a declaratory judgment action in the trial court, seeking to have &sect; 33:4714, as amended by 1980 La. Acts 823, declared unconstitutional on the grounds that the statute provided for sharing of parish officers' expenses that was contrary to law. The trial court granted the relief, and the city sought review. The board argued that the statute was unconstitutional because it was not confined to one object and because the title of the act was not indicative of its multiple purposes. The court agreed and declared only &sect; 33:4714(B)&nbsp;unconstitutional. The court reasoned that under La. Const. art.

The principal assignments of error involved the denial of a motion for continuance and the denial of a motion for mistrial based on improper closing argument by the prosecutor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. He was ordered committed to a mental hospital pending a hearing on his capacity to stand trial, and prior to the trial, was sent back to the parish jail. He also was tried in another parish for kidnapping. His counsel requested a continuance, claiming that he had not had adequate time to prepare for trial because defendant was shuffled back and forth to the other parish and to the state hospital. The court found that, even if there had been a very short period of time between the notice of trial and the date of trial, trial counsel had been representing defendant for over a year prior to the trial and had made several court appearances in connection with the insanity defense. Therefore, trial counsel had only to subpoena the experts and their records in order to present the defense. Furthermore, defendant had not made any specific allegations of prejudice resulting from the denial of the continuance. In addition the court held that although some of the prosecutor's comments were improper, they had not influenced the jury and contributed to the verdict.

The Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) reversed, finding the Law manifestly unconstitutional, and remanded the suit. The court granted the business's petition for a writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hardware business contended that La. Rev. Stat.

Under the Law, drug and grocery stores could remain open on Sunday, even though they sold many of the things sold by the hardware business. The court disagreed with the appellate court that any discrimination inherent in the Law rendered the statute constitutionally infirm. The court noted that each of the exemptions in the Law was rationally related to the legitimate state interests of promoting health, recreation, and welfare, and of preventing unfair competition. The discrimination among types of businesses did not become invidious merely because the drug and grocery stores could also sell non-food and non-drug items.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted the mother of cruelty to a juvenile and the boyfriend of attempted cruelty to a juvenile. Both defendants appealed. Defendants contended, among other things, that the trial court erred in requiring defendants to elect either a judge or jury trial at the time of their arraignment, erred in allowing both defendants to be represented by one attorney, that the evidence did not support their convictions and the sentences imposed were too harsh. The court upheld the trial court's judgment. First, the court held that defendants elected a jury trial, did not file a motion for a bench trial and proceeded to their jury trial without objection, therefore the trial court did not err in requiring defendants to elect the type of trial they preferred. Secondly, no prejudice resulted to defendants by both defendants being represented by one attorney, thus the trial court did not err in failing to require separate counsel to represent each defendant. Lastly, the court held that the evidence sufficiently supported the contention that defendants physically abused a child and the sentences imposed were proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parish sought review of a judgment from the 22nd Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Tammany (Louisiana), which struck down a zoning ordinance and found that the ordinance was arbitrary and inconsistent with constitutional and legislative guidelines.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish had passed a zoning ordinance that created six land use districts in the parish. It classified most of the land in the parish as rural. The district court concluded that the failure to create distinct districts to segregate commercial, agricultural, industrial, and residential endeavors was contrary to constitutional and legislative requirements. The district court also found that the ordinance failed to establish a comprehensive plan. Because the ordinance was declared unconstitutional, the case went to the court on an appeal of right under La. Const. art. 5, &sect; 5(D)(1). The court reversed and rendered judgment for the parish. The court concluded that the ordinance was valid. The court held that the ordinance contained extensive objective criteria, and that the planning commission did not have unbridled discretion to control the development of the parish by granting or denying permits. Where the issuance of permits was an administrative function and a permit must issue as a matter of law once the listed requirements were satisfied. Consequently, all property located in the same district was entitled to the same rights and subject to the same restrictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment from the district court was reversed and a judgment upholding the validity of the ordinance was rendered for the parish.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother sought review of a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit (Louisiana), which vacated the juvenile court's ruling that decided that the mother was entitled to discovery from appellee State of Louisiana Office of Human Development (OHD) because of fundamental fairness. Appellant parents sought review of a judgment of the Juvenile Court, for the Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which quashed a deposition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court consolidated both cases on appeal to decide the issues of whether the OHD constituted a &quot;probation officer&quot; as that term was defined in La. Code Juv. Proc. Ann. art. 60 and whether the parents had a constitutional right to discover information in the case files of the OHD despite the prohibitions in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 46:56(A),(F). On appeal, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment in the mother's action because La. Code Juv. Proc. Ann. art. 13(18) defined &quot;Probation Officer&quot; as a representative of the agency providing supervision services to a court exercising juvenile jurisdiction and any person designated by the court to serve as the court's probation officer. The court concluded, therefore, that the OHD was a probation officer. The court further affirmed the quashing of the deposition of a social worker in the parents' action because a deposition was not a permissible method of discovery under La. Code Juv. Proc. Ann. art. 60. The court ruled that the parents were entitled to discovery of the OHD's case file because a parent's interest in a decision which could terminate his or her parental status was a commanding one.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the appellate court, reinstated the juvenile court's ruling, and remanded for further proceedings. The court affirmed the judgment of the juvenile court as to the deposition, but reversed and remanded as to the OHD's case file.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, the court granted defendants' motion for rehearing regarding the constitutionality of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967(E)-(G), which imposed increasingly heavy mandatory penalties for possession of large amounts of marijuana, cocaine, or their derivatives.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its original hearing, the court held that the penalty portions of &sect; 40:967, which imposed minimum fines without specifying maximum fines, offended the constitutional prohibition against excessive punishment. The remainder of the statute was valid. Defendants argued that &sect; 40:967(G)(2) violated Louisiana's constitutional separation of powers. Under &sect; 40:967(G)(2), the district attorney could move the sentencing court to reduce or suspend the sentence if defendant provided substantial assistance in the arrest or conviction of others. In its original decision, the court held the separation of powers issue was not violated because the sentencing court remained the ultimate decision-maker on whether to reduce or suspend the sentence, even though it was the district attorney that moved the beneficial sentencing. On rehearing, the court held that there was no exclusive authority in the district attorney to move the sentencing court for a suspended sentence, but that the sentencing court, sua sponte, or by motion of either the district attorney or the defendant, could consider such a sentencing option. Under this interpretation there was no violation of the separation of powers issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's ruling on the motion to quash was reversed and the case was remanded to the trial court.

Ann. &sect; 14:70.1 and both defendants possessed the requisite specific intent to defraud the State, and (3) &sect; 14:70.1 was not unconstitutionally vague in that defendants should have easily understood what constituted the presentment of a fraudulent claim to the State.</SPAN></P>

A companion case, which convicted him of aggravated rape, was consolidated with the case for purposes of review. The issue on appeal was whether defendant, a juvenile, could be tried as an adult because of amendments to the La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the district court lacked jurisdiction over him since the subject crimes were committed after the effective date of the constitutional amendment but prior to the adoption of enabling legislation. The court affirmed defendant's convictions and sentences. The court concluded that at the time of the criminal acts involved, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1570A(5) provided for the initiation of prosecution in the district court of juveniles, 15 years of age or older, charged with having committed a capital crime, or a crime defined by any law defining attempted aggravated rape. And La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.1 et seq., the Juvenile Transfer Act, provided that juvenile defendants, age 15 years or older, could be tried as adults in the district court provided the transfer proceedings were conducted in the juvenile court. The court found that neither of these statutes, which were enacted prior to the amendment, conflicted with the amendment. The court concluded that the amendment to La. Const. art. V, &sect; 19 did not abrogate the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 13:1570 and 1571.1 et seq., in effect on the date of the commission of the offenses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his wife perpetrated an armed robbery of a hair salon, during which defendant killed the salon receptionist with a point-blank shotgun blast. Defendant was tried first, and testified that he was intoxicated and that the shooting was accidental. His request for use immunity for his wife's testimony was denied. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found no basis for judicial imposition of immunity. The court held that evidence of the effects of the shotgun blast were relevant to specific intent to kill, rather than to show that the killing was &quot;heinous,&quot; thus, it was admissible in the guilt phase. The court held that in light of the admitted aggravated circumstance of armed robbery, it was not reversible error for the trial judge to exclude aggravating circumstances under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.4 from the jury charge defining first degree murder, or to exclude La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1(B) from the definition of second degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and erred in failing to appoint new counsel at the hearing on the motion to withdraw when one of the grounds asserted for withdrawal was that his attorney intimidated him into pleading guilty. The court rejected defendant's contentions and affirmed his conviction, finding that an examination of the record revealed a conscientious and meticulous effort on the part of the trial court to determine the voluntariness of defendant's plea and to explain the rights waived and the possible consequences of the plea. Further, the court found that defendant's assertions of misconduct by his attorney were nothing more than an attempt to delay his sentence. Based upon the overwhelming evidence of guilt and the voluntariness of defendant's guilty plea, the court concluded that appointment of new counsel appeared unnecessary. Finally, the court determined that in light of defendant's prior criminal record, the seriousness of the offense involved, and the fact that he escaped in order to avoid punishment, the sentence imposed was not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who performed deviate sexual acts with a nine-year old boy, was convicted of aggravated crime against nature on a minor. After denying defendant's motion to remand for a hearing on a motion for a new trial as untimely, the court rejected all of defendant's assignments of error. Although the trial court should have held a hearing on defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized from his home, the evidence was admissible and defendant failed to show prejudice resulting from the failure to hold a hearing. The trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the prosecutor to ask the victim leading questions, or by allowing the victim's grandfather to remain by him while he testified. Nor did the trial court abuse its discretion in refusing to sequester the jury, or in concluding that newly-discovered evidence would not have produced a different outcome at trial. Principles governing the admission of confessions into evidence did not apply to statements that defendant made to the victim and to a witness because they were not confessions, did not refer to the victim, were voluntary, and were not made to an officer of the state.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed the victim in a bar following an argument over money the victim allegedly owed defendant from a drug transaction. Defendant was originally given the death penalty, but after the death penalty provision of the first-degree murder statute was held unconstitutional, he was re-sentenced. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence arguing the evidence was insufficient to support a first-degree murder conviction and that the trial court erred by failing to list second-degree murder as a responsive verdict to the crime charged. The appellate court initially noted the State based its charge of first-degree murder on the theory that defendant was attempting an armed robbery at the time he shot and killed the victim. The appellate court held there was sufficient evidence to suggest defendant wanted to get his money back and facilitated that desire when he shot the victim, even if he did not rifle through his pockets looking for cash. The appellate court concluded defendant received a sentence commiserate with second-degree murder; therefore, the failure to list second-degree murder as a responsive verdict was not error.</SPAN></P>

The Nineteenth Judicial District Court, State of Louisiana, found &sect; 32:58&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague, and granted defendant's motion to quash and set aside the conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attack of vagueness was directed at the words &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;proper.&quot; The court found that the words &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;proper&quot; were used to describe the conduct of controlling a vehicle while operating it on a public road. The court further found that, clearly, a person of ordinary reasonable intelligence could be expected to know what was reasonable and proper in the control of his vehicle while operating it on a public road and conforming his conduct thereto. Thus, the words &quot;reasonable&quot; and &quot;proper&quot; were not vague when considered with the conduct they were used to describe. Hence, the statute provided fair notice of the prohibited conduct. Accordingly, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:58 was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

Defendant expressly conditioned his plea by reserving his right to appeal the issue of whether the trial court minutes showing his two prior guilty pleas to charges of driving while intoxicated (DWI) could have served as a valid predicate for the present charge. The court found that the misdemeanor guilty plea to defendant's first DWI offense was invalid because it did not show that he waived any constitutional right other than his right to counsel. The misdemeanor guilty plea was used as a basis for conversion of a subsequent misdemeanor DWI into a felony. Consequently, defendant's third DWI conviction and sentence were set aside because the invalid first DWI guilty plea conviction was an essential element thereof.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the denial of defendant's pro se application for a writ of habeas corpus from the First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), the court granted supervisory writs to review defendant's allegations that there was an unconstitutional jury instruction given in the trial and there was insufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of second degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During an argument with his girlfriend, defendant pulled a gun from his pocket and fired it. The bullet struck and killed the girlfriend's three year old daughter. Defendant contended he only meant to scare his girlfriend and the gun discharged accidentally. The jury found defendant guilty of second degree murder. Defendant argued the jury instruction which told the jury that &quot;a man is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his act&quot; was erroneous in light of recent holdings by the court and the United States Supreme Court. Under the rationale of the earlier cases, the instruction was problematic, but the court noted that defense counsel made no objection to the instruction at trial. The failure to object precluded defendant from raising the argument in a collateral proceeding or on appeal. Defendant argued the evidence was insufficient to support the second degree murder conviction. The court held that a rational trier of fact could conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant had the intent to kill or do great bodily harm. Defendant's conviction was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district court's denial of the writ was appropriate. Defendant's conviction of second degree murder and his sentence were affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to death. He appealed, assigning 27 errors as grounds for reversal of his conviction and sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court first rejected defendant's arguments pertaining to guilt. Turning to the sentence, it focused on two assignments of error. In one, defendant contended that the death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors, based on the prosecutor's rebuttal argument. Another assignment argued that the trial court gave an erroneous or misleading response to a mid-deliberation jury question. The court found that the prosecutor made explicit reference to the possibility of a pardon. Likewise, the judge gave a lengthy charge on the possibility of a pardon and commutation should defendant be given a life sentence. The court held that, in reviewing a capital case in which an offender's potential for future release had been interjected into the proceedings by the state or the trial court, it had to presume that a death sentence was imposed under the influence of an arbitrary factor, unless the record clearly indicated that the jury was properly informed of its duty and admonished to disregard the improper remark, and the record indicated that the jury heeded the admonition. In the instant case, the jury was not properly instructed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction was affirmed; but his sentence was vacated, and the case was remanded to the district court for the empanelling of a new jury for determining anew only the issue of penalty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by information with three counts of conducting a system of merchandising slots on a pyramid board by means of an endless chain without having first obtained a permit in writing from the Louisiana Securities Commission. Defendant filed a motion to quash, which was denied. Thereafter, defendant entered a plea of guilty, reserving his right to appeal the adverse ruling on his motion to quash. Defendant argued that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 51:361 and 362 were unconstitutional because they were overbroad and vague. Defendant claimed that the term &quot;system of merchandising&quot; was without well-defined meaning and that the definition of &quot;endless chain&quot; provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 51:361 was completely undecipherable. Although admittedly lacking clarity, &sect; 51:361 defined a chain distributor scheme as a sales device whereby a person making an investment was granted a license to recruit for profit one or more persons who were in turn also granted a license to recruit. Therefore, &sect; 51:361 was not unconstitutionally vague, but instead, it adequately apprised defendant of the nature of an &quot;endless chain&quot; system of merchandising.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was 20, and the victim was 12 at the time of the crime. Defendant's conduct caused harm to the victim, as she had an abortion, as well as mental and emotional difficulties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his aggravated kidnapping conviction from the Fifth Judicial District Court Parish of Richland, Louisiana, arguing error in denying a change venue under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although a few potential jurors testified that they had formed an opinion and it would take evidence to convince them otherwise, no juror testified that the defendant would be unable to get a fair trial. Three of the jurors had not heard of the crime which involved the kidnapping of police officers. While it was publicized that the officers were shot, the publicity was neither inflammatory nor sensational, and was limited. It was not error to deny a change venue under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 622. There was no evidence supplying reasonable grounds to believe that defendant was mentally defective so as to warrant a sanity commission under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 643 (1970). Testimony as to flight and capture was relevant under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:441 to the issue of guilt and identity, and was admissible. Defendant's disregard for the authority and lives of police officers suggested that security measures were in order. Defendant was handcuffed only on one occasion solely for purposes of transport to and from the courtroom. The possibility that several jurors may have seen defendant in handcuffs did not appear to have been so prejudicial as to warrant relief.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction, arguing that he did not receive a fair trial. The court held that the trial court did not err in failing to excuse jurors for cause, because its did not abuse its discretion in determining that the jurors could render a fair and impartial verdict. The court also determined that defendant was not entitled to notice of the state witnesses under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 727, because the statute was not intended to provide the disclosure of state's witnesses who could refute defendant's alibi. In addition, the court observed that the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence taken without a warrant, because the evidence was in plain view. Further, the court noted that the prosecutor did not commit misconduct during closing arguments and his statements were not prejudicial to defendant. Finally, the court concluded that defendant failed to prove that he was denied a trial by a fair cross-section of the community or that the jury instructions were erroneous or prejudicial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of armed robbery in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:64. He was adjudged a second offender pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:529.1(A)(1), and sentenced to 198 years at hard labor. In affirming the decision, the court held that there was no error in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant. Taken as a whole, the affidavit contained sufficient facts to support a reasonable determination that probable cause existed to search defendant's residence. Although the contents of the officers' conversation with defendant were not contained in the affidavit and could not provide probable cause, the remaining facts in the affidavit supported a reasonable belief that the items might be found at defendant's residence. The items sought, which were a handgun, clothing, money, and a money bag, were objects that one might expect to find at a person's residence. Finally, the single affidavit supported a search of both residences, under one or separate warrants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife obtained a Writ of Certiorari from the Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Orleans Parish, Louisiana to review a judgment that favored defendant husband. The lower appellate court affirmed a judgment of the trial court that held that rental property that the wife claimed was her separate property was community property, of which her interest was less than half.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife purchased some immovable property during the course of the marriage. The husband intervened in both the purchase offer and the act of sale by declaring that the property was his wife's separate property, purchased with her separate funds, and that the community which existed between them had no interest in the property. He further certified and that all payments due on the property would be paid by his wife with her separate funds. The trial court found that although the wife paid the down payment from separate funds, the monthly payments were made with rental collections that were community property. This made the property part of the community estate. The lower appellate court agreed, but it amended the judgment of the trial court to show that the wife owned less than half the property. On subsequent review, the court held that Louisiana does not recognized property that is paid for in part with separate funds and in part with community funds as mixed. Because the husband declared in the deed that the property belonged to his wife, it was hers. Further, the fruits of the separate property belonged to her separate estate, so she did not owe the husband anything.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower appellate court and found that the wife had proven that she had purchased the property with her separate funds.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Applicant Committee on Professional Responsibility of the Louisiana State Bar Association brought disciplinary proceedings against respondent attorney based on allegations that the attorney's convictions on five counts of violating and conspiring to violate the Travel Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1952, indicated that he lacked the moral fitness to practice law. The Committee requested an order of disbarment, suspension, or lesser disciplinary action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing, the commissioner appointed by the court recommended that the attorney be suspended from the practice of law for three months. The attorney concurred in the commissioner's recommendations. The Committee brought the disciplinary proceeding before the court. The Committee asserted that disbarment would not be inappropriate but that, at least, a suspension for a significant period was necessary. The court found that the offense in question, a felony that involved bribery of a corporate employee with the intent to induce him to steal valuable seismic exploration charts from his employer, trenched upon at least two basic precepts of the Code of Professional Responsibility, set forth at La. Code Prof. Resp. DR 1-102(A)(3) and (4), that an attorney shall not engage in illegal conduct that involved moral turpitude, or engage in conduct that involved dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. The court determined that suspension of the attorney from the practice of law for 18 months was warranted. The breach of professional conduct justified a substantial punishment to avoid deprecation of the offense and to provide a meaningful deterrent to other potential offenders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the suspension of the attorney from the practice of law for a period of 18 months. Because the court, in exercise of its discretion, refused to suspend the attorney from the practice of law during disciplinary proceedings, his suspension was ordered to commence upon the effective date of the finality of the decision. All costs were charged to the attorney.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, based on the record of defendant's prior convictions, the trial judge advised defendant of his confrontation rights, his right to trial by jury, and his privilege against self-incrimination, and defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights.Defendant alternatively argued that where two convictions were obtained by a guilty plea on the same day, they should have been treated as one conviction for the purpose of serving as a predicate to a multiple driving while intoxicated charge. The court held that it was the number of prior convictions, not their sequence, which determined the appropriate designation of a subsequent offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Tenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Natchitoches (Louisiana), entered after a jury trial, that convicted him of violating La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had previously been convicted of aggravated arson, aggravated burglary, and manslaughter, and had been pardoned by the governor for the crimes. During his second manslaughter trial, the prosecution was permitted to elicit from him an admission of the convictions, and the defense introduced evidence of the pardon. The trial judge refused to instruct the jury that the pardon reestablished defendant's credibility, but it charged the jury that it might consider the pardon to have that effect. The prosecution also called a sheriff from the county where the crime was committed but where defendant did not live to testify to his bad reputation for truthfulness. The court held that the trial court's evidentiary rulings were correct. A pardon for any other reason than subsequent proof of innocence did not obliterate the previous crimes. Defendant introduced no evidence that cast doubt on the validity of the convictions or explained the motive for the pardon. The crimes were therefore admissible. The sheriff was properly permitted to testify under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:479 because defendant had worked in the sheriff's county for three years and was well known there.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator juvenile sought review on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal, First Circuit, East Baton Rouge Parish (Louisiana), which affirmed the order of respondent juvenile judge, under La. Code Juv. Proc. Ann. art. 103, committing the juvenile to the Department of Corrections until his 18th birthday. The juvenile judge denied defense motions to, inter alia, suspend the effect of the judgment of disposition and set bail pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was adjudicated delinquent because he committed aggravated battery, in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34, when he was 16. He struck another boy in the face with a board, breaking the victim's jawbones. At the dispositional hearing, the juvenile judge ordered the juvenile's commitment to the Department of Corrections until his 18th birthday, pursuant to La. Code Juv. Proc. Ann. art. 103. The court of appeal affirmed the order, finding art. 103 to be a permissible legislative response to the mandate of La. Const. art. V, &sect; 19. The juvenile urged that his constitutional rights were violated by the order committing him to the Department of Corrections. The court affirmed the ruling of the juvenile judge, as La. Code Juv. Proc. Ann. art. 103 did not violate the Louisiana Constitution, nor did it abridge any federal constitutional guarantees. The court concluded that the juvenile's right to bail ended once the delinquency determination had been made. Thus, after the juvenile had been found to be delinquent, the constitutional protections that were required during the adjudicative stage of the juvenile delinquency proceeding were not operative.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the ruling of the juvenile judge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested based upon an affidavit of a Louisiana sheriff that he was wanted for the crime of theft by check in Texas. The affidavit recited that the sheriff's office had on file a warrant from Texas for the arrest of defendant. At a hearing, a Louisiana judge entered an order purporting to grant Texas 30 days in which to furnish extradition papers to the court, ostensibly under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 268. When the district attorney later attempted to present papers to the judge, defendant objected, on the ground that the 30-day period had expired. The Supreme Court initially thought that process was proper, but on rehearing found that the 30-day period under art. 268 did not come into play until after the extraditing state (Texas) first requested extradition, which in this case it had not done. Defendant had been arrested based on a Louisiana affidavit, and there had been probable cause to arrest him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As defendant apparently had not waived extradition, the case was remanded to the district court for a hearing to determine whether there was sufficient proof to entitle the State of Texas to extradite defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator union brought a writ of review to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal, Parish of St. Charles (Louisiana) regarding the transfer of contempt proceedings to a criminal docket in a labor dispute with respondent employer. The union argued that a party could obtain a trial by jury, in accordance with La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:848, when accused of indirect contempt of court for violation of an injunction issued in a labor dispute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During a strike at the employer's oil refinery, the trial court enjoined both the employer and the union from engaging in certain specified conduct. Three days later, the employer filed a motion for citation for contempt, alleging that the union had violated the preliminary injunction. The union moved to have the contempt proceedings transferred to the criminal docket and designated for trial by jury. The trial court granted the motion, and the employer filed an application for supervisory writs. The court of appeal reversed, and the union brought a writ of review. The court noted that the court of appeal had held that the unambiguous provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:848 were not applicable when serious acts or threats of violence, intimidation or coercion threatened public safety. The court of appeal remanded the matter for further proceedings on the civil docket. The court disagreed, holding that La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank prayed for judgment declaring La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6:852(C)&nbsp;unconstitutional as an improper delegation of legislative authority and revoking, vacating, and setting aside the disapproval of its request by the commissioner to open a branch office. The bank filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that &sect; 6:852 was unconstitutional. The district court found that &sect; 6:852 was unconstitutional. The court, however, did not set aside the commissioner's denial of the bank's application to open a branch office. On appeal to the supreme court, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that summary judgment was unauthorized because it neither granted nor denied any of the relief in whole or in part claimed by the moving party. The bank's use of the motion for summary judgment to obtain a ruling on its cause of action without seeking any part of the relief it claimed was an unauthorized use of a procedural vehicle.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment from the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which granted defendant's motion to quash a bill of information charging defendant with unauthorized use of a revoked access card in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67.3. Defendant alleged that the statutory language defining the crime was flawed by an unconstitutional presumption.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court agreed with defendant's argument and held that the presumption of &sect; 14:67.3(C) was unconstitutional. Because unauthorized use of an access card was a specific intent crime, the court found that the mailing requirement and five day waiting period, which was incorporated in &sect; 14:67.3(C), indicated an apparent legislative attempt to impute knowledge of revocation to a cardholder so that a future use of the card could be construed as use with the intent to defraud. Although the court found that mailing, the passage of five days, and the use of an access card would be relevant evidence to show that a person received notice of revocation but nevertheless used the card with the intent to defraud, the court concluded that such evidence was not indicative of notice and fraudulent use beyond a reasonable doubt. Although the court held that the presumption was unconstitutional, the court nevertheless reversed the judgment. The court concluded that the unconstitutionality of one portion of &sect; 14:67.3 did not necessarily render the entire statute unenforceable. The court remanded for further proceedings on the severable constitutional portions of &sect; 14:67.3.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction in the trial court of the offense of unauthorized use of a moveable when he failed to continue rental payments on the television, failed to return the television to the store, or failed to notify the store of his change of address. The court reversed and remanded, and noted that the contract between defendant and store provided that if defendant made all the required rental payment, the store would then transfer ownership of the television to him at the end of the rental period. The court also noted that defendant repeatedly failed to keep his promises to make all the required payments, which resulted in charges being brought against him. The court determined that the charge of unauthorized use of a moveable required defendant to both take and keep the television without the store's consent, or by means of fraudulent practices, although with no intent to permanently deprive the store of its property. The court rejected the state's position that defendant's mere failure to make rental payments as agreed constituted &quot;use without consent&quot; or &quot;a use by fraudulent practices&quot; under the provisions of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, whose income was limited, asked her grocer to allow her to buy groceries on a credit basis. The grocer claimed that he denied her credit, but he did agree to supply groceries to her in exchange for her checks written for each purchase, which he would hold and return to her upon her payment at the end of each month. He told her that if she did not pay, he would process her checks and exercise his right to file criminal charges against her. Defendant purchased groceries in this way for several months until she failed to pay a monthly bill and the grocer filed criminal charges. The court held that the evidence was insufficient to convince a rational trier of fact that defendant had issued worthless checks. By its express terms, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:71 did not apply to open accounts, and the court held that the arrangement between defendant and the grocer was a credit transaction to be classified as an open account.

Defendant argued, among other things, that it was error to deny his motion to suppress evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was employed as a store security guard. Another security guard at the store began to suspect defendant was shoplifting because defendant always left at the end of his shift with a full bag. The security guard decided to test his suspicions and he asked to search defendant's bag. Defendant refused and attempted to leave the store without success. When the security guard attempted to wrest the bag from defendant, the bag fell to the floor and merchandise from the store fell out of the bag. Defendant was subsequently convicted of theft. The court affirmed. Specifically, the court held that it was not error to deny defendant's motion to suppress because the security guard's detention of defendant was valid under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 215 where the security guard had reasonable cause to suspect defendant of shoplifting. Furthermore, the court found that the security guard's use of force in detaining defendant and wresting the bag from him was reasonable and legally justified.

Defendant was charged with attempted first degree murder, and because the jury was unable to reach a conclusion on the robbery charge, a mistrial on that charge was declared. The jury convicted defendant of second degree murder. The court held that because the bill of information contained the combined charges of armed robbery and attempted second degree murder, defendant was fully notified of every element of attempted second degree murder and was thoroughly informed of the charges against him. The court rejected defendant's assertion that one element of the crime of felony murder, the armed robbery, was not proved and held that there was no evidence that the jury failed to return a verdict because it had reasonable doubt about defendant's guilt regarding that charge.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff victim sought recovery for damages allegedly caused by the negligence of a deputy sheriff employed by defendant sheriff's office in the operation of an official vehicle while on duty. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, Louisiana, affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the sheriff from the action on an exception of no cause of action. The victim appealed, and certiorari review was granted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The reviewing court determined that the sheriff was the appropriate governmental entity on which to place responsibility for the torts of the deputy sheriff. However, in the employment relationship that gave rise to delictual responsibility, the sheriff acted solely in his official capacity and could not reasonably be viewed as acting in a personal capacity in the employment relationship. The sheriff, as an employer, was to be held vicariously liable for the torts of his employee. The sheriff was liable only because he was sheriff and was only liable to the extent that he held that office. The sheriff was not liable personally, and the public funds to be used to compensate victims of the torts committed by sheriff's deputies were the public funds controlled by the deputy's employer. The appellate court ruled that that La. Code Civ. Proc. Ann. art. 2320 imposed liability on the sheriff, in his official capacity as employer of his deputy, for the deputy's torts in the course and scope of employment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal to the Louisiana Supreme Court, defendant's first degree murder convictions were affirmed, but his death sentence was reversed because of a procedural error which occurred during the penalty hearing, and remanded for resentencing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In the instant appeal, defendant argued that his death sentences were based on both procedural and substantive errors and sought to obtain a new trial. Notably, the Louisiana Supreme Court found, inter alia, that the jury's findings that the homicides were committed in an especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner, under La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 905.4(g), was of questionable constitutional validity as the jury was not instructed on the proper, narrow construction of the statute. To this end, there was no evidence that the male victim was subjected to any serious physical abuse (unlike, the female victim, he was not raped), and the evidence did not support a finding that the female was a victim of torture or the pitiless infliction of unnecessary pain (both victims were shot in the head, lying face down). However, where the evidence was sufficient to support four out of the five aggravating circumstances listed, the court held that the failure of one aggravating circumstance did not so taint the proceedings as to invalidate the other aggravating circumstances found or the sentence of death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District Court, Parish of Bossier (Louisiana), denied defendant's motion to suppress inculpatory statements, defendant entered a guilty plea to attempted aggravated rape. The trial judge sentenced him to 40 years at hard labor. Defendant reserved the right to appeal the adverse ruling on the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that en route to the sheriff's office he was threatened and received promises of a reduced charge from a deputy which induced him to make the inculpatory statements. Only the deputy sheriff and defendant were present at the time that the conversation took place so the trial judge had to decide the suppression matter based upon his assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. Defendant signed a Miranda rights waiver card. He was a high school graduate. He had telephoned and talked with his parents before leaving his apartment for the ride with the deputy. Defendant had received his Miranda rights when he had been arrested before. The deputy did not specifically admonish defendant that he could make no promises. The deputy's comment to the effect that defendant would be better off if he cooperated was not found to be a promise or inducement designed to extract a confession. The supreme court found that the trial judge ruled correctly when he denied the motion to suppress. The supreme court also saw no due process error in defendant's appeal being heard by a seven member panel comprised of four supreme court justices and three court of appeal judges.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company filed a petition for a temporary restraining order against the union.

The union filed a motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order and requested damages, alleging that the order was wrongfully issued. The court denied the motion to dissolve and granted a preliminary injunction. The court of appeal affirmed. On review, the court reversed and remanded the case. The court held that the Little Norris-LaGuardia Act, La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC), sought review of a decision of the Civil District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which determined, inter alia, plaintiff, automobile dealership's application for relocation was wrongly denied under the regulatory scheme which MVC administered, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1251 et seq., and that the scheme was also violative of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dealership, already licensed, had sought a license to relocate its operations. It was denied by the MVC because the proposed new location was in &quot;close proximity&quot; to an existing dealership. After the dealership successfully challenged the MVC's denial, the MVC appealed to the Louisiana Supreme Court which affirmed the lower court only insofar as it held that the license application of dealership should have been granted by the MVC; in all other respects, the judgment was vacated. Notably, the court held that when an applicant met the general standards established by law, the application had to be denied on the grounds of &quot;public interest and public welfare&quot; only if an unfair practice or a &quot;disruption of the system of distribution of motor vehicles to the public&quot; were involved. Since the MVC found that the conditions of the regulatory scheme, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1254(B) had been satisfied, the dealership was entitled a license upon paying the license fees imposed by law. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1254(C), (E). Further, the state's licensing scheme constituted &quot;state action&quot; for the purposes of immunity under the Sherman Act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision of the state district court was affirmed only insofar as it held that the license application of the dealership should have been granted by the MVC; in all other respects, the judgment was vacated, as the Louisiana Supreme Court had pretermitted discussion of the constitutionality of the affected statutes and found that Louisiana's regulatory law governing automobile dealerships was exempt from the provisions of the Sherman Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged by grand jury indictment with the aggravated rape of a 10-year-old girl. Following a jury trial in the Thirty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of St. Bernard (Louisiana), defendant was found guilty as charged. The mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence was imposed. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant brought 35 assignments of error, which the court rejected as meritless. Specifically, he argued that the verdict was contrary to the law and evidence for lack of proof of vaginal penetration. But under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:41 the State only had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the element of sexual penetration, however slight. Based on the victim's description of the physical contact between defendant and herself, the jury rationally concluded there was sexual penetration, however slight. The evidence was sufficient to support the requisite finding of sexual penetration. Defendant also complained that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to a State witness testifying as to a statement the victim made to her several hours after the rape. But the trial court properly allowed the statement to go before the jury as part of the res gestae. The victim was visibly upset and crying after the incident, and remained in the mobile home in close proximity to defendant. The victim's mother was the only other adult present, and she was in bed with defendant. Under the circumstances the victim made her statement at the first reasonable opportunity the next morning.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, contending, in part, that the trial court erred in: (1) permitting the state to amend the bill of information without a formal order by the trial court; (2) admitting certain evidence; and (3) denying his motion for a directed verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the theft of a compressor, on or about October 25, 1977.

The person who took the compressor in for repair testified that he purchased the compressor from defendant around November 1, 1977. This was corroborated by other state witnesses who testified that defendant was in possession of the compressor in late October 1977. The appellate court held: (1) defendant was not found guilty on the basis of an alleged improper presumption, but on the basis of the overwhelming evidence against him; (2) a proper foundation was laid for the introduction of photographs of the compressor, where the salesman and an employee testified to their accuracy; (3) as to a receipt and a bill of sale that was discovered just before trial and not turned over to defendant pursuant to a discovery order, the trial court properly allowed the State to use that evidence for the sole purpose of impeaching defendant's credibility; and (4) as to the latter evidence, defendant was not prejudiced, as the trial court clearly did not consider the documents in rendering its decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted by a grand jury in the Thirteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Evangeline (Louisiana), for the first degree murder of a child. A jury of 12 found defendant guilty as charged and he was sentenced to life imprisonment without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence in accordance with the recommendation of the jury. Defendant appealed and asserted nine assignments of error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant lived with a woman and her three children. Defendant killed the woman's 2 1/2 year old son, placed his body in a box of trash, and dumped the box on the side of the road. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder. The state supreme court found that defendant's argument that the indictment should have been reduced to second degree murder was without merit because an aggravating circumstance was not an essential element of first degree murder at the time of the offense. Since the photographs of the dead child's body were not introduced at the guilt determination phase of the trial, defendant was not prejudiced by the pictures. The lack of sufficient specificity in calling to defendant's witness's attention the time, place, circumstances, and person to whom the alleged statement was made precluded defense counsel from introducing evidence of a prior inconsistent statement. The testimony of witnesses who saw defendant physically abuse the child was properly admissible to prove motive. If the jury assumed every fact to be proved that the evidence tended to prove, it would have been justified in concluding that every reasonable hypothesis of innocence had been excluded.</SPAN></P>

However, the court found that the offensive matter the business was being charged for was not identified by the State as hazardous waste. The Parish had authority to regulate the keeping and burning of other debris under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1236(31). In the absence of evidence that the debris disposed of by the business was classified as a hazardous waste, prosecution under the parish ordinance did not infringe on the State's area of authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bank argued the trial court declared unconstitutional a statute that was irrelevant to the proceedings. The bank contended the Louisiana Consumer Credit Law (CCL) had no applicability to a mobile home transaction, because the transaction was governed instead by the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Sales Finance Act (MVSFA). The appellate court initially noted the borrowers purchased a mobile home after signing both a promissory note and chattel mortgage that were later assigned to the bank. The appellate court held the transaction met the definition of a &quot;retail installment transaction&quot; made pursuant to the MVSFA and, as such, was specifically excluded from coverage under the CCL under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9:3512(4), 9:3516(11).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The officers' summary of a conversation with defendant which had taken place in the presence of the victim, the three defendants, and two other police officers in the lobby of a small motel, did not recite details of the conversation. The court granted writs of certiorari to review the correctness of the trial court's suppression of an alleged inculpatory statement made by defendant to a police officer without defendant being advised of the right to counsel afforded him by La.

The court noted that defendants were not arrested or physically detained during or after the conversation, but were given a summons to appear in municipal court. The court noted that defendants made no move or attempt to leave the motel lobby while the police officers were there. The court noted further that even if the stop was a detention under La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants allegedly violated La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:967(E) through (G). The legislature amended &sect; 40:967 to provide severe mandatory penalties for possession of large amounts of marijuana, cocaine or related substances. Defendants contended that sentences mandated by &sect;&sect; 40:967(E), (F) and (G) were unduly harsh and, therefore, constituted &quot;cruel and unusual&quot; punishment contrary to U.S. Const. amend. VIII, and &quot;cruel, excessive or unusual&quot; punishment contrary to La. Const. of 1974, art. I, &sect; 20. The court found that, in view of the gross social evil resulting from the increased trafficking in drugs in Louisiana, the punishment provided in &sect; 40:967 was, at least facially, not disproportionate to the offense. However, the court did find that the penal portion of the statute,&nbsp;&sect;&sect; 40:967(E) and (F), unconstitutionally provided for no maximum fine. The court further found that the provisions of &sect; 40:967(G)(2) could be met without defendants having necessarily to relinquish their Fifth Amendment rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the rulings of the trial court granting defendants' motions to quash, severed those portions of the statute that provided the minimum fine, permitted only that portion of the statute that provided for a term of imprisonment to remain, and remanded the cases for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three defendants sought review, by writ of certiorari, from a judgment of the 21st Judicial District Court in and for the Parish of Tangipahoa, State of Louisiana, which denied defendant one's release from rearrest, following his release and rearrest without a warrant, and denied defendant two and three's release from rearrest, following their release and rearrest on warrants issued on the basis as their initial arrests.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All three defendants were release from their initial arrests based on violations of the 72-hour requirement of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 230.1(A). On appeal, the court failed to find the existence of a warrant for the rearrest of defendant one because defendant one was rearrested without a warrant and, therefore, without a determination of probable cause. The court further found no evidence as to why the police could not have obtained a warrant prior to defendant one's rearrest. The court concluded that, under these circumstances, the rearrest of defendant one was simply an impermissible &quot;revolving door&quot; procedure. Regarding defendants two and three, the court found that the issuance of their rearrest warrants was based upon a valid complaint that a crime was committed, even though it was the same complaint as used for their initial arrest warrants. The court found no compelling reasons why rearrest under these circumstances was proscribed and, therefore, concluded that because of the issuance of the warrants, legal grounds existed for their rearrest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the trial court judgment, denying the defendant one's request for release from rearrest be rescinded and set aside. The court ordered defendant one released from custody without bail, but noted that the judgment did not preclude his arraignment and prosecution on the charge for which he was rearrested. The court affirmed the judgment denying the motion to quash the warrants for the rearrest of defendants two and three.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the crime of obliterating a serial number from a firearm. He filed a motion to quash, which the district court granted. The State appealed. The court reversed the conviction and remanded the matter. The court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:1788(B) clearly prescribed the act of obliterating a serial number, not mere possession of a firearm with an obliterated or altered serial number. Because it equated possession and obliteration, it required conviction upon a showing by the State that defendant possessed the defaced weapon at any time, unless, of course, defendant could have established his innocence. Because obliteration was the essence of the crime, possession of an unmarked firearm was deemed proof of guilt of the substantive offense, rather than proof of a mere element. As such, it threw the burden upon defendant to establish his innocence once the State proved the evidentiary fact of possession, which was unconstitutional. However, because the offensive provision could have been severed from the remainder of &sect; 14:1788, defendant could still be charged with the crime of obliterating a serial number; therefore, a remand of the case was in order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant had been arrest for driving while intoxicated in violation of La. Rev.

The court reversed the reversal of defendant's conviction because &sect; 14:98C was constitutional. The legislature amended the statute and added the words &quot;regardless of whether the second offense occurred before or after the first conviction&quot; after the opening words &quot;On a second conviction.&quot; This change merely provided for enhanced penalties on second conviction if the first conviction had already occurred. The statute's repudiation of the notion that the first conviction had to precede the commission of the second offense in order for enhanced penalties to be imposed did not make it an ex post fact law. What changed was that the person who had been accused of committing the first offense, was awaiting trial, and committed the second offense in the interim had the criminal intent to commit a crime for which he was exposed to enhance penalties if conviction of the first offense took place in the meantime.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants contended that the statutes denied them equal protection of the laws and that the entire statutory scheme of La.

The court concluded that defendants met the burden of proving that, due to the infirmities inherent in La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to overcrowding in the civil courts building, the mayor authorized the district court judges to assume full responsibility for determining the most effective utilization of the space assigned to courts and offices under the jurisdiction of the civil district court judicial expense fund.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans, Section F (Louisiana), which convicted him of first degree murder, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30, and sentenced him to death in conformity with Louisiana's capital sentencing procedure, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly entered the victim's bedroom window while she was asleep in bed with her two children, stabbed the victim to death, and stabbed her 11-year-old daughter, saying he would kill her. Both children identified defendant as the assailant and testified at trial. In oral arguments, the prosecutor implied that the victim would have identified defendant, and also referred to future appellate review. The jury initially announced a deadlock, but after being sent back to deliberate, found three aggravating factors and unanimously recommended death. On appeal the court affirmed, rejecting 37 assignments of error, and finding the sentence neither excessive nor disproportionate. The court held that neither La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14.30 nor La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905 et seq. violated defendant's due process rights, and that the prosecutor's remarks were improper, but not prejudicial. The court found implicit discretion under art. 905.8 for the trial judge to direct further deliberations. The court rejected the finding that the offense was &quot;especially heinous&quot; under art. 905.4, but ruled that the sentence could be affirmed based on the other aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged judgments of the Twenty-fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), entered after a joint trial, that convicted them of violating La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:69 by receiving stolen things after they sold a truck stolen in Tennessee to an undercover agent in Louisiana. One defendant was sentenced to hard labor for six years and the other to hard labor for three and one-half years.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied defendants' motion to quash based on alleged lack of jurisdiction and venue, their motions for acquittal alleging that the evidence was insufficient to convict them, and one defendant's motion to quash the information for a defect of form. The State's oral motion for a continuance was granted. On appeal, defendants contended that the motions were decided erroneously and that their sentences were excessive. The court affirmed the judgments. Defendants' handling of the truck in such a way as to hinder its discovery by its real owner constituted acts of concealment in Louisiana. The evidence that they knew the truck was stolen was sufficient to support their convictions. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting the continuance. The objection to the form of the information was waived because it was not raised at the arraignment. The trial judge's failure to explicitly apply the sentencing guidelines of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 894.1 in sentencing one of the defendants did not require resentencing because the guidelines were implicitly applied. The other defendant's sentence was neither severe nor grossly out of proportion to his crime.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgments that convicted and sentenced both defendants for receiving stolen things.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A creditor obtained a judgment against a debtor, but the debtor did not pay. During a judgment debtor examination, the creditor learned that the debtor owned property.

It held that the inspection of the debtor's property was permitted by arts. 2451 and 1462, and there was no unconstitutional infringement on the debtor's right to privacy. Because the creditor had the right to seize and appraise the property, it was not a substantial infringement to permit a limited inspection of the property. The debtor was free to seek any protective order from the district court establishing the scope of the inspection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that his arrest, which was made in his residence without a warrant, was illegal because there were no exigent circumstances. On this basis, defendant sought to suppress the following evidence obtained as a result of the illegal arrest. The court found that, under current law, the arrest would have been illegal. The court noted, however, that at the time of the arrest, La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 213 specifically authorized the arrest. The court found that the current laws did not apply retroactively, where the evidence was obtained in good faith and the deterrent function of the exclusionary rule would not be served. The court further found that defendant was not entitled to counsel at a lineup prior to indictment. The court was unable to make a determination as to the suggestiveness of the lineup. The court concluded that the record was insufficient to affirm the denial of the motions to suppress and remanded for retrial of the motions to suppress on the issues of probable cause to arrest, suggestiveness of the lineup, and independent sources for the out-of-court as well as the in-court identifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought certiorari review of a judgment from the Twenty-Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson (Louisiana), which denied defendant's motion to dismiss extradition proceedings initiated by the State of Texas on a charge of theft by check.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In its original opinion, the court dismissed the extradition proceedings after finding that Texas failed to furnish necessary and proper papers for the extradition of defendant within the 30-day period granted by the district court pursuant to La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 268. On rehearing, however, the court reversed its original order that discharged defendant from the extradition warrant. The court remanded the action to the district court for an extradition hearing. The court found that defendant's request for an extradition hearing, which was made one day after his arrest, and the district court's order granting Texas an &quot;additional&quot; 30-day period in which to furnish the necessary papers were unauthorized and ineffective because the extradition process had not yet begun. Defendant was arrested before the Governor of Texas requested extradition. Therefore, the court found that the district court's order attempted to set a time limitation on Texas rather than granting Texas a 30-day time extension as authorized by article 268. The court also reversed its original finding that there had been no probable cause to arrest defendant in Louisiana.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the close of defendant's trial for simple burglary the state requested a special charge to the jury that defendant's possession of stolen items gave rise to a presumption that he had committed the burglary.

On appeal the court held that the statute did not give rise to a presumption of burglary and reversed defendant's conviction. The court reasoned that because defendant's objection was timely, and even though his appeal was out of time, because the court had recently decided that the statute could not be constitutionally applied to presume burglary, defendant's conviction had not become final and was reviewable.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:34, and sentenced him to ten years at hard labor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly shot the victim in the forehead after his brother had beaten her. A nurse and officers testified that she told them that the brother beat her and defendant shot her. The victim testified that defendant often carried a pistol, and that the brother and defendant's wife made statements indicating that he had a gun at the time of the shooting. Defendant testified that he was elsewhere, and the brother testified that she had been shot in his car by an unknown assailant. An unsigned Miranda form was admitted into evidence. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that evidence of the victim's statements were admissible as res gestae or exited utterances, and that, along with her condition, they provided probable cause for defendant's warrantless arrest. The court ruled that the evidence of defendant's habit of carrying a gun and possession of one on the scene were relevant to his identity as the shooter, and outweighed potential prejudice. The court held that the form was admissible to rebut any inference raised by a defense reference to his nonchalance when arrested. Applying the Jackson standard, the court found the evidence sufficient for conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for murder from the 1st Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana). He argued that the trial court erred by effectively depriving him of the right to be present during trial and to confront the witnesses against him, the presumption of sanity was constitutionally defective, and the trial court gave erroneous instructions and definitions of insanity to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with murder, and he pled not guilty by reason of insanity. Yet a sanity commission found that defendant was competent to stand trial. Three days into trial, defense counsel moved for a re-examination of defendant's mental capacity, and the trial court declared a mistrial because defendant was incapable of assisting in his defense. Following re-evaluation, defendant stood for trial, but persistently interrupted the proceedings with pseudo-Biblical rhetoric and singing of the Star Spangled Banner. After numerous warnings, defendant was removed to another room where he could hear the proceedings. After continued outbursts and interruptions from the next room, defendant was bound and gagged. The trial court found him guilty of murder and recommended life imprisonment. Defendant appealed. The court held that in light of the innumerable interruptions of the trial court proceedings, defendant's arguments objecting to the measures taken by the trial court were without merit. As defendant had not proved insanity by a preponderance of the evidence, it was improper to set aside the verdict on the ground that defendant was insane when the offense was committed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Parish of Ouachita (Louisiana), which convicted her of cruelty to a juvenile in violation of La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's 18-month-old son suffered third degree burns from hot water in a bathtub. While at the hospital, defendant made certain inculpatory remarks to the physician, who examined her child, and to a police officer, who was investigating the case. Defendant contended that she was not advised of her rights prior to making these statements, and claimed that the statements were inadmissible. The court found that these admissions were exempt from the hearsay rule, pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:434, 449 et seq. The court found that the officer's efforts were purely investigatory and should not have placed defendant under apprehension that she was under any compulsion to remain with the officer and answer his questions. Therefore, the court concluded that it was not necessary for the officer to advise defendant of her rights. The court found that the absence of any burns on the child's hands, arms, or above his waist was consistent only with the child's being held in the hot water by another person. The court concluded that, under either a theory of intentional or accidental mistreatment, the state presented sufficient evidence of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

Upon the jury's recommendation, the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court, Parish of Washington, State of Louisiana sentenced defendant to life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant confronted his estranged girlfriend in a parking lot of a shopping center. When she refused to reconcile, he shot her five times. On appeal, the court noted that the definition of first-degree murder no longer included aggravating circumstances. A witness to the crime could testify no matter which definition of the offense was applicable. Thus, her testimony that others at present and at risk was admissible. The court held that defendant was not prejudiced by the use of a more exacting definition of the offense. Defendant's motion to suppress his confession was properly denied. The evidence that defendant was discussing the consequences of manslaughter with the officers was not hearsay but introduced to show that defendant was not intoxicated and had freely waived his Miranda rights. The court found that defendant's sentence was not excessive where the jury recommended life in prison rather than death and the district court had no discretion in the imposition of the sentence. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's verdict that defendant had specific intent, which was not impaired by his alleged intoxication to support his conviction for first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The night before the shooting, the victim threatened his sister with a gun. Although the victim returned to apologize, another argument resulted. Some witnesses claimed that the victim shot through the door of the apartment where defendant lived with the sister. The victim was shot outside. A friend of the victim's testified that defendant greeted the victim and then shot him. On appeal, the court found that there was no evidence that defendant's assigned counsel at his arraignment had not been admitted to the bar for five years. There was no showing that the grand jury selection system fostered discrimination. The court found that several of defendant's assignments of error concerning testimony were not preserved for appeal because no timely objection was made during trial. Defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied because the newly discovered evidence was not so material as to produce a different verdict. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant armed himself with a pistol, waited for the victim, and then shot him with specific intent to support his conviction for first-degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a co-worker and the co-worker's liability insurer, sought certiorari review of a judgment from the Louisiana Court of Appeal, Fourth Circuit, Parish of Jefferson, which reversed a trial court judgment sustaining defendants' exception of no cause of action to plaintiff garbage worker's tort suit. The trial court sustained the exception on the ground that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1032 provided the garbage worker's exclusive remedy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal held that in order to afford due process and equal protection of the laws, the worker's compensation statute,&nbsp;La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1032, as amended by 1976 La. Acts 147, must be interpreted to permit an employee the same remedy in tort against co-workers for negligently caused work-related injuries as the employee would have if injured by any other tortfeasor. The court reversed the judgment of the court of appeal, holding that the court of appeal's interpretation was erroneous. The court reinstated the judgment of the trial court. The court interpreted La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1032 to prevent an injured employee from seeking recovery in tort for a work-related injury negligently caused by his co-worker. The court rejected the worker's contention that an &quot;intentional act&quot; should be equated with a &quot;voluntary act.&quot; The court held that the worker's petition failed to state a cause of action because it did not claim that the co-worker intended the consequences of his acts or omissions. The court also held that &sect; 23:1032 did not violate the worker's constitutional rights because the exclusive remedy rule was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was involved in a riot that resulted in the serious bodily injury of a reporter and the deaths of two police officers and three demonstrators. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting defendant's argument that the bill of information did not charge a crime cognizable under Louisiana law. The court found that under the provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:329.7, anyone who participated in a riot was clearly guilty of a crime. Further, &quot;riot&quot; was defined in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:329.1 in such terms that a reasonable person would be able to understand the prohibited conduct. Defendant also argued a double jeopardy violation. Although the jury in defendant's first trial found him not guilty of inciting to riot, the court found that defendant was not charged with inciting to riot on remand. The court concluded that inciting to riot and participating in a riot were not the same offense. Defendant asserted that he left the scene before the injury and deaths occurred. Considering the definition of rioting in &sect; 14:329.1, the court found that leaving upon police request after having participated in a riot that resulted in deaths did not make defendant any less culpable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction because no witness saw defendant actually break the glass in the lounge's doors and all of the evidence was circumstantial in nature. Even though defendant had not raised this allegation of error in a motion for a new trial, the court considered the issue. The court concluded there was sufficient evidence in the record such that a rational trier of fact, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, could have found the essential elements of attempted simple burglary beyond a reasonable doubt. The record contained evidence showing that three witnesses saw defendant standing near a broken glass door after they heard the glass break. In addition to defendant's presence at the broken door, two witnesses testified that defendant tried to conceal himself behind a post and then broke out into a run when two people he knew approached him. Because there would be no apparent reason for defendant to tamper with the inside door bolt and break the glass, a rational trier of fact could also find that defendant had the requisite intent necessary for attempted simple burglary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not deny that he killed the victim, but he contended that he was not responsible for his act because he was insane at the time it was committed. He argued that the jury verdict was contrary to the law and the evidence because he established his insanity by a preponderance of the evidence and, therefore, the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. The court reversed defendant's sentence and conviction, finding that defendant's motion for a new trial should have been granted. The court found that Louisiana was one of 22 states that required a defendant to persuade the jury of his insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the court concluded that defendant established the affirmative defense of insanity by a preponderance of the evidence and that no rational fact finder could have found him sane on the record evidence. Finding that the jury's verdict of sanity was contrary to the preponderance of the evidence, the court remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the ordinance that defendants were convicted of violating defined the same offense as &sect; 14:62; (2) the fact that one provision was a city ordinance and the other a state statute did not defeat defendants' double jeopardy protection; (3) the city was authorized to enact the burglary ordinance by La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parish council refused to issue an ordinance of no objection to the lessee's construction of a processing unit on the landowner's property, which was located in a heavy industrial district. The landowner and the lessee filed a suit contending that the parish's failure to adopt the ordinance of no objection was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious and that Parish of Jefferson. La., Ordinance no. 14068 was unconstitutional. The district court declared that no. 14068 was unconstitutional and granted a writ of mandamus to compel issuance of a building permit. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court determined that no. 14068 was unconstitutional in the absence of any criteria for one petroleum facility to be approved and another disapproved. The court found that no. 14068 provided an exception for a particular category of heavy industry for no apparent reason, that it was devoid of any guidelines for its application, and that no policy was stated in the enactment. The court found that the parish council did not even indicate a minimal standard: that an ordinance of no objection would be approved if the proposed use did not present a hazard to the public.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

Defendant also contended that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for attempted simple rape. The court rejected this contention, finding that under the attempt statute,&nbsp;La.

Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in permitting a witness to testify, over objection, as to procedures within the state crime laboratory.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An undercover officer went to the local driver's license office posing as a seaman who did not speak English. The officer testified that he placed a landing permit, or seaman's pass, along with $ 30 on defendant's desk, that the defendant took the money, and, without any formality other than asking if he could drive a car and filling out the application, the defendant issued the officer a temporary driver's license. Defendant was convicted of public bribery. The court affirmed finding that even if the defendant had properly raised the defense of entrapment before the trial court, there was no evidence to support the allegation because the officer merely furnished the opportunity for the commission of the crime. The court held the officer's testimony was sufficient to support a finding that the defendant accepted something of value with the intent to influence his conduct in relation to his position, employment, or duty.

Stat. &sect; 14:95.1. Defendant had been previously convicted for simple burglary, on his plea of guilty. Defendant filed a motion to quash the information on the basis that the prior conviction did not comply with the standards of Boykin v. Alabama. The state argued that defendant had been informed of the privilege against self-incrimination, the right to trial by jury, and the right to confront his accusers, and that the plea was therefore intelligently and voluntarily made. The trial court granted defendant's motion, and the state sought certiorari review of the ruling. The court held that the colloquy conducted by the trial court in defendant's prior conviction adequately informed him of his privilege against self-incrimination when it informed him that by waiving his right to trial he also waived the right to remain silent.

The court found that &sect; 14:67.6 was not unconstitutional in that it failed to give notice regarding conduct proscribed and failed to set forth standards of guilt, as defendant claimed, because it clearly required the State to prove that defendant had obtained utility service without consent and with intent to defraud the company, either by preventing the meter from accurately measuring service or by diverting service. However, the court found that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67.6 B was unconstitutional because it had required defendant to prove that he was not responsible and that he was an innocent beneficiary thereby unconstitutionally allocating the burden of proof. The court found that the remainder of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67.6 was valid; therefore, the State was allowed to prosecute defendant under the constitutionally valid provision of La. Rev.

At issue was whether the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress physical evidence, a statement given to the police, and a one-on-one identification made by the victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was walking down the street. He seemed to notice two police officers in an unmarked car and started running. The police pursued him, jumped out of the car, and cornered him. Although defendant had his hands in plain view and made no reaching motions, the police frisked him and found a handgun. They contacted dispatch and learned that an armed robbery had taken place just a few blocks away. The police took defendant to the scene of the crime where he was positively identified by the victim. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress made on the basis that the stop and frisk was unconstitutional. Defendant was convicted of armed robbery. On appeal the court found that the high crime area, defendant's nervousness, and his attempt to flee provided reasonable grounds to justify a lawful investigatory stop. The court held the officers could have rightly feared the presence of a weapon when they stopped defendant by cornering him and identifying themselves as police officers. The court found that a visual search for a suspicious bulge would have been inadequate to ensure the officer's safety because defendant was wearing a leather jacket.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When defendant's husband learned of her plans to go out for the evening, he told her that he did not want her to leave the house. Witnesses testified that they saw defendant transfer a gun to her purse. A single shot was heard, and witnesses rushed into the bedroom in time to see the victim, defendant's husband, slumping across the bed. Defendant was standing at the foot of the bed with a gun in her hand. The victim was taken to a hospital where he died. On appeal from a conviction for manslaughter, the court affirmed. The court held that no prejudice to defendant resulted through the failure to charge the jury to ascertain whether the homicide was not aggravated. Defendant could not claim to be aggrieved by the omission, because she was convicted of the lesser offense of manslaughter rather than second degree murder. When the conduct constituting error did not fit within the mandatory mistrial provisions of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 770, the trial court was given discretion to determine whether defendant was so prejudiced that a fair trial was impossible. The remedy of mistrial was not justified when an admonition was sufficient to preserve defendant's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and noted that defendant asserted that the bill of information erroneously stated that she was a prior offender. The court held that because defendant was fairly informed of the nature of the charge and had not been prejudiced by surprise of lack of notice, she could not question the technical deficiencies in a bill of information. The court rejected defendant's assertion that there was insufficient evidence that she solicited money for sex because the police officer overheard her solicitation of an unknown male. The court held that there was no gender bias in the prostitution statute because the legislature could determine that male prostitution was not a serious social problem. The court held that defendant's exclusion from the French Quarter was not a restriction on her citizenship, and that the trial court was empowered under La. Code Crim. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant acquainted himself with the victim while she was working in a shop. At closing time, defendant started strangling the victim and ordered her to take off her clothes. He then required her to perform fellatio before raping her. Subsequently, defendant was convicted of a simple crime against nature and forcible rape. After a multiple offender hearing, defendant was sentenced to five years for the first crime and to 60 years for the latter. On appeal, defendant relied on numerous assignments of error. The court affirmed, finding that the trial court was correct in refusing to quash the indictment. Further, the court found that the State properly questioned the victim about the last time she had sexual relations with her husband because the rape shield law, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 15:498, only prohibited questions that impeached a victim's general reputation for chastity. Further, the court held that defendant entered his guilty plea knowingly where the Boykin requirements were met. The court also noted that a second multiple offender hearing did not place defendant in jeopardy because such a proceeding was not a trial on a criminal charge, but merely a part of sentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the trial court's judgment that held that the negligent injuring statute was unconstitutional on its face. The court reversed and noted that at issue was whether the statute infringed on defendant's constitutional right to remain silent and his presumption of innocence. The statute provided in part that the violation of a statute or ordinance should be considered only as presumptive evidence of such criminal negligence. The related issue was whether the statute relieved the state from its burden of proving every element of the crime by the elevation of non-negligent statutory violations or those indicative of ordinary negligence to the status of criminal negligence. The court found that under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:12, to constitute criminal negligence, defendant's conduct must have been a gross deviation below the standard expected of a reasonable man. The court held that the statute in question contained only a permissive presumption that permitted, but did not require, the fact finder to determine the existence of an element of the crime from one or more basic facts, did not shift any burdens or impact that standard of proof, and was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with criminal neglect of family in violation of La. Rev. Stat.

The trial court ruled to allow evidence that defendant was not the biological father of the child. On writ for review, the court reversed the ruling, holding that such evidence was inadmissible. Under former La. Civ.

The court noted that defendant failed to make a timely disavowal of paternity. The court further held that &quot;parent&quot; as contemplated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:74 included both legal and biological parents and that in the instant case legal parenthood could be established via proof that defendant was married to the mother at the time of the birth and that he failed to timely disavow the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers had information about a bank robbery and a description of the robber and his car.

Therefore, a suitcase near him and items inside it were properly admitted into evidence. As to defendant's motion to represent himself, the court held that, because he had not objected at the time nor reserved a bill of exceptions, under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 841 (later amended), he had preserved nothing for review. Likewise, the prosecutor's display of the gun was not reviewable. Because defendant had not requested processing of all investigatory photographs taken by police, that the State introduced only 6 photographs was not error. Defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied. Even though no one actually saw a gun and none was ever found, there was ample evidence to support the jury's conclusion that defendant was armed with a dangerous weapon at the time of the robbery.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state challenged the trial court's judgment that quashed the bill of information that charged defendants with &quot;unknowing&quot; possession of a dangerous controlled drug. The trial court declared the statute under which defendants were charged to have been unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded, and held that the portion of the statute that permitted defendants to have been charged with unknowing possession of Talwin to have been unconstitutional, but that the remainder of the statute was constitutional. The court noted defendants' assertion that the statute was overbroad in making unknowing possession of a drug a criminal offense. The court held that defendants had standing to make their challenge because there was more than a remote possibility that they would have been charged under the challenged provisions. The court then noted that intent was an indispensable element of a criminal offense, and determined that it was not difficult to envision a situation where a person would be accused with unknowing possession of a drug. The court held that such a situation offended the conscious, and that such possession could not be made criminal.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed defendant's conviction, but reversed and remanded his sentence of death. The court rejected as being without merit defendant's assertion that the trial court excluded the testimony of three witnesses as a sanction for his failure to make a pre-trial disclosure of their names as alibi witnesses. The court noted that defendant asserted that the trial court erred when it failed to instruct the jurors that if they were unable to reach a unanimous sentence recommendation, the trial court must impose a sentence of life imprisonment without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. The court held that by allowing the jury to remain ignorant of the true consequence of its failure to reach a unanimous recommendation of death or life imprisonment, the trial court failed to minimize the risk of an arbitrary and capricious decision.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. The conviction arose as the result of a murder of a security guard that was committed during the course of a bank robbery. On appeal, the court first found no merit in defendant's constitutional challenge to the jury challenges allowed the State under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 798. The court found that the State was entitled to exercise its peremptory challenges as it wished because defendant had failed to prove a systematic exclusion of blacks as alleged. The court found that the trial judge did not err in refusing defendant's request to charge the jury that the victim was not a peace officer engaged in his lawful duties because, contrary to defendant's contention, the deputy's presence and general activity at the bank on a paid detail was not the type of proscribed services of a law enforcement nature contemplated by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:140(3). Finally, the court found no indication that the sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factors. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' property was zoned single family residential. They sought to have the property rezoned so that they could build a mobile home park. The commission denied their request for rezoning, as did the city council. The owners then filed suit alleging that the city ordinance, which required them to obtain a trailer park permit before establishing a trailer park, was unconstitutional. The owners claimed that there were no objective standards for granting or denying the permit set forth in the ordinance. They also claimed that the city's refusal to rezone the property was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. The trial court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed and held that because the owners had never requested a permit and had not been denied a permit, they were in no position to claim prejudice resulting from the ordinance. The court concluded that the trial court had decided an issue that was not properly before it. The court also found that the trial court failed to address the owner's contention that the city violated the constitution when it denied the request for rezoning.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As defendant, who was driving north, was about to pass another car, which was traveling south, defendant's car suddenly went into a spin, crossed into the southbound lane of traffic, and collided head on with the other car. One of the passengers in the other car died as a result of her injuries. Approximately two hours after the accident, defendant consented to a blood test to determine the alcohol content of his blood, which was over 0.10 percent. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:662, a level of over 0.10 percent created a presumption that the person was under the influence of alcohol. On review, the court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that there was no impermissible linking of the presumption provided by &sect; 32:662 and that provided by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:32 concerning criminal negligence because the jury had been instructed that there was no presumption of criminal negligence in favor of the prosecution. The court also found that a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The utility and the cooperative both claimed the right to provide electric service to a homeowner. The utility filed a complaint before the Commission. The Commission denied the cooperative's arguments that the Commission lacked jurisdiction and ruled on the merits for the utility. On review, the court affirmed. The court rejected the cooperative's claim that the Commission lacked jurisdiction because the electric line that would have to be extended to provide the service was municipally owned, noting that the extension would belong to the utility, and its claim that 1978 La. Acts 77 removed electrical cooperatives from the jurisdiction of the Commission, finding that an exception allowed the Commission to retain jurisdiction over electric cooperatives in order to avoid the duplication of electric facilities. On the merits, the court held that the utility could provide electrical service to the residence economically and justifiably by the use of existing facilities and that the cooperative had not met its burden of showing that the Commission's decision was arbitrary or capricious or that a technical violation by the Commission of its rules warranted invalidation of its orders.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.1, to submit to a psychiatric and psychological examination for the purpose of evaluating defendant's amenability to the juvenile system.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been charged in juvenile court, and there had been neither an order of transfer nor an adjudication of delinquency. The examination was ordered over the objection of defendant. The court found the juvenile court's order to be correct. In order to transfer a child to adult court under &sect; 13:1571.1, the juvenile judge was required to find reasonable grounds to believe that the child was not amenable to treatment or rehabilitation through juvenile facilities. The court held that La. Code Juv. Proc. Ann. art. 61, which listed circumstances in which psychological evaluation could be ordered and when it must be requested by the child, did not apply to proceedings in which the child had been charged with a crime. However, the court also held that the legislature did not intend for art. 61 to prohibit a juvenile judge from obtaining psychological information when it would be of probative value in a juvenile transfer hearing. The court further held that ordering the hearing did not violate the child's constitutional rights against self-incrimination because the evaluation was not being conducted to determine the child's guilt or innocence of the crime charged.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, along with two other white men, were involved in brawl that led to the victim being stabbed to death. Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder in violation of La. Rev. Stat.

On appeal, defendant urged 11 assignments of error. The court held that defendant's assignments of error lacked merit. The court noted that the late disclosure of exculpatory evidence did not so prejudice defendant as to deprived him of his constitutional right to a fair trial. The court determined that defendant had ample opportunity to use the prior statement for impeachment purposes, and in fact did so in a thorough manner. The court further determined that defendant failed to show that any such exculpatory statements existed, or that any such statements were material to the case and exculpatory. The court found that it was not unduly prejudicial to defendant that, as an incident to a procedural colloquy between the court and the prosecutor, the jury's attention was attracted to a matter.</SPAN></P>

On a writ of certiorari, the court reversed the appellate court's judgment and reinstated the district court's judgment. The office of the coroner was established by La. Const. art. 5, &sect; 29 (1974) and was previously established by every Louisiana constitution since 1845. The parish had no power to abolish the office of coroner, and the coroner's duties and powers were set by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 33:1551 et seq. and La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 101 et seq., not by the parish's ordinances. Therefore, although the coroner's jurisdiction was limited to his parish, the coroner's office was an agency of the State.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An intestate decedent was survived by acknowledged illegitimate children and one adopted child, who had also been illegitimate. The trial court, applying La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 919, which excluded acknowledged illegitimates from participating in the succession of their father when he was survived by legitimate descendants, excluded the illegitimate children because of the existence of the adopted child. The appellate court reversed. The court held that art. 919 was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3 (1974).The statute was not substantially related to the state's interests in the promotion of legitimate family relationships, the possibilities which the father could have exercised to insure the illegitimates a part of the succession, and the orderly disposition of property at death. The distinction drawn by art. 919 between acknowledged illegitimates and all other relations was arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable. Absent any legislative authority to remedy their loss of succession rights as the children of their father, art. 919 denied the illegitimate children equal protection.</SPAN></P>

Therefore, the court concluded that the statute did not place the public on notice of the type of dancing that was prohibited. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

He also alleged that his plea was involuntary because it was induced in part by the State's promise that he would receive no jail term and that the plea bargain was breached by imposition of the five-year sentence. Further, defendant alleged that the trial judge erred in not providing him with a copy of a pre-sentence report. The court vacated defendant's sentence on grounds that the trial judge failed to cite any factual reasons for his conclusion that there was an undue risk that defendant would commit another crime if granted probation, and that a lesser sentence would depreciate the seriousness of the crime. The court further noted that in considering mitigating circumstances, the trial judge continued to give unexplained findings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State brought charges of obscenity against five booksellers, seeking a declaration that a magazine, which they sold, was obscene. The booksellers removed the magazine from their stores, but the publisher intervened. The trial court found that the magazine was obscene. The publisher brought a writ of certiorari, and the court held that the magazine was not obscene. It determined that the magazine, taken as a whole, did not lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. While the State proved that the magazine appealed to prurient interests and depicted or described in a patently offensive way, hard core sexual conduct, it did not meet the final prong of the test. The court found that the articles were not a sham. The magazine's subject matter was important and current.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged his conviction and sentence from the District Court for the Parish of Orleans (Louisiana) for the crime of attempted armed robbery. The issue on appeal was whether the toy pistol constituted a dangerous weapon within the contemplation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:64 and 14:2(3) in the manner used by defendant under the circumstances of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ordered food at a restaurant window. When the employee asked for money, defendant took a toy pistol from his pocket and held it up in the air, demanding all of the money in the register. When the employee stated there was no money, defendant grabbed the food and began to walk away. The employee grabbed the food back and closed the window on defendant, who then left the window. Two policemen who happened to observe the incident arrested defendant. Because the victim's reaction to the toy gun could be considered by the jury in determining whether the toy gun, in the manner used, was likely to produce great bodily harm, and because the victim's subjective reaction indicated that he did not perceive any likelihood of great bodily harm, a reasonable trier of fact, by a view of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, simply could not have concluded that all elements of attempted armed robbery had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the discharge of defendant was neither necessary nor proper; the evidence supported a conviction on the lesser and included offense of attempted simple robbery, which was a legislatively authorized responsive verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the conviction and sentence for the crime of armed robbery, and the matter was remanded to the trial court with instructions to enter judgment of guilt for the crime of attempted simple robbery, and to sentence defendant accordingly.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of stabbing a restaurant manager multiple times and then shooting him at the restaurant. Defendant had quit his job as a waiter at the restaurant. On the night of the murder defendant was seen arguing with the victim and then driving towards the restaurant later that night with another individual. Later that night, defendant was observed to be bleeding from the hand, where upon he packed his clothes and left the state after telling his roommates to lie about his actions. Defendant appealed his conviction, raising numerous errors upon appeal. The court held that defendant was not prejudiced by the monetary limitation imposed by the trial court for hiring a private investigator. The trial court did not err in instructing the jury on the offense of conspiracy because the evidence supported such a charge. The prosecutor's statement that there was hostility between the victim and defendant was not improper because the statement was supported by the evidence. The court found that the evidence supported the jury's finding of two aggravating circumstances because the murder was committed during an armed robbery and was particularly heinous in nature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The restaurant association, the motel association, and the local chapter sought declaratory judgment that a city and parish resolution was arbitrary, unreasonable, discriminatory and violative of the federal and state constitutions as well as a preliminary injunction prohibiting the city and parish from enforcing the resolutions, which declared a moratorium on the issuance of liquor licenses. The city and parish filed peremptory exceptions, but the trial court was satisfied that plaintiffs had interests and standing to litigate the suit. The trial court issued a temporary injunction, and the city and parish filed a direct appeal. The court held that plaintiffs had made no allegation that they ever applied for a license or intended to apply for one. Thus, they had failed to show the existence of any real or actual interest to attack the ordinances or that the enforcement of the ordinances would result in an injury to themselves or any of their members. The court concluded that plaintiffs had not shown standing to prosecute nor a redressable injury. Thus, the peremptory exception should have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

As a result, defendants were charged by bills of information with letting premises for obscenity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:85.1 and with letting a disorderly place for the purposes of obscenity under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:105. The trial court quashed the bills and held that the statutes were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 7 (1974) protected freedom of expression. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:85.1 and 14:105 acted as prior restraints on publication and on expression and contained no procedural safeguards to assure a prompt final judicial decision to minimize the impact of possibly erroneous governmental action. Thus, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. 14:85.1 was unconstitutional on its face, and La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:105 was unconstitutional insofar as it applied to letting or allowing premises to be used for obscenity.</SPAN></P>

Defendant contended that the trial court erred in allowing the prosecutor to amend the indictment on the day of trial, in denying his motion for a continuance, and refusing to suppress witness's out-of-court identification of defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victims were shot and killed in a hotel room. Defendant was indicted on two counts of first degree murder on the day of trial; prosecution amended the indictment to charge only one court of murder in the second degree. The court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he concluded that the amendment did not prejudice defendant. Proof of a specific intent killing as an element of the offense was required under both first degree murder and for second degree murder. Thus, defendant would have been required to defend on this issue regardless of the charge. The court held that the lineup was unduly suggestive. The court held that the fact that the identification procedure used was suggestive did not automatically result in reversal or end the inquiry. Even if an identification procedure was suggestive, identification was admissible if the totality of the circumstances demonstrated that the identification was reliable. Considering the totality of the circumstances dealing with reliability, the court did not believe that there was a substantial likelihood of misidentification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the First Judicial District Court, Parish of Caddo (Louisiana), which sentenced him to 21 years imprisonment on his conviction for distribution of cocaine in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967B(1).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court felt that giving defendant a lesser sentence would depreciate the seriousness of the crime because of the magnitude of defendant's planned distribution operation. Defendant argued that the 21-year sentence was excessive in violation of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 20 (1974). The court held that, considering the size of the instant transaction and defendant's evident intent to open a new cocaine market, the sentence was not a manifest abuse of discretion. The court held that the penalty for distribution of cocaine was not excessive per se. A penalty range from 5 to 30 years for distribution of cocaine was not so disproportionate to the crime as to shock the court's sense of justice. Although cocaine might have been improperly classified as a narcotic drug, the imposition of a harsher penalty for cocaine distribution than for distribution of other non-narcotic drugs did not violate equal protection under the state and federal constitutions because the penalty classification was not devoid of rationality. Cocaine was extremely euphorogenic, there was evidence of its potential for physical as well as psychological addiction, and it was expensive and easy to conceal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At issue were certain acts codified as La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:61.1, that required the parish school board to reapportion itself on a certain date in accordance with certain specified procedures. Plaintiffs petitioned for a declaratory judgment declaring these acts to be illegal, unconstitutional and ineffective, and asked that defendants have been enjoined from enforcing the acts. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court found that there were no disputed issues of fact and that as a matter of law, legislative enactment of the statutes was authorized by the state constitution. Plaintiffs sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. The court held that pursuant to La. Const. art. 3,&sect;12 (1974) the legislature could not pass a local or special law. The court ruled that a statute was considered special or local if its restrictions could affect only a portion of the citizens or a fraction of the property embraced within the created classification. The court agreed with plaintiffs that &sect; 17:61.1 violated the constitutional prohibition against legislative enactment of local or special laws regulating the management of parish public schools.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State appealed a judgment of the Juvenile Court Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which denied its motion filed pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.1(D) to transfer the case against juvenile defendant to criminal district court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In denying the State's transfer request, the trial court found that the State had sufficiently established the prerequisites to transfer stated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.1. However, it found that deletion of the non-amenability clause which had been in the juvenile transfer statute prior to amendment by 1978 La. Acts 460, La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.1A(4), left the transfer statute without standards. He thus applied the criteria for juvenile transfer set out by the United States Supreme Court and found that the State had failed to meet its burden of proof, primarily because it had not shown an attempt to rehabilitate defendant. The court held that 1978 La. Acts 460, which amended and reenacted La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.1, was unconstitutional and that the passage of this unconstitutional act did not effect repeal of the former statute. Thus, the proceedings in the case were governed by &sect; 13:1571.1 as it existed prior to the passage of 1978 La. Acts 460. Because the State was prevented by La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.4A, from presenting evidence of defendant's non-amenability to treatment or rehabilitation, it was entitled to remand to present such evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the judgment and remanded the case to allow the State to attempt to introduce evidence of defendant's non-amenability to treatment or rehabilitation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted for first degree murder pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30, as amended by Act 74 of 1979. He filed a motion to quash, alleging the Act violated La. Const. art. 3, &sect; 15(A). The Thirty-First Judicial District Court, Parish of Jefferson Davis (Louisiana) sustained the motion. The State appealed. At issue was whether the Act was unconstitutional since it contained more than one object, providing for two different purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that because the Act contained amendments to both substantive and procedural law, and because the aggravating circumstances were to be considered in all capital cases, the Act contained more than one object. If all parts of a statute reasonably related, directly or indirectly, to one general and legitimate subject, the statute was not open to the objection of plurality, no matter how extensively it dealt with details looking to the accomplishment of the main legislative purpose. In the Act, the definitions of first and second degree murder and the list of aggravating circumstances to have been applied were not unrelated matters. The trial in a murder case was composed of two phases, the determination of guilt or innocence and the sentencing hearing. Since the adoption of bifurcated procedure, the circumstances contained in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.4 have been inextricably linked to the substantive murder provisions of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30. Therefore, it was not unreasonable for the legislature to consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the same bill which defined the capital offense. The Act was erroneously ruled unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court, which quashed the indictment, was reversed. The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the opinions expressed by the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot a security guard at a supermarket during the course of a robbery. Defendant claimed that the shotgun went off accidentally. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, rejecting defendant's numerous claims of error. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's challenge for cause of a prospective juror. The court found no evidence that hardship would prevent the juror from devoting full attention to the trial. The court also found that the evidence did not support defendant's contention of a psychologically coerced confession. Defendant objected to the admission of evidence related to the armed robbery, but the court held that the evidence was admissible as part of the res gestae. The court found ample evidence to support the jury's conclusion that defendant had specific intent to kill. Finally, the court held that the trial court did not err in imposing the death sentence. The court concluded that the death sentence was not per se unconstitutional and that La. Code Crim. Proc.

Ann. &sect; 14:1361 and public salary deduction after he told employees in his office to contribute money to his re-election campaign and promised that those who helped him would be helped in turn through their work evaluations. The indictments were quashed because the grand jury was unlawfully constituted, and defendant was reindicted for the same offenses. When a mistrial was granted on motion of defendant, he was tried again and convicted of public salary extortion and acquitted of public salary deduction. On appeal defendant's assertions were that there were deficiencies in proof, that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:136(1) was unconstitutional, and that he was subjected to double jeopardy. The court affirmed the conviction and remanded for sentencing. The court ruled that the connection between the employee monetary contribution to defendant's reelection campaign and the possible loss or impairment of the employees' employment was sufficiently explicit to make the conduct unlawful. The court ruled that &sect; 14:136(1) was not overly broad and defendant was not subject to double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari to review a judgment from the Fourth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Ouachita (Louisiana), denying defendant's motion to quash his indictment for simple battery of a person over the age of 65 in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 14:35 and 14:50.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 14:50.1 imposed an additional penalty on a defendant who was convicted of one of a number of specified crimes, where the victim was 65 or older. Defendant alleged that &sect; 14:50.1 was unconstitutional because it subjected him to excessive punishment for the crime of simple battery in violation of La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20 (1974). The court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:50.1 violated La. Const. art. 1, &sect; 20's prohibition against excessive punishment. The court noted that, in determining what was excessive punishment under the state constitution, the harshness of the penalty must be compared with the severity of the offense. According to the court, &sect; 14:50.1 suffered from two infirmities. The mandatory nature of the penalty could result in a sentence that was disproportionate to the severity of a particular crime. Furthermore, the statute failed to proscribe a maximum sentence that the court could impose; it merely provided for a minimum of five additional years. Therefore, a defendant charged under the statute could be faced with serving up to a life sentence, in addition to the sentence for the underlying offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment, which had denied defendant's motion to quash the indictment, and dismissed defendant's prosecution under a statute that imposed an additional penalty on a defendant who was convicted of one of a number of specified crimes, where the victim was 65 or older.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had been warned to stay off of the bus station property. He went to the station at the request of a friend to assist in purchasing a ticket for the friend's daughter.

In annulling the conviction, the court held that a conviction under &sect; 14:63.3(A) required proof of a reasonably contemporaneous warning to leave or stay off of the premises. The court noted that although defendant had been warned to stay off the premises, there was no evidence as to when that warning had last been made, so there was no way to determine whether the warning had been given in a reasonably contemporaneous manner. The court noted in particular that the bus station was a facility devoted to serving the public at large, as was the cafeteria, and that defendant had testified that he did not think that the prior warnings were intended to bar him permanently from the facility.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim's body was discovered the day following his murder with knife wounds in the back. After identifying certain pieces of bloody clothing, defendant confessed orally to the murder and signed a waiver of rights and a confession. He was convicted, sentenced, and sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The court rejected defendant's argument that the last member of the jury was selected in an illegal manner that warranted a mistrial. The court found that when a juror became incompetent during the course of trial and no alternate was available, a mistrial could legally be ordered because it was physically impossible to proceed. The court held that it was possible to proceed with the trial in the ordinary course, under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 796, because selection of the jury was not complete. The court ruled that a new trial was not mandated after there were allegedly illegal conversations between several jurors because under La. Rev. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari for relator juvenile to challenge an order of the Family Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), which overruled his objections to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.1, as amended by 1978 La. Acts 460. The juvenile objected that the statute was unconstitutionally vague because it authorized juvenile judges to transfer juveniles to the adult criminal courts without prescribing definite standards to govern the determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The juvenile was charged with committing an armed robbery. The court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1571.1, as amended, failed to meet the requirements of due process because of vagueness caused by its failure to set forth standards to enable juveniles to protect themselves against arbitrary and discriminatory forfeiture of the special rights and immunities of juvenile court jurisdiction. Because proceedings to waive juvenile jurisdiction had to measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment, the juvenile could not be transferred to the adult court under &sect; 13:1571.1, which was void for vagueness. The court stated that La. Const. of 1974, art. V, &sect; 19 authorized only a process for the transfer of juveniles to adult court in &quot;individual cases.&quot; Thus, the constitution did not permit the legislature to authorize a transfer according to the type of crime that the juvenile was accused of committing. While 1978 La. Acts 460 purported to repeal former versions of the transfer statute, it was ineffective to repeal the former statute and left a hiatus in the law. Thus, the matter was to proceed under the law as it existed prior to the passage of 1978 La. Acts 460.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court and remanded the matter for further proceedings under the juvenile transfer statute in existence prior to the ineffective amending and repealing act.</SPAN></P>

The indictment, however, improperly cited a subparagraph of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30. Defense waived any error caused by the improper citation. The court held that the disclosure of the informant was not relevant to defendant's case because it had no bearing on the issue of defendant's guilt or innocence. Therefore, defendant was not entitled to the disclosure. The court affirmed the trial judge's decision that the excluded witnesses were alibi witnesses whose identity was not timely disclosed by defense. The court affirmed the trial court's denial of a motion for a new trial based on the denial of defendant's right to a fair trial because three jurors who refused to impose a death sentence were excused.

Plaintiffs contended that defendants had failed to correctly assess taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A new system of property appraisal was established for the state. Plaintiffs complained that defendants had failed to comply with the new system and, therefore, certain revenues were lost through their failure to comply with the revised La. Const. art. VII, &sect; 23. Defendant tax assessor had asserted a third-party demand on third-party defendant city council. The court of appeals had reversed the part of the trial court's judgment that had dismissed assessor's third-party petition in mandamus. The question was whether plaintiffs were entitled to a writ of mandamus directing various governmental agencies and officials to comply with the new system. The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded the case. The court held that access to the courts was restricted to persons with a special interest apart from the interest of the general public. The court concluded that interference by the court at the instance of plaintiffs would surpass the authority allocated to the court in the tripartite system. Where there was no allegation that the court of appeal had erred in overruling the exceptions to the third-party petition, that ruling was not disturbed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff surviving wife, individually and on behalf of her two adopted minor children, applied for a writ of certiorari seeking review of a judgment of the Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, Parish of Acadia (Louisiana), which held that the children did not have a right of action against defendants, a driver, truck owner, their insurer, and others, arising from the death of their prospective adoptive father who was killed while unloading a truck.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The foster children were living with the decedent and his wife at the time of his death, and they were later adopted by the wife. In addition to affirming the trial court's decision that the children did not have a right of action, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the wife's wrongful death action based on her failure to intervene in the compensation insurer's previously filed action to recover compensation benefits paid to her. In affirming in part, reversing in part, and remanding the case, the court held that the lower courts correctly held that the children lacked a right of action under La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 2315. The minor children were not &quot;children&quot; of the decedent &quot;by adoption&quot; under art. 2315 because the adoption proceeding was not completed at the time of his death. However, the court held that the dismissal of the wife's action was in error. Under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 23:1101, the wife was not required to intervene in the compensation insurer's action to seek redress from the third parties who allegedly caused the decedent's death. Both the insurer's and the wife's claims were timely filed, and the cases were subject to consolidation by the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the appellate court's judgment insofar as it dismissed the action brought on behalf of the minor children.

In affirming defendant's conviction and sentence, the court held that the trial court: (1) under La. Code Crim. Proc. art. 722 erred in denying defendant's motion to compel discovery of statements made by the woman to police and to two grand juries, but the error was not prejudicial to defendant, (2) did not err in denying defendant's challenges for cause of three jurors after each juror stated that he could act in conformity with the trial court's instructions as to impartiality, (3) did not abuse its discretion in sustaining the State's objection to defendant's cross-examination of a sheriff's deputy regarding inconsistencies in defendant's statements, and (4) properly admitted evidence showing that the victim was shot twice in the head after he was already critically injured in order to show defendant's specific intent and to rebut the defense of justification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court quashed the indictment after holding La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:962(B) invalid as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch of the state government. Section 40:962(B) provided that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Resources should add a substance as a controlled dangerous substance if it was classified as a controlled dangerous substance by the Drug Enforcement Administration of the United States government. That procedure had been followed in the case of Talwin. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment quashing the indictment. The court noted that defining a crime was a legislative function and found that, under &sect; 40:962(B), the Secretary had the authority to add a substance to the Louisiana list of controlled dangerous substances, and once a substance was so listed it became a crime to possess or distribute the substance. The statute contained no standards or criteria to guide the Secretary, who merely added to the contraband list the substances found dangerous by the federal agency. This absence of standards resulted in a surrender of legislative power, and, therefore, &sect; 40:962(B) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the district court quashing the indictment against defendant was affirmed, and the prosecution was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, with advice of his attorney, pled guilty to two counts of driving while intoxicated (DWI). Four months later, after he waived counsel, he again pled guilty to DWI. Because that was defendant's third conviction for DWI, he fit the description of a habitual offender under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1472(A)(1)(b). He was subsequently adjudged a habitual offender, and his license was suspended. After defendant was again stopped by police, he was charged with unlawful operation of a motor vehicle after being adjudged an habitual offender in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 32:1480. On review, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, rejecting all of defendant's claims of trial court error. The court held, inter alia, that the fact that defendant never received notice that he had been adjudged a habitual offender did not violate his due process rights because defendant had been afforded an opportunity for a hearing and chose not to take it; and that because defendant was either represented by or waived counsel at all three convictions, the convictions could be used to subject defendant to imprisonment for driving after adjudication as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sentenced defendant as a habitual offender to serve sentences totaling 156.5 years at hard labor. In response to the 21 assignments of error raised by defendant on appeal, the court found, among other things, that the pretrial identifications of defendant were not impermissibly tainted because there was no suggestiveness or patent unfairness. The court also found that the trial judge had not abused its discretion when it declined to grant a mistrial after the victim's husband, after being discharged as a witness, walked over to the counsel table occupied by the prosecutor and embraced his wife in the presence of the jury because the conduct was nonverbal and there was no indication that it was intended by the couple or the state as a means of unfairly prejudicing the jury against defendant. The court refused to consider the possibility that defendant's sentence was excessive because he failed to list such an argument as an assignment of error. Accordingly, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, parish commission council and council president, learned of the theft of public funds by a council employee and informed defendant district attorney, who allegedly &quot;did substantially nothing.&quot; Plaintiffs then executed affidavits and charged the employee with theft, and defendant convened a special grand jury. Plaintiffs filed suit to compel the recusation of defendant and to enjoin him from taking any action with respect to the investigation of the theft. The trial court overruled defendant's exception of no cause of action. Although the court held that La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 690's provision for recusation was required by the constitutional guarantee of the fair administration of justice, the court reversed, holding that the petition stated no cause of action for the recusal of defendant because there was no constitutional protection against an unfair investigation except for the guarantee of a fair trial, where illegally obtained evidence would be excluded. Injunctive relief under La. Code Civ. Proc.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By agreement between the cooperative and a local school board, the cooperative was to furnish electrical service to a school located on land the board had leased from a federal military installation. The utility alleged that it already provided electrical service to the installation and that its electrical lines were closer to the school than those of the cooperative. The cooperative claimed that neither the commission's order prohibiting duplicative electrical service nor &sect; 45:123 applied to federally-owned property. The commission directed the cooperative to remove its equipment. The court affirmed the judgment approving that order, holding that the Supremacy Clause, U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2, did not preclude state regulation of electrical service to the military installation because Congress had not acted to exercise its exclusive jurisdiction in providing such services. The commission's exercise of its jurisdiction did not interfere with federal governmental functions because neither the school board nor the cooperative were federal instrumentalities.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff wife appealed a judgment of the Ninth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Rapides (Louisiana), which terminated previously ordered alimony payments from defendant husband to the wife on the basis that the statute that provided for the alimony, La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 160, was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The wife was granted alimony payments. The husband failed to pay and the wife sought a show cause order. The trial court found the husband in contempt and lowered the amount of alimony. The wife sought to return her alimony award to its original amount, and the trial court terminated the alimony on the basis that La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 160 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that based on a decision of the United States Supreme Court regarding the constitutionality of a similar statute in Alabama, art. 160, prior to its amendment by 1979 La. Acts 72, was violative of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and La. Const. art. I, &sect; 3. However, the court determined that its decision should not be given retroactive effect because the decision established a new principle of law by overruling clear past precedent on which litigants relied. Also, retrospective application would undermine the objectives of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 160. Finally, substantial inequity would result if prior judgments awarding alimony were declared invalid. Thus, all judgments awarding alimony prior to the effective date of the amendment remained unaffected by the court's decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The firm was a partnership organized under the laws of the State of New York. The partner and the associate were the only two members of the firm who were admitted to practice in Louisiana and who were practicing in Louisiana. Plaintiffs were informed that they were under investigation by the Bar's committee on the unauthorized practice of law, which believed that the activities of the partner and the associate in practicing for an out-of-state firm in Louisiana violated &sect; 37:213.

The court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs, holding that &sect; 37:213 was unconstitutional to the extent that it conflicted with La. State Bar DR 2-102(D). Rule 2-102(D), which was adopted by the court in the exercise of its inherent authority to regulate the practice of law, permitted partnerships to be formed by lawyers licensed in different jurisdictions. To the extent that La. Rev. Stat.

Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:967, on a guilty plea and sentenced him to imprisonment at hard labor for five years.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion to suppress complained that the affidavit supporting the search warrant did not aver that the confidential informant was reliable. The court noted that the affidavit stated that the informant arranged to make a buy from defendant, and defendant set up the meeting place and stated that his connection had ample stocks of marijuana and cocaine. Defendant then proceeded to the &quot;source&quot; under police surveillance. He entered a three-apartment building, exited with the drug, and proceeded to the meeting place, all under strict surveillance. Thus, the affidavit supplied ample factual foundation for believing the informant even though it did not aver that the informant had previously given correct information. Police were able to eliminate one apartment in the building and knew that defendant was on probation for distribution of marijuana. The court further found that it was reasonable for police to enter the apartment without knocking because defendant opened the door from the outside for them, and police had reason to fear that his live-in girlfriend would dispose of the drugs. Finally, the sentence was not excessive, but was the minimum permissible under &sect; 40:967.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance that levied a $ 100 tax upon the owner of any real property listed or assessed on the tax rolls of the city. The trial court ruled in favor of property owners who had challenged the tax, finding that the tax was invidiously discriminatory in violation of the equal protection requirements of the state and federal constitutions. On appeal, the court reversed. The court rejected the property owners' contention that the city lacked authority to levy the tax. The court found that the city was governed by a home rule charter, which allowed the city to levy, impose and collect any taxes necessary for the operation and maintenance of the city. The court also held that the tax was not rendered illegal by the fact that it was not levied in proportion to the property taxed. The court pointed out that there was no constitutional requirement that property be taxed in proportion to its value. The court found no merit to the property owners' equal protection attack and held that the ordinance created a class of parcels of real estate which had a rational relationship to a legitimate government revenue raising purpose.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that, to withstand scrutiny under the equal protection clause, classifications by gender were required to serve important governmental objectives and be substantially related to achievement of those objectives. The court held that the state's compensatory and ameliorative purposes were as well served by a gender-neutral classification as by one that was gender-based and therefore carried with it the baggage of sexual stereotypes and that the criminal neglect of wife law was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Second Judicial District Court, Parish of Jackson (Louisiana), which convicted her on a guilty plea of attempted aggravated kidnapping, in violation of La.

Defendant reserved her right to appeal adverse rulings of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant kidnapped a bank president's wife and demanded money for her safe return. When defendant left to pick up the money, the victim escaped from defendant's home. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a preliminary examination because defendant was indicted by a grand jury. The court opined that defendant's insistence on a preliminary hearing served only as a discovery device beyond the permissible limits prescribed by La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 716-723. Further, the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to quash the indictment because defendant had no standing to challenge the constitutionality of the kidnapping statute's death penalty. Defendant was never threatened with death because the victim was unharmed. The trial court also did not err when it ordered a sanity commission composed of two medical doctors, and not a psychiatrist. The court held that the ultimate decision on mental competence rested with the trial court, and the physicians appointed were qualified. Finally, considering that defendant might have been sentenced to 50 years, her lesser sentence of 20 years was undoubtedly influenced by mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the court found that the jury's verdict of guilty of attempted simple rape was responsive to the charge of attempted forcible rape against defendant because all of the elements of simple rape were included in forcible rape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged a judgment of the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans (Louisiana), that granted defendant's motion to quash a bill of information charging him with possession of pentazocine (Talwin), a controlled dangerous substance. Talwin had been added to the Louisiana list of controlled dangerous substances pursuant to La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:962(B) shortly before defendant was charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Drug Enforcement Administration classified Talwin as a controlled dangerous substance on February 9, 1979. On February 14, 1979, the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Human Resources added the drug to the Louisiana controlled dangerous substance list. On March 11, 1979, defendant was charged with possession of the drug. The notice adding Talwin to the list was published in the Louisiana Register on April 20, 1979. The trial court held that La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:962&nbsp;unconstitutionally delegated legislative authority to an administrative body and that defendant was deprived of notice in violation of due process of law and of the prohibition against ex post facto laws of La. Const. art. I, &sect; 23. The court affirmed the judgment. Assuming without deciding that the secretary had authority to add a drug to the list, the court held that, under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 49:953, no rule adopted by an administrative agency was effective until it was published in the Louisiana Register. Because publication did not take place until after defendant was charged, the addition of Talwin to the controlled dangerous substance list was not in effect on that date.</SPAN></P>

The car accelerated when the police officer turned on his lights and it eventually pulled over after about four blocks. The police officer saw several pieces of jewelry in plain view after the defendants left the car and discovered more pieces upon a search of the vehicle. The court affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress and held that there was probable cause for the stop for investigatory purposes since the car was spotted in the immediate vicinity of the crime, driving very slowly, and because the defendants tried to escape. Upon discovery of the contraband in plain view in the car, and because it was impractical to obtain a search warrant at that time, the warrantless search was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Revenue agents audited the dealership's counter tickets and repair orders created in different three-month periods. They found systematic discrepancies in the way the dealership collected, accounted for, and paid state sales taxes. La. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted for screening pornographic films in their theaters.

The court next held that &sect; 14:106 adequately informed defendants of the nature of the offenses and found that they satisfied La. Const. art. I, &sect; 13, and U.S. Const. amend. VI. The court next held that La. Rev. Stat.

The court also held that defendants' conviction by a non-unanimous six member jury did not violate their right to a jury trial because the jury was empaneled before the contrary constitutional decision was announced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought to quash the bill on the grounds that it was not in the long form provided for bills of information. The bill used some of the language of &sect; 14:285 but did not mention any specific conduct of defendant. The court first noted that defendant was correct that the sufficiency of the bill must be determined under the rules pertaining to long form indictments, since making obscene telephone calls was not a crime listed in La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 465, which provided for specific short form indictments charging certain enumerated crimes. The court next noted that, under previous case law, a long form indictment was required to contain the essential facts of the offense charged, without aid or supplementation from a bill of particulars. The court then overruled those cases. The court held that the indictment itself need not set out the detailed facts constituting the violation, since those facts could be given to the defendant by answers to a bill of particulars. If the indictment sufficiently identified the conduct charged and the statute violated, a motion to quash would not be sustained. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant drove his car into a fence and struck a tree and a house. The police came to the scene and arrested defendant for driving while intoxicated. The police called a private wrecker for defendant's mother to have the car towed to her house. Before the car was towed, one of the police officers proceeded to make an inventory search of the car's contents. The police officer found a plastic bag in the glove compartment that contained heroin. Defendant was convicted of possession of heroin. Defendant contended that the trial court incorrectly denied his motion to suppress because the heroin was found as a result of an illegal and warrantless search. On appeal, the court set aside defendant's conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court determined that the trial court should have granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence as unconstitutionally seized. The court found that there was no probable cause for the unauthorized entry into the car, which was to be towed to the house of defendant's mother. The court found no reasonable basis, prior to the illegal search, for impounding the car or for making an inventory of the contents without the owner's consent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff former husband filed an action seeking post-divorce alimony from defendant former wife. The district court denied the former husband's request for alimony while acknowledging that the inquiry into the former husband's ability to work was contrary to the precedent that held that the earning capacity of a wife was not a proper basis for rejecting her claim for alimony. The former husband appealed. The appeals court affirmed the denial of his claim, but based its decision on a decision that held that under Louisiana law husbands were not entitled to post-divorce alimony. After the rendition of the appeals court judgment and before the former husband applied for writs, the United States Supreme Court held that the Alabama alimony scheme, under which husbands but not wives were to be required to pay alimony, violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court granted writs and vacated and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings to determine if the former husband had entitlement to alimony citing a new amendment to La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 160 (1979) which allowed alimony awards to husbands.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a new trial grounded on the claim that the trial judge failed to deliver a copy of the court's written charge to him prior to reading it to the jury. He argued prejudice, although no objection was made at the time. He contended further that the trial judge erred in sentencing him before he was able to apply for writs to the court. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and held that where he failed to object to the failure of the trial judge to furnish the requested written charge, he waived the right to complain of error, if any, on appeal under La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 841. The trial judge was correct in refusing to charge the jury with the definition of second degree murder in the amended statute, which was not in effect at the time of the offense. Under the general saving provision, the amendment of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30.1 did not extinguish liability for the offense committed under the former statute. Defendant's sentence was vacated and remanded, because he had not, expressly, waived the 24-hour delay after his motions for a new trial and arrest of judgment had been overruled.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence, finding that the death penalty was constitutional. Further, the court found that the trial court did not err in failing to grant a motion in arrest of judgment for an allegedly defective indictment, in refusing to permit inspection of the grand jury testimony, or in refusing to allow defendant to inspect written statements of the State's witnesses. Moreover, the court held that the exclusion of 16 veniremen based on their conscientious objection to the death penalty was proper, evidence of defendant's blood stained clothing was properly admitted pursuant to a warrantless search based on consent, certain hearsay testified to at trial did not warrant a mistrial, and the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating ones.</SPAN></P>

However, while the charge remained classified as a capital crime, the United States Supreme Court had held two years earlier that capital punishment for aggravated kidnapping was constitutionally excessive. On appeal, the court reversed the district court ruling and remanded for a bail hearing. The court noted that a line of cases allowing the procedural rules for capital offenses to continue after the death penalty was no longer constitutionally allowed was merely interim regulation pending action by the legislature. However, the court held that legislative inaction in reclassifying such crimes could no longer curtail the constitutional right to bail under art. I, &sect; 18.</SPAN></P>

Days later the investigator swore out the appropriate complaints, and defendant was charged with improper passing, reckless driving, and speeding. At trial, defendant testified that he stopped only because he saw the flashing lights and heard the siren and that he surrendered his license only because he believed the investigator had the authority to demand it. The defense moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on the ground that the investigator did not have the requisite authority to arrest defendant and that any evidence obtained as a result of the arrest was therefore inadmissible. The trial judge denied the motion, found defendant guilty, and sentenced defendant. Defendant sought review. The court granted writs and reversed and remanded defendant's convictions and sentence, noting that the investigator's authority under La. Code Crim. Proc.

The court reversed and held that the city made no showing that plaintiff was absent from the state or unrepresented therein or that there existed a grave public emergency justifying alternate means of service of notice under the statutory scheme.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">La. Rev. Stat.

Defendant was charged under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:72, which prohibited forgery, a felony. Defendant claimed she should have been charged under La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:67.3, which defined the unauthorized use of a credit card, a misdemeanor. Defendant had allegedly tried to obtain $ 13 worth of store merchandise by using a stolen credit card and forging the signature on the credit sales slip. This conduct was criminal under either &sect; 14:67.3 or La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:72, so it was within the district attorney's discretion to charge her under the general forgery statute. Defendant claimed that &sect; 14:72 was unconstitutional because the possible 10-year sentence was excessive based upon the small amount charged. This, however, was the maximum penalty and was subject to suspension. Also, whether the sentence imposed under &sect; 14:72 was excessive could be better determined, if defendant was convicted, after sentence was imposed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled the buyer's exception of no right of action. At trial on the merits, evidence was presented that the decedent was survived by a sister and the trial court held that the children were not called to the inheritance. The appellate court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the children could not raise the issue of the validity of La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 919 for the first time on appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his older brother were charged and convicted of first-degree murder after they killed a young couple. The evidence showed that the older brother initiated the incident and pulled the trigger while defendant held a flashlight. Both defendant and his brother raped the woman. Defendant was sentenced to death. On review, the court found sufficient evidence by which a reasonable jury could convict defendant on first-degree murder charges given that defendant was present during the entire chain of events culminating in the shooting and that he admitted the rape. However, the court found that the death penalty, under these circumstances, constituted excessive punishment within the meaning of La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 905.9. According to the court, the death penalty in the instant case did not conform with sentences meted out in other first degree murder cases. The intention to kill was manifest in the other cases, but elusive in the present case. Moreover, defendant had been arrested only once and had never been sentenced to jail. Finally, it was clear that defendant was acting under his brother's influence when he committed the present crimes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the trial, the mother of one of the victims approached jurors several times and on one occasion showed them a school picture of her son. The jurors didn't report these incidents to the judge. When defendant was questioned, the police failed to administer Miranda warnings. The confession was never admitted, but shotgun shells obtained as a result of the evidence were. In affirming defendant's conviction, the court held that the jurors limited contact with the mother of the victim did not prejudice defendant. The court noted that the contact was brief, the photo was not prejudicial, and that there was no evidence the mother intended to influence the jurors. The court further held that the confession was not involuntary and that any taint attached to that evidence was attenuated by the other strong evidence of guilt at trial. In addition, the court rejected defendant's argument that the juvenile record of one witness should have been admitted on cross-examination and that the statute imposing a mandatory life sentence was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was found guilty, by a unanimous verdict of a 12-person jury, of second degree murder.

Defendant contended that it was error to charge him with first degree murder by alleging as the sole aggravating circumstance that the offense was committed in a heinous, atrocious, or cruel manner. The court noted that at the time of defendant's offense, unaggravated specific intent murder appeared punishable under both the first and second degree murder statutes. The court also noted that evidence surrounding the manner in which the victim was killed could not be excluded where it was part of the res gestae. The court further stated that the defense was not prejudiced in its trial preparation given that second degree murder was a lesser included offense for first degree murder.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from the judgment of the Thirtieth Judicial District Court for the Parish of Vernon (Louisiana), which convicted them on two counts of enticing minors into prostitution in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:86 after denying their motions to quash the indictment and their motion in arrest of judgment that were based on the ground that &sect; 14:86 contained an unconstitutional sex-based classification.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the time defendants committed the crimes, &sect; 14:86 prohibited anyone over the age of 17 from enticing any female under the age of 21 into prostitution. Defendants claimed that the statute could not be upheld because it failed to include males as possible victims. Defendants, who were over the age of 21, did not have standing to challenge the classification by asserting the equal protection rights of minor males. They had no relationship to minor males except as potential panderers. Also, 1978 La. Acts 434 changed the law to include minor males, so failure to allow defendants to assert the equal protection rights of this class would not result in any harm. Further, there was a rational basis in making females the sole victims in prostitution crimes because social problems were only caused when females were enticed. Although there was some evidence showing that the females were not enticed by defendants because they were already engaged in prostitution before the date in the indictment, there was also evidence of the essential element that defendants had been the ones to first lure the females into prostitution, and the court could not question the sufficiency of that evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of Iberia (Louisiana), where he was convicted of two counts of first degree murder in violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:30. Defendant was sentenced to death on each count.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his brother abducted and killed a young couple after raping the girl. Defendant was implicated in the crime and made admissions as to his involvement. Defendant was convicted of the murders and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed and asserted a variety of arguments. On review, the court rejected all contentions concerning the asserted trial errors. The court found that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that defendant and his brother abducted the couple with the intention of forcing the female victim to engage in sexual relations in order to secure the couple's safe release. Thus, there was no error in the jury's finding that aggravated kidnapping was an aggravating circumstance. The court also concluded that there was no evidence which suggested that the sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factors. The court further found that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could rightfully have concluded one or more statutory aggravating circumstances existed and that the sentence was not disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases. Thus, the sentence of death was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the 20th Judicial District Court, Parish of West Feliciana (Louisiana), which convicted defendant of simple escape pursuant to La.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the offense of simple escape, and was sentenced to serve a term of four years imprisonment at hard labor, to run consecutively to his prior sentence. On appeal, defendant argued that his conviction was improper because he did not depart from the confines of the penitentiary grounds before he was apprehended. The court agreed. The court held that defendant's actions in running from his assigned work did not come within the definition of simple escape in effect at the time of the incident. The court held that defendant was not physically restrained or actually confined within the okra patch in which he was working and his departure therefrom could amount to no more than an attempt to escape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged by writ of certiorari a judgment from the Criminal District Court, Parish of Orleans, Louisiana, which granted defendant's motion to quash a bill of information charging him with obscenity, a violation of La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106, on the ground that it failed to charge an offense punishable by a valid statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bill of information was filed charging defendant with obscenity. The information alleged that defendant indecently and publicly exposed his person in a place open to the view of people or the public at large with the intent of arousing sexual desire. The victims observed defendant from below defendant's apartment as they were walking in the parking lot to an apartment on the first floor. Defendant filed a motion to quash the information arguing that it failed to charge an offense punishable by a valid statute. The trial court granted the motion. On appeal, the court reversed. The exposure of defendant's genitals was criminal if it was accomplished in a place that was &quot;viewable&quot; from any location open to the view of the public at large. The parking lot of the apartment complex was such a place. Although the lot was private property, it was not enclosed, did not have a security system, and was not posted as private property. Visitors to the apartment complex could enter and use the lot. The lot shared significant similarities with the locations enumerated in La. Rev. Stat. Ann. &sect; 14:106(A)(1), and an act of exposure seen from the parking lot could be prosecuted under the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the ruling of the trial court granting defendant's motion to quash and remanded the case for further consideration.</SPAN></P>
