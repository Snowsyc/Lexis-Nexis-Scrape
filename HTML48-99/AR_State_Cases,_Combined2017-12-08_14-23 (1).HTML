<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant inmate filed a petition for a declaratory judgment and writ of mandamus in the Jefferson County Circuit Court (Arkansas), requesting that appellees corrections officials be required to recompute the inmate's parole eligibility date.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate had been convicted and sentenced for felonies on three separate occasions. Relying upon Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43-2807.1 (Supp. 1985), the corrections officials determined that the inmate was ineligible for parole until he served a 10-year sentence for his second conviction for armed robbery. The trial court agreed and denied the inmate's petition for a declaratory judgment and writ of mandamus requiring the corrections officials to recompute the inmate's eligibility date. Affirming, the court stated that &sect; 43-2807.1, enacted in 1983, provided in pertinent part, that any person who committed aggravated robbery, subsequent to March 24, 1983, and who had previously pleaded guilty, nolo contendere, or been found guilty of aggravated robbery, would not have been eligible for release on parole. Clearly, this statute was in effect when the inmate committed his second aggravated robbery in September 1983. Therefore, he was charged with the knowledge of that law when he committed the crime.</SPAN></P>

The next day defendant was arrested and charged with the murder of the police officer. Defendant confessed after three and one-half days of questioning. During that time defendant did not have a lawyer present, and he was not permitted to call anyone. Defendant was found guilty of capital felony murder and sentenced to death by lethal injection. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in admitting his confession because he did not waive his rights, and he was never brought before a magistrate for a prompt first appearance as required by Ark. R. Crim. P. 8.1. The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case, holding that the defendant's statements were reasonably related to the unnecessary delay. The court also concluded that there was not a sufficient waiver of defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel in this case. The court further concluded that the prosecutor should have been disqualified because he became a potential material witness.</SPAN></P>

The court held that held that &sect; 34-706 did not violate the father's equal protection rights. The trial court had discretion to enlarge, diminish, or vacate any order in such filiation proceedings as justice might require. Therefore, it did not discriminate on the basis of sex.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The incapacitated person challenged Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 57-840 (1985), based on his contention that the statute denied him procedural due process because it authorized the granting of the guardianship without notice, and, after guardianship was granted and after his detention, it did not authorize a review hearing, or safeguard hearing, with the right to have counsel and the right to cross-examine witnesses. On review, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and dismissed the case. In reaching its decision, the court agreed with the incapacitated person's contention that the statute resulted in an unconstitutional denial of due process in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court based its decision on the finding that the statute lacked a provision for a meaningful review hearing and lacked a provision for the incapacitated person to receive meaningful notice in advance of such a review hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother's motion to dismiss the petition, alleging that the county court's jurisdiction over juvenile matters was unconstitutional, was denied. On appeal, the constitutionality of the Arkansas Juvenile Code's placement of jurisdiction of juvenile matters in county courts was again challenged. The court reasoned that juvenile court delinquency hearings were required to encompass the essentials of due process and fair treatment given to adults. However, the court held that county courts did not possess the same judicial safeguards as other state courts. The court reasoned that by virtue of state and federal regulations and funding in this area, it was obvious that the primary focus was with the state and not with the county. The court stated that county courts, by their very nature, were unable to ensure the proper disposition of juvenile delinquency cases. Therefore, the court held that jurisdiction over juveniles could not have, under any circumstances, been placed in the county court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant robbed a pawnshop and shot the proprietor during the course of the robbery. He was convicted and sentenced to death. Defendant appealed the conviction and sentence, both of which the court affirmed. It was not error for the trial court to answer a question from the jury regarding parole, especially where defense counsel agreed to a response. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing a last-minute request for a change of venue. Business records of the victim were that were kept pursuant to the requirements of a federal agency were admissible under Ark. R. Evid. 803. A warrantless search of defendant's van when he as apprehended after he emerged shooting from the van was a lawful inventory of the vehicle. Statements that did not negate defendant's guilt were not exculpatory and there was no error in the state's withholding of the statements. Statements that tied defendant with a violent religious organization were admissible to demonstrate the methods and purposes of the crime, which was strikingly similar to an aborted plan to rob a pawnshop. The court concluded that proof of defendant's guilt was overwhelming and that defendant received a fair trial.</SPAN></P>

The doctor filed a motion to dismiss on the basis of Ark. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), contending the complaint failed to state facts upon which relief could be granted. After refusing the patient's request for a deposition order, the Boone Circuit Court (Arkansas) granted the doctor's dismissal motion. The patient appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The patient contended that the trial court erred in refusing to require the doctor to submit to a deposition and that the court should apply the &quot;discovery rule&quot; to the effect that the statute of limitations was tolled until 1984, which was when the patient discovered the alleged medical injury. The court found no error in the refusal to require discovery where the complaint was, on its face, fatally deficient, and Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-2616 precluded application of the discovery rule. The court affirmed the judgment. In support of her contention that she should have been allowed to take the doctor's deposition, the patient argued in effect that the purpose of a complaint was merely to put the defendant on notice of the claim. However, the complaint was supposed to contain facts showing the pleader was entitled to relief, and it did not. The patient contended that the statute of limitations did not bar the action because her claim was filed within two years of the time she discovered that the doctor had misdiagnosed her condition thus causing her medical injury. The cause of action accrued at the date of the wrongful act complained of, and the action was barred.</SPAN></P>

The court did not find any merit in these contentions. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and enhanced sentence. The court first noted that the evidence was sufficient to determine that he was driving while intoxicated. Next, the court found the legislature had the authority to create the municipal court at issue, even though the particular act under which it was formed was defective as a special and local act.

A jury convicted defendant of second-degree murder and he was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment. Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court found that the trial court's failure to instruct the jury that voluntary intoxication was a defense to second-degree murder was proper because voluntary intoxication was no longer a defense in criminal prosecutions. Further, the court ruled that based on the totality of the circumstances, the trial court's decision to admit defendant's confession was not against a preponderance of the evidence. The court determined that the testimony about the prior beating was admissible so long as it was for a purpose other than to prove the character of defendant. The court found that it was error on the part of the trial court to permit the police officer to summarize the confession when the actual confession was about to be played for the jury. However, the court ruled that the trial court's error did not substantially affect the fairness of the trial, and was harmless.</SPAN></P>

The court found, inter alia, that (1) the issue was not whether regulations under the Code allowed differences in the treatment of activities generally similar in character, but whether there was a rational basis for such differences; (2) the Equal Protection Clause did not require that all persons be dealt with identically, only that classifications rested on real rather than feigned differences, that the distinctions had some relevance to the purpose for which the classification was made, and that the treatment was not to be so disparate as to be wholly arbitrary; and (3) the mere fact that a partial use of one's property was burdened by regulation did not amount to a taking.</SPAN></P>

When the State called defendant's wife as a witness, counsel objected on the ground that under Arkansas law the State could not call one spouse as a witness against the other. The State relied on Unif. R. Evid. 504(b), by which only confidential communications between spouses were privileged. The defense insisted that the Uniform Rules of Evidence were not validly adopted by the legislature, because the legislature was unlawfully in session almost a year after the regular session had ended. The trial judge overruled the objection on the ground that a marriage three days before trial did not create a privilege. The court held that: (1) the practice of continuing the legislature in session after its regular session ended was not permitted by the Arkansas Constitution; (2) therefore, the Uniform Rules of Evidence were adopted at an invalid session of the legislature and had not become law; (3) the court adopted the Uniform Rules of Evidence as the law in Arkansas as of the date of the court's opinion; and (4) a reversal was required because defendant's wife was permitted, over a proper objection, to testify against him.</SPAN></P>

A misfire occurred, apparently from faulty ammunition, and the bullet penetrated only one centimeter. Defendant argued on appeal there was no such crime as attempted battery, and he should have been charged with aggravated assault instead. The court held that defendant took a substantial step to carry out his purpose. Only because of the misfire was such a misfortune avoided. The court concluded that the evidence in this case supported the charge of attempted battery in the first degree. Defendant also argued that since the injury was not serious, his conduct constituted battery in the third degree because it required only physical injury. The court held that the fact that the bullet struck the victim would not preclude a charge for attempted first degree battery, because using the plain language of the statute, the conduct fit the crime defined as an attempt to commit serious physical injury to another.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, a corporation and its manager, sought review of a judgment of the Pulaski Circuit Court (Arkansas) after they were convicted of and fined for possessing and promoting obscene materials under a state obscenity statute, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-3584 et seq. (Supp. 1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Based on materials that police purchased from the corporation's adult bookstore, the prosecuting attorney issued a felony information against defendants. On appeal from their convictions, defendants contended that the obscenity statute violated equal protection principles. In affirming the convictions, the court held that the exemption for employees of motion picture theaters in the obscenity statute, pursuant to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-3585.7, did not violate equal protection principles because bookstore clerks, unlike motion picture theater employees, could actively promote the sale of obscene materials by recommending them to their customers. The court rejected defendants' argument that the distinction was unreasonable, finding that the materials were not entitled to close scrutiny under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution because they were obscene. The court also determined that the statute's exemption for educational and governmental employees did not violate equal protection principles because the legislature could have reasonably believed that employees of such facilities would not disseminate obscene material in the course of their regular employment.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 75-817.2, 75-817.3 and 75-819(b) (Supp. 1985), collected by appellee Arkansas Highway and Transportation Department, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trucking association filed a complaint against the department, alleging that the HUE tax would be an &quot;illegal exaction.&quot; The complaint was certified as a class action. After a trial on the merits, the chancery court ruled that the tax was constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that it found no evidence that the HUE tax discriminated against interstate commerce. The fact that out-of-state trucks did not make extensive use of the state's highways did not make the tax discriminatory. The flat tax rate of $ 175 was not shown to be excessive or unreasonable. Interstate commerce was not singled out for disparate treatment, and no classification on that basis was made, so no equal protection problem arose. All of the named plaintiffs were corporations that had no standing to challenge the tax on privileges and immunities grounds. There was no disparate treatment in weighing in-state and out-of-state trucks, so there was no basis for a claim of discrimination. Ark. Const. amend. 19, &sect; 2 was inapplicable because the HUE did not impose a privilege tax but, rather, exacted a user fee from motor vehicles carrying the prescribed weight.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The litigant was convicted of a misdemeanor in municipal court. He sought to avoid paying a filing fee for appealing to the circuit court from the conviction. On appeal the court agreed with the circuit judge's ruling that a fee had to be paid. 1977 Ark. Acts 1 established a uniform advance fee to be charged by circuit clerks for initiating a cause of action in the circuit court. Section 1 went on to provide that if a cause of action in the circuit court became unusually lengthy and the filings became so voluminous that the advance fee proved inadequate, an additional fee could be assessed. One of the enumerated fees was for entering each appeal from inferior court. The litigant argued that filing an appeal from municipal court was not &quot;initiating a cause of action&quot; in the circuit court, but the court held that the statute clearly indicated otherwise. The litigant also argued that he could not be charged a fee for demanding his constitutional right to a jury trial. The court held that the litigant's right to a jury trial was irrelevant to his refusal to pay the fee imposed by law for the circuit clerk's services.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant lowest bidder, an intervenor in an injunction action, challenged a decision of the Pulaski Chancery Court (Arkansas), which entered summary judgment for appellee next lowest bidder, plaintiff in the injunction action; dissolved a temporary injunction against appellee state highway commission (commission), defendant in the injunction action; and found that appellants did not comply with 1977 Ark. Acts 102 (Act 102).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Act 102 gave complying bidders the contract if their bid was less than three percent above the lowest bid, if the lowest bidder did not comply with Act 102. On appeal, the court affirmed the chancery court's decision. The lowest bidder argued that Act 102 only applied to contracts covered by the provisions of 1949 Ark. Acts 159 (Act 159). Act 102 was limited to contracts covered by Act 159 as amended by 1957 Ark. Acts 183 (Act 183). The argument that Act 159 excluded the commission rested upon 1977 Ark. Acts 370 (Act 370). A closer inspection of Acts 102, 159, and 370 did not support the lowest bidder's contentions. If the legislature intended the commission excluded, it would have been placed on the face of the acts and was not. The drafters intended that Act 102 would apply to all contracts included in Act 159 before Act 370. Any other reading would have effectively repealed the application of Act 102. Alternatively, the lowest bidder did not meet Act 102's requirement of paying taxes and Act 102 was found constitutional under a rational basis test.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant mother challenged a judgment of the Probate Court of Pulaski (Arkansas), which granted the petition of appellee Administrator of Arkansas Social Services to appoint a guardian with power to consent to adoption without notice to, or consent of, the natural parent and terminated the mother's parental rights to three of her children pursuant to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 56-128(F)2.a.i., 56-128(F)3, 56-128(H) (Supp. 1985).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Upon the Social Services' initial discovery of the 13-year-old mother and her oldest illegitimate child destitute and alone in a home without gas, water, or food, the mother's children were placed in foster care at various times. In the absence of the putative fathers and despite remedial support services, the mother left her neglected children unattended, failed to secure proper medical care, and did not further her education or secure a job. By applying a clear and convincing standard of proof, the probate court found that placing the children in the mother's custody would raise a substantial risk of serious harm to the children due to the mother's irremediable inability to provide for their basic physical, mental, and emotional needs over an extended period of time. On appeal, the court affirmed the probate court's decision to terminate the mother's parental rights pursuant to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56-128(F) by finding that the unfit mother had not benefited from the remedial support services she received. Given the sole factfinder's full implementation of the required burden of proof, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56-128 was constitutionally valid as applied to the mother's case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the probate court's judgment for the Administrator, while noting that the probate court's 16-month delay in deciding the case violated state statute.</SPAN></P>

The victim's burned out car was later found a short distance from defendant's hobo home. Following an arrest on a separate charge, defendant asked the officer, &quot;What are you arresting me for? For killing that guy?&quot; Later, after being arrested for the murder, defendant was able to show the police the precise location of the victim's body, as well as the murder weapon. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. The court ruled that the evidence, taken together, was sufficient to sustain the conviction for capital murder. Although defendant made a statement that he was an unwilling bystander to the crimes, which were committed by his companion, the jury was not required to accept his testimony as uncontradicted.</SPAN></P>

The parties had agreed to arbitration and a panel awarded damages to the district. A special judge ruled that the award was subject to joint and several liability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The district contracted with the architect to prepare plans and specifications for the construction of a school building. The contract was awarded to the contractor and the contractor subcontracted the foundation work the subcontractor. After the arbitration panel rendered its decision, an issue arose as to whether the judgment should provide for joint and several liability. While the first judge had that issue under advisement he had a heart attack. Just before the chief justice assigned the case to a second judge, a special judge was elected and rendered a judgment in the case, and then the second judge entered a judgment in the case. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded, holding that because the lawfully elected special judge had already exercised jurisdiction over this pending case, his judgment took priority over the judgment of the judge assigned at a later date. Furthermore, the special judge's action on the case was fulfilling the purpose of Ark. Const. art. 7, &sect; 21. Finally, because the subcontractor agreed to arbitration the circuit court could enter a judgment against it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The other laundry services brought an action against the city hospital laundry corporation to enjoin it from operating a commercial laundry for anyone other than itself. The other laundry services argued that the arrangement between the city, which owned the hospital, and the city hospital laundry corporation violated Ark. Const. art. 12, &sect; 5. The lower court entered judgment in favor of the city hospital laundry corporation. Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the arrangement was expressly sanctioned by Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-4713 (1980), which gave broad authority to municipalities to engage in and adopt the methods challenged in the current matter and recognized by Ark. Const. &sect; 1, amend. 32. The court found that the leasing of the hospital by the city to be operated by a nonprofit corporation was not a violation of Ark. Const. art. 12, &sect; 5. The reversion of assets to the city in the event of a dissolution was not an expectancy, but a mere possibility, and one which may never occur. The court found that laundry service was essential to the operation of a hospital, and the method used to fill the need was proper.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the primary issue was whether or not the statement given to the police officers resulted from a custodial interrogation. The State contended that the statement was a voluntary, spontaneous statement and thus, a Miranda warning was not required even if defendant was in police custody. The court held that defendant's motion to suppress should have been granted because his confession was not volunteered and spontaneous but was instead the result of questioning in custodial interrogation. The court determined that defendant was in police custody because of his age and the place of interrogation. Defendant was questioned in a police car and was only 17 years of age. Defendant was of marginal intelligence and maturity, and had never been arrested prior to the interrogation. He was ordered to stay in the police car with another officer before the confession occurred. Thus, he was in custody and should have been given a Miranda warning.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 34-1801 (Supp. 1985), the descendents challenged a judgment of the Van Buren Chancery Court (Arkansas) that partitioned certain land, ordering it sold and the proceeds divided.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The descendants inherited an undivided interest in some land. The buyers purchased the undivided interests 12 other descendants in the land and brought the partition action. The chancery court found that it was impossible to partition the land in kind. Affirming, the court ruled that the chancellor had the statutory authority to decide whether a partition in kind was feasible. The question was one of fact, and the answer depended on evidence of the nature of the land and the nature of the owners' interests. That the descendants were willing to take a smaller tract was not compelling because there was no evidence to show that such a division was fair in terms of the comparative value of the two tracts. The judgment below was not, therefore, clearly erroneous or clearly against the preponderance of the evidence. The court also rejected the descendants' claims that the partition statute was unconstitutional, concluding that their argument was actually a claim that black persons were being required to sell ancestral lands by those who abused the statute. The court concluded that there was no evidence to that effect and no evidence of a lack of notice or racial discrimination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Subsequent to the creation of a fire protection district, a suit was brought seeking a judgment which would declare the district to be void because of the failure to conform with the statutes in forming the district. The chancellor upheld the formation of the district and the court affirmed. A second suit was brought alleging that the cited statutes were unconstitutional. The first suit sought to void the creation of the improvement district, but the validity of the statutes was never questioned. Appellants, who had been the same initiating parties as those in the first suit, again sought to destroy specific interests and rights, such as the authority to levy and collect taxes or fees, by claiming that the statutes were unconstitutional. The court found that both suits involved the same cause of action and that appellants had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the constitutionality of the statutes in the first trial. Thus, their claim was precluded by res judicata.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The revenue commissioner denied the foreign corporation a permit to sell tobacco products in Arkansas, citing Ark.

The court concluded that the statutes were unconstitutional to the extent that they prevented nonresidents from engaging in business in Arkansas. The court ruled that the statutory scheme was a burden on interstate commerce. The statute discriminated on its face and was fatally defective even if a legitimate purpose was recited. The court ruled that it found no rational or other relationship between the requirement that only Arkansans bring cigarettes to Arkansas for sale and the stated purpose of ensuring that the tobacco was fresh and uncontaminated. The practical effect of the statutes was unrelated to the purposes stated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Rule 37 provided that postconviction relief was available to prisoners in custody under the sentence of a circuit court. In his application, petitioner claimed, inter alia, that a juror at his trial was both mentally incompetent and biased against him. The court rejected that argument, finding that the issue of the juror's mental incompetence could have been questioned at trial or in a motion for a new trial. Further, petitioner did not show that the juror's presence resulted in a deprivation of a constitutional right so fundamental as to void the judgment of conviction. Petitioner further claimed that the trial court failed to authorize sufficient funds and failed to grant a continuance so that counsel could establish a defense of mental incapacity. The court also rejected that argument, finding that although the State had to assure petitioner access to a competent psychiatrist, an indigent defendant did not have a constitutional right to choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or to receive funds to hire his own doctor. Petitioner did not show that he was unable to obtain the assistance of a competent doctor with the funds and time available.</SPAN></P>

Appellant sought review of a decision by the Fulton Circuit Court (Arkansas), which determined that Act 905 was constitutional.

The court held that Act 905 was unconstitutional because the differences between it and the general legislation, which regulated the creation of municipal courts, bore no reasonable relation to the need of the particular county for a municipal court. The court also held that appellant, as recipient of a judgment by the court in question, was a person whose rights were affected and he therefore had standing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that a death qualified jury was unconstitutional and that the Arkansas system of selecting jurors at random from the current list of registered voters, pursuant to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39-205.1 (Supp. 1985), did not result in a jury system drawn from a fair cross-section of the community as a whole, because under the system blacks and persons between the ages of 18 and 34 were under-represented. As such, defendant asserted that the trial court erred in declining to quash the jury panel. Defendant relied upon the testimony of a political science professor provided in a case two years earlier, where the professor was not qualified as an expert or able to support his assertions regarding jury selection. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court and found that a death-qualified jury was constitutional. The court could not reach the constitutional issue regarding jury selection because defendant's proof in the trial court was so deficient that the motion to quash the panel could not have reasonably been sustained. Decisions of a constitutional question by the court required appropriate presentation of the issues.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant taxpayer challenged the decision of the Jefferson Chancery Court (Arkansas), which determined that the resolution of appellees, Board of Directors of the Arkansas Student Loan Authority, members, and directors, authorizing certain revenue bond issues for student loans were not violative of Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect;1 and Ark. Const. amend 20.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board's resolution authorized the issuance by the Student Loan Authority of student loan revenue bonds and student loan revenue refunding bonds, pursuant to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 80-4036 (1980). No public election was held nor was one scheduled to authorize the issuance of the bonds. The taxpayer argued that the bonds violated Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 1 and Ark. Const. amend 20 because they lent the credit and pledged the revenues of the state, that the Arkansas Student Loan Authority Act violated Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect;&sect; 1,2, and that the bonds were illegal because they were not issued for a public purpose. The court determined that because the bonds were to be repaid from income derived from the loan notes and investments, the bonds did not constitute an indebtedness or obligation of the state. The court found that there was no delegation of legislative power in the Act. Thus, the Board's resolution did not violate the state constitution. The court further concluded that the bonds were clearly issued for a public purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In the sheriff's election, the challenger, a write-in candidate, sought the office against the nominee. The first tally of votes declared the challenger the winner. The nominee was granted a recount and after a number of votes were discarded, the nominee was declared the winner. The challenger filed an action contesting the election. The challenger alleged that the election commission should not have conducted the recount because the nominee's letter requesting a recount did not meet the requirements of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3-508 (1976). The trial court found the recount request insufficient, but proceeded with the election contest, found the election commission had improperly discarded some of the write-in votes, and declared the challenger the winner. The nominee sought review. The court found that the challenger's action sufficiently stated his allegations, that the nominee's allegations regarding suspicions of the write-in votes were properly dismissed by the trial court, that the nominee's recount letter was insufficient, and that the nominee was not ousted from the position of sheriff because the sheriff's term had not begun when the action was filed before the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mobile homeowners, under Morrilton, Ark., Ordinance 10 (Ordinance), sought permission to place a mobile home in a residential district. Following proceedings before the Commission, this permission was granted. The minutes of the proceedings before the Commission stated in a conclusory form that the Ordinance had been complied with so far as necessary in order to permit the variance. In reversing the Commission, the circuit court held that appellees had standing to seek review, that the Commission did not comply with the terms of the ordinance, and that Morrilton, Ark., Ordinance 10, &sect; 3 was arbitrary unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, noting that the record on appeal to the circuit court was inadequate to apprise the circuit court of the manner and scope of the hearing before the Commission and that the circuit court did not err in conducting a de novo review. Also, appellees had standing to seek review. However, the court noted that, in holding a trial de novo, it became unnecessary for the circuit court to sua sponte hold portions of the ordinance unconstitutional. Thus, the constitutionality of &sect; 3 of the Ordinance should not have been addressed.</SPAN></P>

The landowner contended that the annexation was in violation of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19.307.1 (1980).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city adopted an ordinance which proposed the annexation of 15 separate tracts of land. An election was held and the vote was in favor of the annexation. All of the challenges to the annexation, excepting the landowner, were dismissed. The trial court upheld the annexation. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the findings of the trial judge were not clearly erroneous. The facts constituted evidence that the tract could be annexed as lands representing the actual growth of the city beyond its legal boundary. While a pecan orchard existed on a part of the tract, it was permissible to annex a tract of land if that tract was more valuable for city purposes than for agriculture, even if the one tract was more valuable for farming purposes than for city purposes. The court ruled that it was proper for the city to annex property if it was needed for the purpose of making improvements and if value of the land was derived from actual and prospective use for city purposes. Annexation was not prohibited simply because a tract was &quot;rather rugged&quot; and &quot;heavily wooded&quot; with sparse population.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of an order of the Independence Circuit Court (Arkansas), which convicted him of driving while intoxicated (DWI) pursuant to 1983 Ark. Acts 549. The jury found him guilty of a third such offense and imposed an enhanced sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant argued that the act was unconstitutional because it was vague and established a conclusive presumption of guilt, that it unconstitutionally compelled defendants to testify against themselves, and that the admission of prior convictions was erroneous because the record did not show that he was represented by counsel. On appeal, the court held that (1) appellant's first two constitutional arguments against 1983 Ark. Acts 549 had previously been rejected by the court; (2) the admission of blood test results did not violate appellant's rights against self-incrimination because the result were not testimonial and were admissible under the state's implied consent law, in accordance with Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-1045 (Supp. 1983); and (3) one of appellant's prior convictions was not adequately proven where a municipal clerk testified that the 1981 conviction had been altered in 1983, when a stamp was entered on it stating that appellant was advised by the court of his right to counsel and waived all rights, and the clerk testified that it was the policy of the judge to ask a defendant if he was represented by an attorney or wished to be, and that one was appointed if necessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the constitutionality of the act but reversed the trial court's admission of a 1981 conviction as a predicate offense for enhancement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landfill operator made an application to the department, seeking a permit for operation of a sanitary landfill. The department denied the application and the operator sought judicial review. The trial court heard the matter de novo and allowed additional evidence to supplement the record. Thereupon, the trial court determined that the department wrongfully denied the application and ordered that the permit should be immediately issued. On further appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court, holding that a trial de novo was inappropriate. The court held that the department had the right, within its police powers, to determine the suitability of a site for a landfill, and that it was not judicially cognizable because the effort to obtain a permit hinged on executive discretion. Accordingly, the court held that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 82-1906(7) (1976) was unconstitutional. The court noted that review of decisions to determine if they were arbitrary or capricious was allowable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the statute allowing the trial court to conduct a de novo review of the department's determination whether to issue a permit to the landfill operator was unconstitutional. The matter was remanded for a proper review of the department's actions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The heirs brought an action against the Trustees, contending that a gift of land to the Trustees resulted in a charitable trust and that it had become impossible to carry out the purpose of the trust. Therefore, the heirs contended, the land should have been divested from the Trustees and reverted to the heirs. The trial court ordered title to the property to remain in the Trustees subject to the performance of certain trust obligations. The heirs appealed, contending that the heirs were entitled to a judgment by default because of a delay in the filing of the Trustees' answer and that the trial court's finding that it was not impossible to carry out the grantor's wishes was against the evidence. The Trustees appealed, contending that the trial court should have dismissed the heirs' claim under Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect; 20 and that the trial court erred in concluding that the grantor, with the deed and accompanying agreement, created an express charitable trust for a particular charitable purpose. On appeal, the court held that the trial court correctly held that if the Trustees failed to demonstrate good faith intentions to develop the property, it was to revert to the heirs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant estate sought review of a judgment of the Pulaski Probate Court (Arkansas), which was entered in favor of appellee, who was a decedent's second wife, in her action to elect her dower rights against the will. The estate maintained that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-501 (Supp. 1983) precluded the second wife from asserting her dower right by taking against the will.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The decedent drafted a will, bequeathing his personal property to his first wife and the rest of his estate to a family trust. After his divorce, the decedent married the second wife, and their marriage lasted less than one year before the decedent died. When the will was admitted to probate, the second wife filed a petition to elect her dower rights against the will, and the estate objected, contending that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-501 (Supp. 1983) precluded her from doing so because she had not been married to the decedent for more than one year. On appeal from the probate court's entry of judgment in the second wife's favor, the court held that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-501 did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because the classification in the statute was rationally related to the state's interest in discouraging deathbed marriages. The court also held that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-407 did not require a holding that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-501 was not intended to be applied when a will predated a marriage because although a bequest to a former spouse was void under Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 60-407, the remainder of the will remained in effect.</SPAN></P>

The court on appeal affirmed defendant's conviction and upheld the constitutionality of the Act. Ark. Stat.

The court held that the two subsections and the definition of intoxicated in Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 75-2502(a) (Supp. 1983) of the Act gave fair warning of the conduct prohibited by the Act and set out a sufficient standard for police enforcement and for ascertainment of guilt. Therefore, the court held that the Act was not unconstitutionally vague and passed constitutional muster. The court also held that testimony by a police officer that defendant was intoxicated was not inadmissible under Ark. R. Evid. 704.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff, a citizen and taxpayer, appealed a judgment by the Pope Chancery Court (Arkansas) in favor of defendants, Arkansas Housing Development Agency and individual agency board members, and a bank, in an action filed under Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 13 and the Declaratory Judgment Act, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34-2501 et seq. (1962). The citizen sought to enjoin the issuance of Single Family and Multi-Family Mortgage Bonds under 1977 Ark. Acts 427.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The citizen contended that the bonds violated the Arkansas Constitution and were not for a valid public purpose. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the bonds issued were authorized and issued by the Arkansas Housing Development Agency (AHDA) pursuant to 1977 Ark. Acts 427 and were not issued by the State of Arkansas or in the name of the state. The bonds were obligations only of the AHDA and did not constitute an indebtedness of the state under 1977 Ark. Acts 427, &sect; 10.00. The AHDA issued the bonds solely and exclusively as its obligations and 1977 Ark. Acts 427 specifically provided that the bonds were of the obligation only of the AHDA. The court found that the bonds were secured by a lien and pledge of the loans or mortgages purchased from the proceeds and the collateral security received by the AHDA. Therefore, the court held that the state did not lend its credit. Consequently, 1977 Ark. Acts 427 and the proposed bonds to be issued did not violate Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 1. The court also concluded that the public service was served by aiding low and middle-income residents to secure adequate housing that would have otherwise been beyond their reach.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the punishment for four defendants was enhanced based on certificates of prior convictions, that defendants were not represented by counsel at their prior trials, that waiver of counsel could not be presumed from the certificates, and that the four defendants' convictions were required to be reversed. The court held, however, that the State was not required to preserve samples of the breath tests, that the Act did not establish a conclusive presumption of guilt, that the .10 percent blood alcohol standard under the Act was reasonable and bore a direct relationship to the State's interest in protecting its citizens, and that the Act was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

In the alternative, defendant claimed that he was entitled to rely on the statute until it was declared unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding first that the general assembly was divested of the power to regulate fishing by the amendment. Moreover, defendant was not entitled to rely on the statute affirmative defense to violations of the Commission's regulations because he was not aware of the existence of the statute at the time of the violation. Therefore, defendant's argument that he relied upon the statute was too late. Finally, defendant failed to plead the statute as an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2206(3) (Repl. 1977) and Ark.

The court stated that it had previously upheld the constitutionality of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2206. Next, the court held that it was not prejudicial error for the trial court to submit to the jury both the guilt and sentence questions at the same time. It noted that defendant and his counsel had agreed that the questions be submitted together. Turning to defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the court stated that in asking defendant about his prior convictions, counsel may have been using a trial strategy of presenting defendant to the jury as having changed his ways. The court stated that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the constitutionality of &sect; 41-2206 and the instruction because the court had previously decided the question. Finally, the court stated, defendant's trial attorney and the attorney he had hired for his appeal each testified that defendant had chosen to drop his appeal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was later arrested at his home where two guns were confiscated. After a period of treatment at a state mental hospital, defendant was found to be capable of assisting in his defense and was tried. On appeal, the court affirmed. Although defendant argued that the jury panel should have been quashed because they were improperly summoned by ordinary, rather than certified, mail, the court found that defendant had not demonstrated how any error had prejudiced him. The court also determined that defendant was not prejudiced by the summary excusal of certain jurors, such as persons over 65. While defendant alleged that keys to the victim's vehicle were obtained illegally, the court held that defendant threw the keys out of his home voluntarily and that no interrogation occurred, although police had surrounded his home. Even though defendant alleged that he was entitled to further funds for a private examination by a psychiatrist, the court held that he was not denied due process because he was examined by four doctors while in the state hospital.</SPAN></P>

P. 22, which gave discretion to the trial court to try defendants jointly in a capital case, unconstitutionally repealed Initiated Act I of 1937. Act I entitled co-defendants in capital cases to separate trials as a matter of right. Petitioners also contended that their counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the severance issue. In denying the petition, the court held that the repeal of an intiated act by means of a vote of the legislature allowing the adoption of nonspecific rules of criminal procedure did not void judgments in cases tried under the adopted rules of procedure. Moreover, the trial court's denial of petitioners' motion for severance on the grounds advanced at trial and considered on appeal was also unavailable to petitioners as a basis for postconviction relief. Further, petitioners failed to demonstrate on appeal that the jury was unable to fairly distinguish between them in the guilt and penalty phases of the trial. As petitioners failed to establish that severance was necessary to protect their right to a fair trial at any stage of the proceedings, their sentences were not disturbed.</SPAN></P>

Prior to being charged, he received notice of noncompliance and was given five days to comply. Defendant was found guilty of refusing to send a minor to school in violation of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 80-1502 (1980). The court affirmed, holding that defendant did not have standing to challenge the statute on the ground of vagueness. In so ruling, the court stated that the language of the statute was clear enough to put defendant on adequate notice that a course of home study would not constitute a school within the meaning of the statute. Indeed, someone of average intelligence would readily recognize that defendant's educational methods did not constitute a school, as such term was commonly understood. Further, the statute did not violate defendant's First Amendment right to religious freedom. While doubtless sincere, defendant made no showing of a religious or cultural tradition regarding home schooling and did not show that a ban on home schooling would result in serious harm to the practices of a distinct group.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the court held that the property owner's knowing acquiescence in permitting the property to be used as a parking lot was a violation of the ordinance. All persons having an interest in property were bound by the zoning of that property to the extent that they could not authorize, permit, or require any use of it contrary to zoning.</SPAN></P>

The probate court granted the petition. The father appealed, claiming the statute upon which his rights were terminated, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56-128 (Supp. 1983), was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The father claimed that &sect; 56-128 violated his substantive due process rights, was unconstitutionally vague, and that the evidence did not support the probate court's finding. The court affirmed. The evidence showed that the father was mildly retarded, failed to understand the child's needs, and failed to improve in his care of the child. The best interests of the child supported the finding the child's needs were better met outside the home. The test for substantive due process was whether or not the statute advanced a compelling state interest and whether the statute was the least restrictive method available to carry out the state interest. A statute terminating parental rights had to be scrutinized with flexibility and in order to avoid being vague under due process standards, it had to have given a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his conduct was forbidden. Mathematical certainty was not required, just language that was capable of common understanding. It would be impossible to delineate specific conduct that was acceptable or unacceptable and the statute had to be broad enough to encompass all proscribed behavior. The statute was found constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employees were comparison shopping in Wal-Mart for their employer, K-Mart. The employees were asked to leave by a Wal-Mart manager after they were caught attempting to write down Wal-Mart prices, which was a violation of store policy. When the employees refused to leave, the Wal-Mart manager called the police, who cited the employees for trespassing in violation of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 71-1803. The employees were convicted in both the municipal and the circuit courts. The supreme court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 71-1803 was not repealed by Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-2004 (Repl. 1977) because there was no plain conflict between the more general &sect; 41-2004 and the more specific Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 71-1803. The court held that &sect; 71-8103 did not violate the public's constitutional rights because Wal-Mart's invitation for the public to shop in its store and make purchases did not mean that it could not prohibit a competitor from remaining in its store to gather information. The court held that the employees were not protected by the First Amendment right to receive information because Wal-Mart's prices were posted for the public.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled the motions, and defendant then sought a second change of venue. On appeal from the denial of the motion and the conviction of defendant for capital murder, the court held that: (1) although defendant was forced to accept jurors he would have peremptorily challenged had he not exhausted those challenges, the jury finally selected qualified within the meaning of the Witherspoon doctrine; (2) the trial court was not required to grant a continuance to accommodate defense counsel, who was overworked, or for defendant to discover the name of a witness, who, once discovered, could not appear for trial, because the witness's testimony was presented to the jury through the statements of defendant's counsel; and (3) the admission of defendant's custodial statement was not clearly against the preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also granted judgment against appellant's action for an injunction and for damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees used the landowner's road for more than two years in order to gain access to the county courthouse. The county had graded the road for six years and six months at the time the suit was filed. More than 10 families used the road as the most direct route to the county courthouse. The road served as a mail route. Appellees brought a lawsuit that sought a declaration that the landowner's land was subject to a prescriptive easement. The court reversed the decision of the trial court that granted the easement and held that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 76-104, 76-105, 37-109 did not shorten the time limit for obtaining a prescriptive easement. These statutes were enacted to protect rural roads from adverse possessors. Further, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 76-101 (Repl. 1981), which declared that all roads worked with public funds were public roads, did not contain a limitations period for obtaining a prescriptive easement. The court held that the road had not been used for the seven years that were needed for appellees to establish a claim for a prescriptive easement. The court remanded the case to the trial court for a hearing on the landowner's claim for an injunction and for damages.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the revenue bonds at issue did not violate Ark. Const. amend. X, and that Ark. Const. amend. XIII had no application.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicant was a nonresident who applied to the State of Arkansas for a music machine operator's permit. The State denied the permit because the applicant did not meet the one-year residency requirements of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 84-2634(b),(c) (Repl. 1980).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The jury found that the employee, while employed by the school district, negligently caused an accident with plaintiff. The school district did not have liability insurance as required by 1969 Ark. Acts 165 (Act 165). Plaintiff sued both the employee and the school district. The jury awarded plaintiff a $ 35,000 judgment against both and the trial court entered an order limiting the liability of the school district to $ 10,000 for the personal injury and no more than $ 5,000 for the property damage. The court affirmed. The court stated that when a political subdivision, such as the school district, mentioned in Act 165 failed to carry motor vehicle liability insurance, it became a self-insurer, if found liable, in an amount not to exceed the minimum amounts prescribed in the Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act. Act 165 had two purposes: to declare as public policy that the state and its political subdivisions were not liable for tort and to require all political subdivisions to carry liability insurance on their motor vehicles. The court found that such limitations on public entities' liability were legal.</SPAN></P>

Acts 616, the legislation under which their convicting municipal court was created.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Act 616 provided an alternative procedure for the creation of a municipal court by a city of limited financial means that lacked a local attorney. Plaintiffs filed an action challenging their misdemeanor convictions on the ground that the Act, under which the convicting municipal court was created, violated Ark. Const. amend. 14, and the court reversed the trial court's judgment for defendants. The court held that the Act's population classification was arbitrary and had no reasonable relationship to cities of limited financial means or lacking a local attorney. Thus, the Act could never apply to any other county, and although it clearly related to the administration of justice, it violated the constitutional prohibition against local or special legislation. While other statutes did apply to only individual counties or judicial districts, those statutes were not local or special because they were based upon reasonable considerations and non-discriminatory classifications. Thus, the Act was unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the judgment of guilty was affirmed, but the sentence was reduced to life without parole unless the State elected to retry defendant. The State attempted to prove as an aggravating circumstance that defendant committed crimes on two other occasions involving an element of violence. Because the State could not produce convictions in either instance it, in effect, tried defendant for these crimes during the penalty phase of the case. The jury thus heard evidence that merely amounted to an accusation that defendant committed two other crimes, not substantial evidence that he did. The reliability of the surviving victim's identification was a discretionary decision for the trial court. The admission of a fish stringer was not prejudicial per se and could not inflame the jury. It was circumstantial evidence that the jury could consider in determining defendant's guilt. An &quot;Allen&quot; or &quot;dynamite&quot; charge was not error because it had been approved before, and the court declined to overrule its prior decisions.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect;&sect; 56-206 and 56-207 (Supp. 1983) were unconstitutional as applied to putative fathers. However, the court found that the father had no standing to assert the argument because the statute was not applied to him in a discriminatory manner. He was given the same consideration afforded a mother who did not have custody. Therefore, the court did not reach the merits of the father's constitutional argument. The father's argument that he did not receive notice of the petition for termination of parental rights was rejected. He entered his appearance and Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56-220(c) did not require a separate termination petition in this adoption proceeding. The father did not have to relinquish custody voluntarily to be a parent not having custody within the meaning of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 56-220(c).

The court held that the city did not have a sufficiently definite plan for development, which justified a contribution from the developer. The court determined that something reasonably definite was essential to a plan requiring the dedication of land or the contribution of money from the developer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants filed a determination of heirship after the decedent had died intestate. The trial court held that the distinction between ancestral estates and new acquisitions now recognized in the Arkansas law of descent and distribution had been abolished in 1969 and had not been reinstated. Under 1969 Ark. Acts 303, &sect; 19 the decedent's property passed to the administrator, her surviving husband, according to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61-149(b). Appellants argued that although ancestral estates were abolished as to intestate succession, such estates were completely restored by 1981 Ark. Acts 714, &sect; 23, which recognized the distinction between ancestral estates and new acquisitions in the determination of a surviving spouse's dower or curtesy under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 61-206 (Supp. 1983). The court held that 1981 Ark. Acts 714 revised specified sections of the compiled statutes to eliminate distinctions regarding property rights between spouses and specified more than 70 sections that were being amended. Affirming the judgment, the court stated that the statute made no reference to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61-148 (1971), which abolished that distinction as to intestate succession.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owners contendedthat an ordinance prohibiting private clubs from serving or allowing consumption of mixed drinks between 2:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. was invalid. The trial court granted appellees' summary judgment motion. The court held that the ordinance was not in conflict with Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-203(h) (1977) because that statute authorized the Commissioner of Revenues to fix the hours for the sale of intoxicating liquors. The ordinance at issue was not concerned with retail sales but with consumption on the premises of private clubs. The court held further that the penalty provision of the ordinance was not in conflict with Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-901 (1977), which provided penalties for the unlawful sale of intoxicants, because the statute describing on-premise consumption at private clubs, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-1401 et seq. (1977 and Supp. 1983), specifically provided that consumption at a private club was not a sale. The court held that based upon the Home Rule Act, Ark. Stat.

The court also held that a jury system that had served its purpose admirably throughout the nation's history ought not to be twisted out of shape for the benefit of those persons least entitled to special favors. The court reasoned there was nothing which would prevent a juror strongly opposed to capital punishment, in an effort to avoid feeling any responsibility for a death sentence, from choosing to hang the guilt-innocence jury by a vote for acquittal.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that it had previously declared Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61-201 (Repl. 1971) unconstitutional in a case where a widow asserted a claim of dower against a will.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The victim, who was 12 years old, testified that his father had taken him to defendant's house on 19-20 occasions over a two-year period and that defendant had sex with him on each occasion except for three or four.

A jury convicted defendant of 20 offenses of carnal abuse and fixed his sentence at the statutory maximum of 10 years imprisonment and a $ 10,000 fine for each offense. The trial court later ordered the sentences to run consecutively. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction for 16 of the 20 offenses; (2) a cumulative sentence of 160 years imprisonment and a $ 160,000 fine was not barbarous, outside the law, or wholly disproportionate to the nature of the offense charged; and (3) an affidavit supporting the issuance of a search warrant for defendant's residence, which was based on an informant's statement, was sufficient because it indicated the reliability of the informant and the circumstances from which he concluded that the items to be seized were where he said they were.</SPAN></P>

The commission upheld the constitutionality of state income tax exemptions on the retirement income of government employees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayers contended that the tax exemptions constituted an immunity, which did not upon the same terms apply to all citizens, and that the tax exemptions were special acts, and therefore violated Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 18 and Ark. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the court held the Arkansas State Constitution imposed restrictions of its own on the power to tax and the corresponding power to grant immunities from taxation. The court held Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 18 prohibited the general assembly from granting privileges or immunities, which upon the same terms were not equal to all citizens. Also, Ark. Const. XIV prohibited exercising state powers through local or special legislative acts. The court the held under the rational basis test there was a presumption the legislation was constitutional and rationally related to achieving a legitimate government objective. Therefore, since the state's classification conferred a benefit upon public employees, which was available to all workers of that calling and class throughout Arkansas, the court held that art. 2, &sect; 18 and the U.S. Const. amend. XIV were not violated and affirmed.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-1302 (1977) contemplated that persons on the jury would be capable of imposing the death penalty. The evidence established that defendant's statement to police was voluntarily made where the interrogating officers did not abuse defendant in any way, defendant was advised of his rights, defendant agreed to make a statement, and no promises, threats, or coercion were used to obtain the statement. The trial court did not err in refusing to sequester the jury during defendant's trial where each juror was thoroughly questioned about media influence and each one selected was admonished to refrain from discussing the case or obtain information from the media. The jury's finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances was supported by evidence of defendant's four prior felony convictions involving the use of threat of violence to another person.</SPAN></P>

The husband and second wife appealed and the first wife cross-appealed. The court affirmed, holding: (1) the tenancy by the entirety became a tenancy in common upon divorce; (2) estoppel did not prevent the first wife from asserting an interest because the husband was aware of her interest and the first wife indicated that she wanted to reach an out of court property settlement when the parties were divorced; (3) laches did not bar the first wife's claim entirely, because the husband did not change his position in ignorance of her interest; and (4) laches did bar the first wife from sharing in the increase in value based on the husband's and second wife's improvements because the first wife could have asserted her claim earlier.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee school districts filed a class action suit against appellants, members of the Arkansas State Board of Education and other school districts, alleging that the system for financing public schools was unconstitutional. Appellants challenged a decision of the Pulaski Chancery Court, First Division (Arkansas), which declared the system unconstitutional because it violated Ark. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 2, 3, and 18, and Ark. Const. art XIV, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Public schools in Arkansas received funds primarily from three sources: state revenues, local revenues, and federal revenues. State revenues were mainly dispersed without consideration of a district's change in student population, educational needs, or property wealth. This system resulted in sharp disparities among school districts' expenditures per pupil where educational opportunities were dependent upon the wealth of the local tax base. The court affirmed the trial court's decision that the system was unconstitutional because it violated the state constitution's guarantee of equal protection and its requirement that the state provide a general, suitable, efficient system of education. The court concluded that there was no legitimate state purpose to support the system and that the system bore no rational relationship to the educational needs of individual districts because it was determined primarily by the tax base of each district. The court found that the right to an equal education was basic to society and that equal protection was not served when some districts were only able to provide basic educational opportunities while other programs were richly endowed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court also denied a motion to have the costs taxed against appellants.</SPAN></P>

The municipal court entered a judgment of conviction against the property owner. The circuit court entered judgment affirming the conviction. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and dismissed the action. The court held that the zoning ordinance did not give the property owner fair warning in definite language that his acts were prohibited and that the zoning ordinance was too vague to be enforced through the criminal law. The court held that a law that was so vague and standardless that it left judges or jurors free to decide, without any legally fixed standards, what was prohibited and what was not in each particular case failed to meet due process requirements. The court rejected the city's argument that the property owner knew about the governing standards of the ordinance through his application for a permit for a non-conforming use because the validity of the criminal provisions of an ordinance was required to be determined by the language of the ordinance itself.</SPAN></P>

The utility company filed a writ of prohibition which sought to prohibit the trial court from exercising jurisdiction over a class action suit for declaratory judgment filed by the customers and ratepayers. The court granted the utility company's writ of prohibition. The court held that the customers and ratepayers' contentions should have been presented before the PSC rather than the trial court because the PSC had exclusive jurisdiction over matters pertaining to utility rates. It also held that it did not have concurrent jurisdiction with the PSC in public utility litigation when there was a clear, adequate, and complete remedy by an application to the PSC.

Defendant was sentenced to death for felony murder and to 40 years imprisonment for hindering apprehension or prosecution. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted and sentenced in connection with the murder of a police chief. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion for severance of the offenses, and that the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict and in admitting certain statements made by defendant. Defendant also argued that the death penalty was unconstitutional in his case and that the trial court erred in denying his motion challenging the death qualification of prospective jurors, in allowing his impeachment by use of a prior robbery conviction, and in requiring him to be tried while incompetent to stand trial. Additionally, defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his request for certain subpoenas and in failing to suppress certain evidence. The appellate court reduced defendant's death sentence to life without parole because (1) the evidence overwhelmingly showed that defendant was merely an accomplice, and (2) the jury might have sentenced defendant to death out of passion and prejudice because the main actor had been killed and could not be tried. As so modified, the court affirmed the judgment convicting and sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed.

The court further held that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion in limine by which he sought a ruling that, if he chose to testify, the State could not impeach him by evidence of previous felony convictions if he conceded that he had previously been convicted of one felony. According to the court, Ark. R. Evid. 609 did not limit the number of convictions which could be used to impeach defendant's veracity. Also, the court rejected defendant's attack on the admissibility of various physical exhibits as fruits of the poisonous tree. According to the court, defendant consented to the search of his car. In addition , the court held that the trial court properly denied defendant's challenges to certain prospective jurors for cause and that defendant's argument that the penalty was so severe as to indicate passion and prejudice could not be sustained.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate contended that the Arkansas death penalty statute impermissibly penalized his exercise of his right to plead not guilty and to have a jury trial because only the jury could impose the death penalty, thus creating a situation whereby the inmate could have been assured of escaping execution only by waiving his right to trial by jury. The court rejected this contention, holding that Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-1302 (1977) provided that the jury was to impose a sentence of death if it returned certain written findings, but the trial judge was not required to impose the death penalty in every case in which the jury verdict prescribed it. The court rejected the inmate's ineffective assistance of counsel challenge, holding that the inmate failed to show that he was denied a fair trial by defense counsel's failure to call any particular witness or his failure to question any witness further. The court rejected the inmate's constitutional challenges to the death penalty, holding that the death penalty under Arkansas statutes had consistently been held constitutional.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 76-110 (1981) after the Boone County Circuit Court (Arkansas) affirmed a county court decision that condemned a portion of the aggrieved landowner's property to provide a public access road for appellee, an adjoining property owner whose land was totally encircled by the aggrieved landowner's property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Under &sect; 76-110 the adjoining landowner successfully petitioned to have a road established across the aggrieved landowner's property because there was no access to his land from any public road. The court on appeal affirmed and upheld the constitutionality of the statute. The court rejected the aggrieved landowner's argument that the statute was unconstitutional because it was only for private use whereas the Arkansas Constitution granted the right of eminent domain only for public use. A road established under &sect; 76-110 was deemed a public road because anyone could use it, even though the term private road was used in the statute. A road was public if it was free and common to all citizens regardless of the number of people actually using it. The public access road did have a private use relative to the adjoining landowner. However, creation of the road was a constitutional use of the power of eminent domain because it served a legitimate public interest, the creation of a road available to the public and transformation of otherwise useless land into potentially valuable and productive property.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The widow received a dower interest in a partial distribution of the decedent's estate. Thereafter, the gender-based dower statutes were declared unconstitutional in Stokes v. Stokes, 271 Ark. 300, 613 S.W.2d 372 (1981). The daughter filed a petition to bar the widow from receiving a dower interest in the remainder of the estate. The trial court granted the interest. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court ruled that the Stokes decision did not apply retroactively to the widow's case. The daughter treated the dower interest as having been vested. The trial court found that the attorney for the daughter expressly recognized the widow's dower interest. Thus, the court concluded that it was unable to say that the holding of the trial court was clearly erroneous. The court ruled that the trial court properly applied the principle of estoppel against the daughter. Although there may have been no intent on the part of the daughter to mislead the widow, if the widow was misled by the daughter's failure to object to her claim of dower interest in the part of the estate which was distributed, the widow could claim estoppel as to the balance of her dower interest in the estate.</SPAN></P>

Two days before the trial defendant moved in limine to prevent the State from introducing evidence of his seven prior convictions for driving while intoxicated (DWI). In the hearing on the motion, defense counsel did not deny that the defendant had been drinking before the accident. The trial court granted the motion. During his opening statement, defense counsel told the jury that the defendant would testify that the collision was an accident. The State's witnesses testified about defendant's intoxicated condition. The trial court announced that if the defendant's proof indicated that the collision was a &quot;pure accident,&quot; and defendant testified, the trial court would allow cross-examination about his previous DWI convictions. Defendant did not testify. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not commit reversible error in changing its ruling during the trial because lawyers often told juries that a defendant would testify and then refused to call him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The city argued that although its ordinance levying a privilege tax on the waterworks commission was labeled as a privilege tax, it was not really a tax and that the term used did not necessarily invalidate the legislative enactment. The court disagreed with the city's argument and affirmed the judgment in favor of the residents. The tax in question was mandatory, was passed directly from the waterworks to the residents and back to the city without regard to costs of operations, maintenance, depreciation, and debt. The rate was not a part of the water rate and was designated a privilege tax by the ordinance. The court held that the rate was clearly an unauthorized tax and therefore, an illegal exaction. The city also argued that the trial court erred in refusing to disqualify the residents' attorney because the attorney was also representing the city in another action at the time of the action at bar. The court held that because the attorney had been representing a government entity, he should have withdrawn himself from representing the city and the residents, even if he had received the consent of both parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed that holding in favor of the residents finding that the privilege tax was an illegal exaction, modified the amount of the judgment and disallowed the attorney's fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged convictions for two counts of capital murder and robbery based entirely on circumstantial evidence. Defendant's girlfriend testified that defendant, who used several aliases, left for the town in which the offenses occurred one morning and returned that night with duffel bags full of jewelry. Price tags from the stolen jewelry were found in a storage room rented by defendant in another town. A number of witnesses positively identified defendant at a photo lineup, an actual lineup, and in court. Some did not. On appeal, the court held that the prosecutor's allowing one witness to examine the photo lineup during a trial break while defendant was still seated in the courtroom was error but waived by failure to object. Defendant's girlfriend was not legally deemed an accomplice and was properly permitted to give incriminating testimony. A defense expert's testimony as to the unduly suggestive nature of photo lineups in general was properly excluded at the suppression hearing and at trial. Fingerprint cards were properly admitted to link defendant with several aliases relevant to the case. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee franchised auto dealer challenged the constitutionality of the general assembly's act of creating a motor vehicle commission, 1975 Ark. Acts 388, Ark. Stat. Ann., tit. 75, ch. 23 (1979). Appellants, Arkansas Motor Vehicle Commission and others, sought review of a decision of the Pulaski Chancery Court (Arkansas), which held the act invalid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In an attempt to enforce a regulation that prohibited a dealer from claiming that its prices were guaranteed lower than elsewhere or guaranteeing to sell for less, the Commission threatened to revoke the dealer's license because it had advertised that it had the &quot;best prices in Arkansas.&quot; The dealer challenged the constitutionality of 1975 Ark. Acts 388 in its entirety. Following earlier supreme court cases, the chancellor held Act 388 invalid. On appeal, the court did not reach the constitutional issue and remanded the case for further factual development. In each of the five acts, the general assembly made findings that the proposed licensing and regulation of manufacturers and franchised dealers were necessary. None of the acts mandated licensing for used-car dealers. In Act 388, the legislature declared numerous intentions, including the prevention of frauds, unfair practices, discrimination, the sale of unnecessary accessories, and false and misleading advertising. Given the presumption in favor of constitutionality, the legislature's findings could not be disregarded without proof that there was no factual basis for the classifications and prohibitions embodied in Act 388.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the chancery court's decision and remanded the case to the chancery court for further proceedings in which the dealer would have the burden of proving that all or part of the act was unconstitutional and other parties, such as a representative manufacturer, could be brought into the action if appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The State's case against defendant was based on the testimony of the victim that during a number of visits to defendant's apartment he had been shown pictures of homosexual acts between young men and boys and that defendant had suggested that he and defendant engage in similar acts. The child said he was fondled and on two occasions defendant put the child's penis in his mouth.The boy's mother reported these charges to the police. A search warrant was issued and homosexual pornography was seized including pornography of adolescent boys. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that because defendant was not charged with a violation of Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 41-3565 (2) (Repl. 1977); he had no standing to attack its constitutionality. The search warrant was not invalid because the affiant did not appear before the issuing judge because Ark. R. Crim. P. 13.1(c) did not require the judge to interview the witnesses; simply that he could interview them. Due process did not require that a defendant had an unfettered right to take the discovery deposition of the State's witnesses. The victim was competent to testify. The motion for directed verdict was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for rape by engaging in deviate sexual activity with a six-year-old boy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant residents challenged a decree of the Pulaski Chancery Court, First Division (Arkansas) that held that 1981 Ark. Acts 539, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19-704.1 et seq. (Supp. 1981), was a valid legislative action. The residents alleged that the Act was unconstitutional as a violation of Ark. Const. amend. 14, which prohibited local and special legislation. The residents sought the Act's invalidation and to enjoin appellee city from enforcing it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act essentially had two operative provisions. It provided that in the 1982 general election cities having a population of 100,000 or more according to the most recent federal census and a city manager form of government had to directly elect the mayor by a majority vote, and that each director in such cities would have to be elected by a majority vote, rather than a plurality, in the 1982 general election. In reversing and remanding, the court held that the Act was special legislation that contravened Ark. Const. amend. 14. The mayor in a city, regardless of its size, having a city manager form of government merely presided at board meetings, was recognized as head of the city government for ceremonial purposes, and signs all written agreements on behalf of the city. In the absence of some reasonable statutory difference in the powers or functions of the mayors of cities of different sizes, the court could not, although the Act was accorded presumptive validity, find any reasonable basis for granting to one city but not others the power of directly electing its mayor and holding runoff elections for the positions of mayor and city directors two weeks after the general election.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the chancery court's decree and remanded with directions that the injunction be issued.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants relied upon two statutes in their appeal of a decision by appellee, the Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, to grant a license to a certain liquor store. The Pulaski County Circuit Court, Third Division (Arkansas) required appellants to elect their remedy. The trial court granted the Board's motion to dismiss after the remedy chosen, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-311(E) (Repl. 1977), was abolished by a higher court's decision.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board granted a liquor license. Appellants filed a petition for review, relying upon Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5-713 (Supp. 1980) as well as Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48-311(E) (Repl. 1977) in their appeal. The trial court required them to elect which statute they would use as their remedy. Some months after they chose &sect; 48-311(E), the Supreme Court of Arkansas declared the de novo portion of &sect; 48-311(E) unconstitutional. The trial court denied appellants' request to transfer their cause to Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5-713, holding that their election of remedies was irrevocable and dismissing the petition. In a case of first impression, the court held that where the remedy sought was declared unconstitutional, the litigants had to be treated as though that statute had never been passed. The elected remedy was not available to appellants, and, thus, there was only a mistake, not an irrevocable election of remedies. Consequently, the election, made without fault and in ignorance of material facts, was not binding because no other person's rights were affected thereby. The proper remedy was to reinstate appellants' petition and allow the trial court to continue from that point.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's decision granting the Board's motion to dismiss, reinstated appellants' petition, and remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Act 135 of 1965 (Act), Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 41-3852 through 41-3863 (Repl. 1977).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees initiated an action against the stores to enjoin the stores from engaging in retail sales of certain prohibited articles on Sunday in violation of the Act. The stores filed answers, challenging the constitutionality of the Act. After trial, the trial court permanently enjoined the stores from selling the prohibited articles on Sunday, finding that the stores were in violation of the Act and that the Act was constitutional. The stores appealed, arguing, among other things, that the Act was so vague that it failed to give reasonable notice of the forbidden conduct and therefore violated the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, and that the Act violated the store's equal protection rights. Upon review, the court reversed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the Act was unconstitutionally vague and was not severable, so the entire Act had to fall on account of invalidity. The court found, however, that the stores did not carry their burden of establishing that the Act denied equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>

He asserted that his warrantless arrest in a motel was illegal, and that it tainted and made inadmissible his subsequent in-custody confession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of two charges of aggravated robbery, and he appealed. He asserted that his arrest without a warrant at his motel room was unconstitutional, and that the illegal arrest tainted and rendered inadmissible his later in-custody statement. The court reversed, holding that it mattered not that the motel room was not a permanent residence; as a registered guest at the motel, defendant was protected against unreasonable searches and seizures by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Thus, defendant's warrantless arrest was illegal. The court further noted that the state had the burden of proving that defendant's in-custody statement was voluntarily given. Applying three factors to determine whether the illegal arrest tainted the post-arrest incriminating statement, the court concluded that it had. The record showed that after defendant told detectives that he wanted a lawyer, he was interviewed further and gave the disputed confession. Having asked for an attorney, he should not have been interrogated further, unless he requested it. There was no proof that an intervening act of free will had removed the arrest's taint.</SPAN></P>

Defendants had filed petitions for permission to proceed in a circuit court for post-conviction relief pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 37. The court denied the petitions. Ark. R. Crim. P. 37 provided a remedy when a sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution of the United States or Arkansas. However, the grounds for relief that were presented by defendants were not so fundamental that it rendered a judgment void and opened to collateral attack. The court found the issues were considered waived because they were not raised within the controlling rules of procedure. Nonetheless, the court addressed defendants' arguments on the merits, and rejected them. Defendants' had properly waived their rights to have a jury impose a death penalty under Ark. R. Crim.

The court further held that although the policy was not in the record, the usual form of such a policy insured only the employer's liability as an employer, not as an individual. The court concluded that the insured's liability as an individual was discharged when his employee's claim was barred by limitations.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial judge erred in not disqualifying himself and in allowing defendant's confession into evidence, that Ark.

The court concluded that (1) despite the fact that the trial judge had prosecuted defendant in three of the four prior felony convictions relied on for the enhancement of punishment, the record showed that the trial was conducted in an impartial manner and there was no indication that any of the judge's rulings were the result of bias; (2) the trial court was correct in ruling &sect; 41-1004 was not unconstitutionally vague; (3) &sect; 41-1004 applied only where a firearm was used by a defendant in furtherance of the commission of a criminal offense; and (4) although the evidence was insufficient to support the finding that defendant violated &sect; 41-1004, there was no reason to reverse because sentence was not extended.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant householders and appellees, county, city, and emergency medical service provider, sought review of the decision of the Washington Chancery Court, Second Division (Arkansas), which held that an ordinance to provide emergency medical service to certain county residents for a $ 15 annual fee was constitutional but was invalid because it was not adopted in accordance with Act 51, 1979 Ark. Gen. Assembly, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 82-3410 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county passed an ordinance, ratified by a referendum, imposing a annual fee on each household for emergency medical services. The householders sought a restraining order, challenging the constitutionality of the ordinance and the legality of the fee. The trial court ruled that the ordinance was constitutional but that its adoption was procedurally flawed and it was invalid. On appeal, the court affirmed the constitutionality of the ordinance, but it reversed the finding that it was invalid due to improper adoption. The court ruled that two acts regarding the adoption of such ordinances were in conflict and that the procedures required under an act specifically addressing emergency medical services were required when proceeding under a more general county government act. The court found that the county substantially complied with the notice and hearing requirements and that the $ 15 fee was a charge for service and not a tax. The court concluded that, after the referendum, general requirements had to yield to support the election result and that the trial court erred in failing to place the burden of proving the ordinance invalid on the householders after the election.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the ordinance was constitutional and reversed the judgment that the ordinance was invalid, ruling that its adoption complied with procedural requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The student, a sixteen year old, was a sophomore in high school. He had missed his physical science class 14 times in one semester and was expelled. He went before the principal, superintendent and school board objecting to the decision. On appeal from the trial court's judgment, the student argued that the school board failed to follow its own rules and that the rules were vague, indefinite, unreasonable, and, therefore, unconstitutional. He contended that the rules only permitted his expulsion if he had missed 12 days, not 12 classes, and that the school officials wrongly expelled him. The court agreed with the trial court's disposition, holding the challenged rules obviously permitted the student's expulsion because he missed one course over 12 times and, for that reason he could not receive credit for the course, and was subject to expulsion. The court concluded it could not say that the school rules or their interpretation by school authorities were unconstitutionally vague or indefinite. Further, the trial court was not wrong in denying a writ of mandamus on such a discretionary matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The landowner was a partnership owned in part by a resident of Tennessee. The improvement district included acreage belonging to the landowner. After the petition was filed for establishment of the improvement district notice of the proposed district and a public hearing were made by publication in accordance with Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1001 (1980). The landowner did not learn about the proposed district until after the petition had been granted and the time for appeals provided in Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 21-1002 (1980) had expired. The landowner alleged that the notice by publication was void and unconstitutional as a violation of the right to due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court on appeal affirmed the order denying the landowner's motion to set aside the order creating the improvement district. Notice by certified mail would have been impractical because of the large number of landowners requiring notice. The court found that the United States Supreme Court had approved notice by publication in similar instances. The landowner failed to establish that notice by publication was not appropriate to the nature and circumstances of the case.</SPAN></P>

The court approved the jurisdiction of the circuit court to initially commit the prisoner, holding that the circuit court held jurisdiction of a person who had either been acquitted of criminal charges because of insanity or found to be incapable of assisting in their defense, and that such person, after commitment by the circuit court, could apply to the probate court for an adjudication of sanity and be released if he was then found sane.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) defendant voluntarily came out of his residence to talk with police officers and voluntarily spoke with them in a car; (2) there was no nonconsensual police conduct and no absence of probable cause; and (3) the statutes under which defendant was convicted were not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, a taxpayer and a state independent voters association, sought review of an order of the Chancery Court of Pulaski County, Fourth Division (Arkansas), which held that there was a specific appropriation to pay for equipment purchased by appellee Arkansas Department of Corrections from appellee equipment leasing corporation, pursuant to 1975 Ark. Acts 368, in an action by appellants challenging such appropriation by the Department.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Department leased printing equipment from the corporation. It later exercised its option to purchase. Appellants brought an action challenging the appropriation made by the Department to purchase the equipment, arguing that the appropriation was not sufficiently specific under Ark. Const. art. V, &sect; 29 and Ark. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 12. The court initially noted that the Department was authorized under 1975 Ark. Acts 368, &sect; 2 to spend for maintenance and general operation; the purpose of &sect; 2 was to pay for the Department's personal services and operating expenses. Further, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-338(F), which was part of the state general accounting and budgetary procedures law, provided that &quot;maintenance and general operations&quot; was one of six approved classification headings for appropriations; Art. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13-338(F)(2) further defined such heading to include equipment expenses. The court thus held that the Department's appropriation was a proper expenditure of funds. Further, Ark. Stat. Ann. &sect; 46-245 (1977) did not prohibit the use of tax revenues for the purchase of equipment under the Arkansas Prison-Made Goods Act of 1967, Ark. Stat.

None of the various issuing banks required the purchaser to designate the payees or owners in writing or to execute the signature card or any other written document in connection with the certificates of deposit. Prior to his death, the decedent went to the lockbox at his bank with one of his sons and withdrew the certificates of deposit. The lockbox was in the name of the decedent and his wife. The decedent gave the certificates of deposit to his son and stated they belonged to his brother and him. The son placed the certificates in a lockbox at another bank. The wife brought an action to determine the ownership of the certificates of deposit and the trial court held that the certificates were part of the decedent's estate, not a valid inter vivos gift. The court affirmed, holding that there was no valid inter vivos gift to the sons where there was no irrevocable delivery because the decedent still could have exercised control over the certificates by going to the issuing bank, even though the son had the keys to the lockbox.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the chancery court's property distribution by holding that the marital property act was not applicable to property owned as tenants by the entirety. As the automobile's ownership created a survivorship in personal property, it was properly treated under the entirety division statute. As the wife had substantially shared her wealth with her husband, she was entitled to an increase in the weekly child support.

The landowners filed an application with the city's planning commission to rezone the area to commercial. The commission denied the application. Upon judicial review, the chancery court found that the property involved was located in an established and expanding business district and that the city acted in an arbitrary and capricious or unreasonable manner in rejecting the landowners' application. On appeal, the court reasoned that zoning decisions of the city were legislative in nature and that the city had the power to plan various areas of the city into zones. The question before the chancellor was solely whether the city acted arbitrarily. Here, the decision of the chancellor that the property was adjacent to an existing and expanding business district was against the preponderance of the evidence. After reviewing all of the evidence, the court could not say that the city's actions were without a reasonable basis. Rezoning was not justified solely on the grounds that it was necessary to put a tract of land in its most remunerative use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The proposed construction project involved a new convention center and a hotel complex. The taxpayer argued that the project was unconstitutional because it resulted in a substantial deprivation of the taxpayers' money and property. Specifically, the taxpayer argued that the financial aid for the project was used for the advancement of private enterprise. The court affirmed the decision because the promoters that were building the hotel were doing it at their own expense. Furthermore, the court held that the city's issuance of revenue bonds was not unconstitutional. Neither the taxpayer nor the city would ever be required to pay any part of the bonds upon default.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Denial of the taxpayer's petition for declaratory judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Columbia Circuit Court (Arkansas), which convicted him of capital murder and sentenced him to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. The charge was that he was an accessory to the murder of an individual who was killed by defendant's wife. Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence. The court concluded that there was substantial evidence to have supported the jury's finding that defendant was an accomplice to the murder and that the murder was committed in the furtherance of two felonies, one to rob the victim and steal his vehicle and the other to break defendant out of jail. However, the court compared defendant's death sentence to his wife's sentence and all death sentence cases and reduced defendant's sentence of death to life imprisonment without parole. Defendant also contended that the trial court erred in forcing his wife to testify against him. The court held that the husband-wife privilege excluded only confidential communications and that the wife's testimony was not confidential because a witness testified that he overheard the conversation to which the wife testified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reduced defendant's sentence of death to life imprisonment without parole. Defendant's conviction was affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>
