</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant corporation challenged a decision of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), which declared Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 39369.5&nbsp;unconstitutional and negated the rights of the original sellers to purchase property from defendant school district. Plaintiff corporation filed a cross-appeal from the portion of the judgment holding that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to order defendant school district to sell the property to it.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant school district purchased property from previous owners, and thereafter found that it did not need the property. The previous owners entered into an option contract, whereby they would repurchase the property under their rights pursuant to Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 39369.5, and then resell the property to defendant corporation. Plaintiff corporation submitted the high bid and the previous owners attempted to exercise their repurchase rights. Plaintiff then filed an action before the trial court seeking an injunction, and judgment in its favor, contending that the previous owners' option was actually an assignment of rights and was unenforceable as in conflict with &sect; 39369.5. On appeal, the court held that the statute conferred a personal right on the previous owner and that an assignment would not be valid. The court held that because the option contract gave all of the previous owners' rights to defendant corporation, and defendant corporation was to provide the purchase money and pay all transfer and escrow costs, the option was an assignment, and therefore was not enforceable against defendant district. The court affirmed the decision voiding resale to the previous owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed the decision that defendant school district's agreement to resell property to the previous sellers was void, and directed trial court to order defendant district to hold a session for final acceptance. Defendant district could accept or reject plaintiff corporation's bid. While the statute was retroactive to previous sellers, their rights were personal and non-assignable, and their option to defendant corporation was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant estate executor sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), holding that Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 14009.5, 1981 Cal. Stat. 102, &sect; 101 (amended by 1981 Cal. Stat. 1163, &sect; 3) gave respondent Department of Health Services a claim to reimbursement for Medi-Cal benefits from an estate when the recipient died after the effective date of &sect; 14009.5 but benefits were received before the effective date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">A woman received Medi-Cal benefits while she was alive. When she died, appellant estate executor rejected respondent Department of Health Services' claim for reimbursement against the estate. The claim was made under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 14009.5, 1981 Cal. Stat. 102, &sect; 101 (amended by 1981 Cal. Stat. 1163, &sect; 3). Appellant maintained that only Medi-Cal benefits received after the effective date of the statute were subject to a claim for reimbursement. The trial court ruled that respondent had a right to reimbursement. Appellant sought review. The court affirmed. The court held that the interpretation of a statute by the officials charged with its application has to be given great weight. The court found that the legislature did not intend to make &sect; 14009.5 retroactive. But the court found that &sect; 14009.5 did not have any impermissible retroactive effect. Any right that the woman recipient had in the disposition of her estate was defined partially by the version of &sect; 14009.5 in effect at the time of her death. Furthermore, &sect; 14009.5 did not retroactively affect any existing rights held by the woman's estate because the estate did not come into existence until her death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Ruling against appellant estate executor and in favor of respondent Department of Health Services, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the application of the statute in question to estates that arose after its effective date did not affect any existing rights to benefits, and, therefore, the statute was prospective as intended and did not have any impermissible retroactive effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c5">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant, a building industry association, sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Ventura County (California), granting partial summary judgment in favor of respondent, the city of Camarillo, finding that Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 669.5 and Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 65863.6 did not apply to initiative ordinances, specifically Measure A, a growth ordinance enacted by the voters of respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Respondent, the City of Camarillo, enacted a growth ordinance known as Measure A, limiting the number of buildable lots. Measure A was enacted by the voters pursuant to their initiative power. Appellant, a building industry association, challenged the validity of Measure A. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court finding that Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 669.5 and Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 65863.6 did not apply to initiative actions. The court adopted the construction of &sect; 669.5 and &sect; 65863.6 that eliminated doubts as to the provisions' constitutionality. The court found that Measure A was an initiative ordinance and was not enacted by the &quot;governing body&quot; of respondent, as required in &sect; 669.5. The court also found that under &sect; 65863.6, what was in the minds of the electorate in adopting the initiative was immaterial. No one contended that the enactment of Measure A did not comply with the state initiative law, and if the legislature wanted zoning regulations adopted by initiative to go through the process specified in &sect; 65863.6, the initiative law was the place to specify this requirement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed the grant of partial summary judgment in favor of respondent, the city of Camarillo. Statutory provision that would have placed the burden of proof on respondent to show that a growth ordinance was necessary for the protection of the public health, safety, or welfare, was not applicable to an initiative ordinance, because it was approved by the voters and not enacted by the &quot;governing body&quot; of respondent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant challenged the decision of the Superior Court of Kern County (California), which convicted her willful cruelty or unjustifiable punishment of child, endangering life or health of a child in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 273a(1) and imposed a prison sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant and her boyfriend were charged with crimes stemming from her boyfriend's abuse of her son. The court affirmed appellant's conviction because the conduct required for a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;273a(1) was not that of intent, but rather of negligent omission to do something the surrounding circumstances would demand of a reasonable person. In this case, appellant allowed the abuse to happen. The court held that the defendant was on notice that she was charged with willfully permitting her child to be injured, as well as willfully allowing him to be endangered and she could be convicted on proof of willfully permitting specific incidents to occur or, in the alternative, of permitting the child's person and health to be endangered. The court held the charge involved required no proof of aiding or encouragement of the party directly inflicting the abuse. The court determined there were no instructional errors requiring reversal; however, it noted that juror confusion could be avoided if the two theories of criminal responsibility were better contrasted by separating the instructions into one series on purposeful conduct and one series on culpable negligence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant California State Franchise Board challenged a decision from the Superior Court of Los Angeles (California), which concluded appellee taxpayers were not liable for personal income tax assessments made by appellant and that Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff taxpayers filed an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against defendant California State Franchise Board alleging that defendant's personal income tax assessments against them were erroneous because they were not residents of California. The trial court granted judgment in favor of plaintiffs. Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Cal. Civ. Proc. &sect; 1060.50, which provided for declaratory and injunctive relief to challenge income tax assessments on the grounds of residency was constitutional. The court reasoned that under the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV nonresidents were entitled to substantive due process and that the anti-injunction provision of Cal. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 32 yielded to the paramount provisions of the United States Constitution. The court found plaintiffs were residents of Illinois because they had the closest connection to that state where they maintained a house in Illinois, and had substantial business and personal interests there. The court held plaintiffs did not engage in conduct that made them more than seasonal visitors to California.</SPAN></P>

This error was prejudicial, especially because the victim testified that she gave defendant money without his asking for it. The evidence that the victim's mouth touched defendant's penis was sufficient to support his conviction for forcible oral copulation. Although the trial court should have deleted the reference to force, violence, and fear of immediate bodily harm from the jury instruction on forcible oral copulation because they were inconsistent with the prosecution's theories, the error was harmless and the jury could not have been misled. The trial court could not avoid denying probation under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.065(a), and that statute's prohibition of probation was not cruel or unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that convicted defendant of extortion because the failure to instruct the jury on specific intent was reversible error, and it therefore vacated his sentence. The court affirmed otherwise, because there was sufficient evidence of forcible oral copulation and a statute required denial of probation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant city enacted a rent control program for mobile home parks. Under the programs, any increase in rents had to be approved by 51 percent of the homeowners in the park. If the homeowner's did not consent, compulsory arbitration was required before an independent arbitrator who was not connected to defendant. Either party could seek judicial review of the arbitrator's decision. Plaintiff mobile home park filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of defendant's program. The trial court entered judgment in favor of defendant. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that plaintiff was not required to exhaust its administrative remedies prior to bringing a claim of facial unconstitutionality. The court held that the adjustment mechanism provided in the rent control program was unconstitutional because it could result in unreasonable delay. The court recognized that a final decision could take over a year to be reached. The court also held that the program was unconstitutional because defendant retained no control over the program to assure that the policies and standards contained in the applicable ordinances were carried out.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff wife and defendant husband were divorced. Based on a court decision, the trial court determined that defendant's military pension was his separate property and not subject to division. Plaintiff contended that the Federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (Act), 10 U.S.C. &sect; 1408, should be applied retroactively. The Act provided that military retirement benefits could be deemed community property, subject to division. On appeal, the court reversed the decision. The divorce decree had to be modified to include a division of defendant's military retirement benefits. The divorce decree was entered during the interim period after the court decision and before the effective date of the Act.  Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 5124 specifically provided that the Act be given retroactive effect during the interim period. It was not Congress' intent to bar claims for community property interests just because the parties' divorce decrees were entered during the interim period.</SPAN></P>

Respondent gave notice to appellant's president and counsel of the hearing, but was told that they would not attend the hearing. The trial court approved the sale and transfer. Appellant argued that respondent's petition was insufficient as a matter of law to support the order and that it was denied due process because the lower court failed to stay its order under Cal.

The court affirmed, finding that the petition was sufficient to support the order and that appellant failed to demonstrate any omission, flaw, or viable alternative available to respondent. The court found that appellant was given adequate notice of the hearing and that appellant chose not to appear or request a continuance. Section 3101 did not provide an automatic stay, but rather a statute of limitations in which appellant may file an action. Cal. Fin.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Petitioner employee sought review of an order of respondent Public Employment Relations Board in an action that challenged the withholding of a portion of his paycheck as a service fee pursuant to the Educational Employment Relations Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 2540-3549.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Petitioner employee was employed be a school district but was not a member of a union. The collective bargaining agreement between the union and the school district required a service fee equal to union dues to be withheld from a nonmember's paycheck. Petitioner filed an unfair practice charge with respondent Public Employment Relations Board alleging that a portion of the service fee was spent of activities not directly related to negotiation, contract administration and grievance handling. After the board ruled against the majority of petitioner's claims, he filed a petition for writ of review. The court vacated the order of respondent. The court held that the union had the burden to prove what proportion of the expenditures went to activities that could properly be charged to a nonmember. The court held that a public school employee union could spend the fees for lobbying and to pay dues to national affiliates. The court held that the fees could not be spent for union organizing and recruiting activities or to publish materials that did not relate to bargaining with the employer. The court also held that the automatic deduction of fees from petitioner's paycheck was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court set aside the order of respondent Public Employment Relations Board and remanded the matter for a new hearing. Respondent improperly placed the burden of proving which union expenditures were not a proper use of the service fee on petitioner employee; service fee could be used for lobbying expenses and national affiliate dues but could not be used for union organizing and recruiting activities.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Respondent nonprofit religious corporation filed suit against appellant board of equalization which had imposed sales and use taxes on respondent's sale of its seminar syllabus and religious literature. After the trial court granted respondent a refund plus interest and denied respondent's motion to amend its complaint, both parties sought review. The court found that respondent was exempt from sales tax because the privilege of engaging in religious activity was guaranteed in the Constitution and respondent could not have been taxed for the privilege of doing that which it had the right to do. The court found that respondent was liable for use taxes because the tax was imposed on the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property. The court reversed and remanded on the amount of the use refund to which respondent was entitled because there was substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that respondent was a consumer rather than a retailer for use tax purposes.

The court held that, under the circumstances of its publication, defendant's article, including the headline and caption, were reasonably susceptible of a defamatory meaning and, thus, were libelous per se. Moreover, such article, headlines, and caption did not merely express defendant's opinion that plaintiff made statements about his son, but they falsely asserted as a fact that plaintiff made the statements. The dismissal of plaintiff's claim for false light invasion of privacy was proper, not because plaintiff failed to allege special damages as determined by the superior court, but because the claim was in effect a duplication of plaintiff's libel claim. Because the false light invasion of privacy claim was surplusage it was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Petitioner insured brought an action against real party in interest health insurer to contest a denial of benefits.

The court found that the information provided to petitioner in writing, in the form of a brochure and a certificate of insurance, and the oral representations of the agent differed as to the remedies available to petitioner to contest the denial of coverage. The court determined that the discrepancies created an ambiguity concerning procedures to contest denial of coverage that had to be resolved against real party in interest. The court concluded that the resolution of ambiguous information against real party in interest constituted a waiver of the right to arbitrate and that petitioner was entitled to have his action heard in a court of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Petitioner husband appeals from a judgment by the Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California), which awarded respondent wife, 43.65 percent community property interest in the part of his military disability retirement pension that would have been paid to him as longevity retirement benefits had he so elected and a monthly payment spousal support.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">In a divorce proceeding the trial court determined that a portion of the retirement benefits appellant husband could have received as longevity retirement pay was community property, awarding to respondent wife a 43.65 percent interest. The court affirmed holding that federal law did not prohibit the disposition ordered by the trial court in the circumstances of the case, where the military spouse retired before dissolution of the marriage and at the time he retired was eligible both for longevity and disability retirement and could have elected to receive longevity retirement benefits. The court held that in these circumstances the nonmilitary spouse had an interest in the retirement benefits recognized under both federal and state law which the military spouse could not destroy by his election to receive disability retirement benefits. Upon the condition that the foregoing judgment of affirmance became final, that part of the judgment awarding wife monthly spousal support was reversed for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed the judgement awarding wife a community property interest in the military retirement pension of husband holding that wife's rights were vested and the election of husband could not preempt her rights according to state law. The court reversed for further proceedings consistent with the opinion, the award of the monthly support on the condition that the foregoing judgment of affirmance became final.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant tenants sought review of the order that denied them damages, an injunction, and declaratory relief against respondent landlord. Appellants sought to sell their mobile home to a person with children. Respondent restricted tenancy in the mobile home park to adults only, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 798.76. Appellants argued that &sect; 798.76 was unconstitutional and was inconsistent with the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 51, prohibiting all arbitrary discrimination by businesses. The court affirmed the judgment and held that &sect; 798.76 was a later enacted specific statute that prevailed over &sect; 51, a general statute covering the same subject. The court held that &sect; 798.76 allowed respondent to limit its mobile home park to adults only, in plain clear language not susceptible to misunderstanding. The court held that this restriction did not violate appellants' right to housing because there was no fundamental right to housing. The court held that &sect; 798.76 was rationally related to the legitimate public purpose of assisting older citizens with their special housing needs and was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Petitioner criminal defendant sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent Municipal Court for the San Francisco Judicial District of the City and County of San Francisco (California), to consider her for a diversion program under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1001 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Petitioner criminal defendant was charged with misdemeanor and felony offenses. The felonies were reduced to misdemeanors but, when petitioner applied for diversion under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1001 et seq., the application was denied under prosecution guidelines that prohibited diversion for persons originally charged with felonies. Petitioner sought a writ of mandate to compel respondent trial court to consider her for diversion. The court first found that the guideline conflicted with the express terms of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 17(b)(5), which stated that a reduced misdemeanor was a misdemeanor for all purposes. The court also found that a prosecution-generated guideline, which absolutely precluded diversion for defendants originally charged with felonies that were reduced to misdemeanors, unlawfully impinged on the doctrine of separation of powers. Once a decision to charge was made, disposition of the case, whether through diversion or other means, was a judicial function, and the local prosecutor could not try to affect that authority by altering or mandating diversion eligibility. The writ of mandate was issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The writ of mandate was issued. The court held that the guideline under which petitioner criminal defendant's request for diversion was denied was invalid as being in conflict with controlling statutes and, to the extent it allowed the prosecutor to alter or mandate diversion eligibility, unlawfully impinged on the doctrine of separation of powers in violation of the California Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also admitted to the special circumstance and that he personally used a knife in the commission of the murder. Defendant was sentenced in accord with his plea bargain. On appeal, he urged that his conviction should be reversed and he be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because he was not adequately advised of the effect of his guilty plea on his right to appeal and that he should be able to withdraw his admission to the special circumstance because he was incorrectly advised of the elements of the special circumstance.

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 6210 et seq., established an Interest on Lawyer Trust Account Program or IOLTA for pooling nominal, short-term client trust funds to generate interest income for funding indigent legal programs. Respondent clients sued appellant State Bar of California, which adopted professional conduct rules pursuant to Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 6211, pertaining to the use of IOLTA accounts. The trial court held that the Act established a voluntary, not mandatory, program for depositing nominal, short-term client funds, whose interest supported indigent legal services. Appellant challenged the decision. The court reversed and held that the Act unambiguously created a mandatory program. Section 6211 was not unconstitutionally vague. The Act did not involve a taking of property prohibited by U. S. Const. amend. V. Nor were respondents denied equal protection because no fundamental interest was impinged by mandating that nominal, short-term deposits be placed in an unsegregated interest-bearing account. The Act was not a restriction upon legal services or a denial of respondents' right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected the constitutional issues raised by respondent clients.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned verdicts of guilty on all counts. On appeal, defendant made three contentions regarding the correctness of the instructions given to the jury on which it was to base its verdict on the first-degree murder charge. He argued that certain instructions, alternative theories of first-degree murder, should not have been given and that certain instructions, voluntary manslaughter, should have been. He also contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on premeditated first-degree murder. The court concluded that the trial court did not err.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Respondent landowner applied for a permit to build a single house residence on his beachfront property. Appellant state coastal commission granted the permit, with the condition that respondent set aside a portion of his land for public use. Respondent objected to the condition of the permit, and filed suit. The trial court found that the condition was an unconstitutional taking, and made in violation of state administrative law. Appellant challenged the ruling, and the court held that so long as a project contributed to the need for public access, even if the project standing alone had not created the need for access, and even if there was only an indirect relationship between the access exacted and the need to which the project contributed, imposition of an appellant's access condition on respondent's development permit was sufficiently related to burdens created by the project to be constitutional. The court stated that there was no unconstitutional taking, requiring that the public to bare the burden for the costs. The court also concluded that the permit was enacted in compliance with state administrative law and that it was valid. The court denied respondent attorneys fees.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the restriction, and denied respondent attorneys fees.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the order setting aside the information. The statute, which specified the circumstances in which a written statement could be used at a preliminary examination and set forth the rights and duties of the defense if the prosecution attempted to use such a written statement, was constitutional. It did not violate appellees' state or federal right of confrontation, right of due process, or privilege against self-incrimination, but rather was an attempt to rejuvenate the long-resolved contemporaneous cross-examination controversy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff arcade brought an action against defendant city, seeking an injunction to prevent the enforcement of an ordinance which limited installation of video games in the business district to four games or less. Defendant filed a cross-complaint, claiming that plaintiff's violation of the ordinance was a nuisance per se. The trial court found for defendant and permanently enjoined plaintiff from maintaining more than four video games on its premises. Plaintiff appealed from the decision. The court affirmed, holding that equal protection and due process rights were not violated because the ordinance was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The planning commission's resolution defining secondary use of video games as four games or less was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority by defendant, because there was no evidence that the decision to issue the certificate of occupancy by defendant was based on the planning commission's resolution. The ordinance was not void for vagueness because it was detailed. By failing to controvert defendant's allegation that plaintiff's use of 25 video games was a violation of the zoning ordinance, plaintiff admitted the violation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant bank sought review of an order by the Superior Court of Kern County (California) which increased the interest set pursuant to Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;685.010 on a judgment entered in favor of respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">In September 1979, a judgment was entered against appellant bank and interest on the judgment was set a 7 percent per annum from March 14, 1977, to the date of judgment. In September 1983, the interest was set to increase to 10 percent after September 1979. Appellant was partly successful in reducing the interest from the 10 percent demanded; however, this order was amended and the interest rate was increased to 10 percent after December 31, 1981. Appellant contended that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;685.010, which changed the interest rate from 7 to 10 percent, became effective on January 1, 1983. If so, the court should not have increased the rate to 10 percent on January 1, 1982. The court reversed and remanded the judgment for recalculation of interest on the judgment pursuant to the January 1, 1983, enactment date because the legislative history excluded the possibility that retroactive effect was intended. The preenactment opinion, an amended version of &sect;685.0101, a memorandum by the Attorney General's Officer, and an opinion by the legislative counsel all demonstrated that January 1, 1983, was the correct date and any mention to January 1, 1982, was an oversight.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The trial court's judgment increasing the interest on the judgment entered against appellant was reversed and remanded for recalculation because retroactive effect of a statute regarding an increase in judgment interest was not intended to be retroactive to January 1, 1982.</SPAN></P>

The California Supreme Court determined that a life prisoner such as petitioner needed to be considered for parole release under the administrative guidelines of the ISL in effect at the time of the sentence, and under the regulations of the DSL. The state began to hold so-called Stanworth hearings for parole release date determinations for life prisoners convicted under the ISL.

On appeal, appellant urged three grounds for reversal. First, appellant claimed that his confession to a fellow inmate while incarcerated at the county jail was received into evidence in violation of due process because the inmate may have been a police informant. Second, appellant claimed that it was error for the trial court to discharge a regular juror and replace her with an alternate during the sanity phase of appellant's trial. Third, appellant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing a jury instruction which outlined appellant's possible institutionalization if found not guilty by reason of insanity. The court affirmed the judgment of conviction, but reversed the sanity determination and ordered it to be retried. Appellant's sanity proceedings may have been prejudiced by the trial court's refusal to instruct the jury on the consequences of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted judgment in favor of defendants. The appellate court affirmed and ruled that plaintiffs failed to prove an illegal expenditure of public funds. The court held that the trial court adequately resolved all controverted issues against plaintiffs and that the manner of arrests reflected practices and policies that guarded against acting without probable cause.

The court held the statute did not infringe on the right to work because it did not prevent anyone from practicing their profession and did not it make it more difficult for one to obtain a license needed to practice a profession; at worst, the impact of the statute was very indirect, collateral and marginal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellants, taxpayer and attorney, filed suit requesting declarative and injunctive relief, asserting that the municipal ordinance regulating escort services was unconstitutional and void on its face. The trial court summarily denied appellants' application for preliminary injunction. Because the validity of the challenged regulation presented only questions of law, it was therefore appropriate for the court to resolve the merits of the action. In so doing, the court reversed the trial court's decision and held that the escort service ordinance was invalid because it was in conflict with general laws in violation of Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7. The court concluded that there was no suggestion that, in either the police captain's analysis or the legislative history of the ordinance, there was a legislative purpose other than to control prostitution and aid in police investigation of that crime. The court ruled that the ordinance clearly had the substance of a penal statute and impermissibly attempted to expand police investigative powers beyond that encompassed in the California Penal Code.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant was convicted of murder and kidnapping for the purpose of robbery.

The court reversed the conviction for kidnapping for the purpose of robbery and the finding of the special circumstance that the murder was committed in connection with a kidnapping because the asportation of the victim did not amount to kidnapping and therefore, the finding was not supported by the record. The court held that the deletion of the finding on the second special circumstance did not require reversal or modification of the sentence imposed for murder because a single special circumstance, alleged and found true, was sufficient to support defendant's sentence. The court found that the jury was properly instructed that before it could find the first special circumstance to be true, it had to find that defendant had the intent to kill and that the jury made such finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant was convicted of committing lewd or lascivious acts upon a child under 14 years old. The trial court sentenced defendant to prison and ordered him to pay a restitution fine pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 13967. Defendant sought review of the judgement. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in imposing the restitution fine without considering his ability to pay. The California legislature enacted several laws which operated to require trial courts to impose a &quot;restitution fine&quot; on persons convicted of any crime. Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 13967 provided a structure for the trial courts to impose various levels of restitution. Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1202.4 was also amended to revise restitution provisions. Defendant argued that, were the mandatory language of &sect; 1202.4 (a) given full effect, it would be unconstitutional. The court found defendant's contention unmeritorious and affirmed the judgment. The statute in the government code was different from that in the penal code in several respects and defendant's financial position was not required to be considered under &sect; 13967.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Respondent hospital corporation obtained a preliminary injunction to restrain picketing by appellant hospital workers' union and prohibit language that was insulting, offensive, rude, coercive, or obscene against respondents and persons wishing to do business with the hospital. On review, appellants contended that the language of the injunction was overbroad and unconstitutionally prohibited the exercise of protected rights under U.S. Const. amend I. The court held that freedom of speech meant the right to discuss publicly all matters of public concern without prior restraint or fear of punishment. In the context of labor, any restrictions on picketing had to be couched in the narrowest terms that would accomplish the pin-pointed objective. The court pointed out that not all speech was constitutionally protected. It distinguished between political statements couched in vulgar terms and unprotected obscene expressions that deal with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interests. The court held that the language respondent complained of had no political content. In affirming the trial court, the court held that the injunction was sufficiently precise as to the prohibited speech.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 1202.4), contending restitution fine was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant pleaded guilty to 11 counts of forgery. In addition to a prison sentence, the trial judge imposed a fine payable to the state restitution fund on count 1 (Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1202.4). Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the restitution fine. The court affirmed appellant's sentence. The language of section 1202.4 belied appellant's claim of vagueness. It required the judge to impose on a person convicted of a felony a restitution fine as provided in Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 13967. The court rejected appellant's challenge based on the statute's lack of provisions to enforce her payment. These provisions were found in other statutes. It also rejected appellant's contention that the provision for imposition of the restitution fine regardless of a defendant's present ability to pay constituted an invidious discrimination on the basis of wealth in violation of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Imprisonment of a defendant for failure to pay the restitution fine was prohibited (Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1205.5) and appellant failed to show that imposition of a restitution fine otherwise violated equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed appellant's sentence. The statute providing for the restitution fine was not vague and it did not constitute discrimination on the basis of wealth in violation of appellant's rights to equal protection because she could not be imprisoned for failure to pay the fine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">After abducting and assaulting two victims, defendant was convicted of forcible rape under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 261(2), forcible oral copulation in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288a(c), kidnapping in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 207, a lewd and lascivious act upon a child in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288(b), and sodomy by force with a child in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 286(c). Defendant appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that Proposition 8, Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(d), dealing with rulings on the admissibility of evidence, had no effect upon Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1112, which prohibited a trial court from ordering a psychiatric examination of sexual assault victims. The court found that the trial court's refusal to order a psychiatric examination of a witness was not tantamount to a Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(d), ruling on the admissibility of evidence which would be generated as a result of that examination. It found that a motion to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity was not timely when the motion was first made after the rendition of a jury verdict; no case law supported defendant's request to change his plea after the verdict.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed defendant's convictions because the trial court did not rule on the admissibility of any evidence when it refused to order a psychiatric examination of a victim, and defendant's motion to change his plea to one of insanity was untimely because it was made after the guilty verdict and after the trial court had denied his motion for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the lower court erred in failing to exercise its discretion in ruling upon defendant's motion requesting it to order a psychiatric examination of one of the victims. The court held that Cal.

The court also held that defendant's counsel was not required to explore defendant's mental condition where there was no reason to suspect that an emotion or mental condition may have affected defendant's conduct.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant was charged with health code violations. The court set a trial confirmation hearing date and a trial date. Appellant surety posted defendant's bail. Prior to the trial confirmation hearing, defendant's counsel moved to set aside the information. The lower court forfeited defendant's bail because he did not appear. Appellant moved to vacate forfeiture and exonerate bond on grounds that the court had no jurisdiction to order bail forfeiture under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1305 (&sect; 1305). Appellant sought review of an adverse summary judgment. The court found that under &sect; 1305, a court had authority to forfeit bail if defendant failed to appear for arraignment, trial, judgment, execution of judgment, or when his presence was otherwise lawfully required without sufficient excuse. Defendant's presence at the hearing on his motion to set aside was not a court-ordered appearance date. Any appearance obligation arose from his contractual relationship with appellant. Cal. Penal Code &sect; 997 requiring defendants' presence at all proceedings was to protect defendant's due process rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant charged respondent with possession of cocaine, driving under the influence of alcohol, driving with 0.10 percent blood alcohol, and resisting a public officer in performing his duties. The court reversed the order that dismissed these charges. The superior court incorrectly determined that respondent's misdemeanor arrest under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 836(1) did not occur within a reasonable time after the police officer observed the offenses because less than 15 minutes had intervened. The superior court incorrectly held that the warrantless arrest was improper. The court held that it was constitutionally valid because the officer had probable cause to believe that respondent committed an offense while under the influence of alcohol and the arrest was made pursuant to the exigent circumstances relative to the need to preserve the blood-alcohol evidence. The court ruled that even if this warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor occurred inside respondent's home, it was proper because the officer's entry was justified on the theory of hot pursuit to prevent the dissipation or destruction of evidence. The superior court incorrectly granted respondent's motion to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant claimant was awarded medical expenses, damages, and future medical expenses by a jury in her medical malpractice suit against respondent health care providers.

The court summarily rejected appellant's equal protection argument where it found that the lower courts generally lost unrestricted power to change a judgment once it had been entered, unless statutorily authorized. While &sect; 667.7 provided for periodic payments of future medical expenses damages of $ 50,000 or more, it did not expressly give the lower court the right to amend the judgment after it had been entered and the action was no longer pending. A party's request for periodic payment of future damages had to be made prior to entry of judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant former wife left her marriage home with her two children without respondent former husband's knowledge in early 1971 or 1972. In July 1977, respondent signed an order for support by stipulation with the district attorney and agreed to monthly child support payments and arrearage. Appellant kept the whereabouts of the children away from respondent and did not allow visitation during this period of time. In 1983, a trial court ruled that appellant had actively sought to conceal the whereabouts of the minor children of the parties from 1972 to the present time and she was estopped from recovering child support payments for that period. The court found that a judgment for child support entered into as a result of an agreement between the district attorney and a parent not represented by counsel was voidable if the parent established that he was not advised of his right to trial and would not have otherwise executed the agreement. Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment denying the writ of execution for child support because respondent met this burden.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The trial court's order denying a writ of execution for child support was affirmed because respondent former husband had no counsel and did not understand the ramifications when he signed the order for support by stipulation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant was convicted of two counts of rape, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 261(2), two counts of forcible oral copulation, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288a (c), and one count of assault with a deadly weapon, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 245 (a). At the outset of trial, defendant admitted a prior serious felony conviction, for which he received a five-year enhancement. Enhancements were also imposed for a prior felony and use of a deadly weapon. The court sentenced defendant to a total of 21 years, including full consecutive sentences for the two acts of forcible oral copulation. On appeal, the court held that the interruption between the two acts of rape was sufficient to constitute separate offenses within the meaning of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.6(d) and warrant full consecutive sentences. The court also held that assault with a deadly weapon was not a serious felony under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1192.7(c)(23) and thus, the five-year enhancement had to be reversed. The judgment as to the remaining enhancements was also reversed and remanded for the court to exercise its discretion to strike them. In all other respects the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The judgment of conviction for rape, oral copulation, and assault with a deadly weapon was reversed as to a five-year enhancement, as the assault with a deadly weapon offense was not a serious felony under the controlling statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff indigents sought injunctive relief after defendants, county and county board, reduced general assistance grant levels. Plaintiffs argued that the assistance termination procedure violated due process. The trial court denied plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction, but did not rule on plaintiffs' due process challenge, and plaintiffs' appealed. The court held that it was arbitrary and capricious for defendants to reduce the grant levels without a factual determination of their minimum subsistence needs because the determination was necessary to satisfy the statutory mandate in Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 17000, that defendants relieve and support their indigent residents. The court held that the due process argument was not precluded by untimely filed notices of appeal because it was reasonably clear what plaintiffs were trying to appeal from, and defendants were not misled or prejudiced by the notices. The court held that defendants' two-day limitation on filing a request for a hearing on the termination of general assistance was insufficient notice and violated the due process requirements of Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff male customer appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County (California) in favor of defendant businesses in plaintiff's civil rights action.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff male customer filed a civil rights suit against defendant businesses alleging that they violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Act), Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 51, by offering gender-based price discounts. The trial ruled in favor of defendants, finding that &quot;Ladies Day&quot; promotions were simply intended to encourage women to patronize defendants' establishments and that there was no showing that the prices paid by men were arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair. Plaintiff appealed. The appeals court affirmed, finding no per se violation. The court ruled that the Act only prohibited arbitrary discrimination. The court noted that there was no discrimination involving defendant car washes because they all allowed an identical discount to men and women on different days of the week. Moreover, there was ample evidence to demonstrate that the discounts served an independent business purpose. The court noted evidence that more, not fewer, men attended defendant nightclub on the nights women were offered free admission. Thus, because the price schemes were not designed to and did not discourage a segment of the population from patronizing defendants' establishments, they did not violate the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The state appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County (California) dismissing a petition that charged defendant juvenile with possession of LSD after defendant's motion to suppress the contraband was granted. The state argued that the detention for suspicion of truancy was proper, and hence the evidence was properly seized during a pat-down search.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant juvenile was stopped by police while walking on a sidewalk at 10:30 a.m. because the police believed him to be truant from school. Police discovered LSD in defendant's possession during a pat-down search. The state brought a juvenile proceeding against defendant, charging him with possession of LSD. The trial court dismissed the petition after granting defendant's motion to suppress. The state appealed. The appeals court affirmed. The court ruled that truancy stops based on mere suspicion or even probable cause did not permissibly fit into the mixed bag of &quot;proper reasons&quot; or &quot;innumerable miscellaneous tasks&quot; police officers are authorized and expected to perform, nor could they be justified on some statutory ground. The court further ruled that there is no lawful basis for a police detention for truancy on other than actual knowledge of a student's truant status before the encounter. Thus, because the police in this case acted only to investigate garden variety truancy, rather than actual truancy, the detention was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The appeals court affirmed the dismissal of the petition charging defendant juvenile with possession of LSD. The court ruled that because an improper sidewalk detention for suspicion of truancy led to the search and seizure of evidence from defendant's person, the motion to suppress was properly granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant was convicted of pandering in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 266i and was sentenced to probation. The state appealed the probation sentence. The court concluded that because the effect of the trial court's order was to modify the verdict by reducing the statutorily required punishment, the order was appealable under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1238(a)(6). The state contended the trial court had erred in determining that a three-year minimum state prison confinement was unconstitutional because it constituted cruel or unusual punishment. The court concluded that the three-year minimum prison term for pandering did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment. The court held that the trial court had exceeded its authority in substituting its judgment for that of the legislature as to the appropriateness of the mandatory three-year length of imprisonment. The court affirmed the order granting probation, because to resentence defendant to a three year prison term under the challenged law, under the unique circumstances of the case, would be unnecessarily harsh.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The people appealed the decision of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which granted defendant's motions to suppress evidence found in a warrantless search under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5, and to dismiss charges of possession of cocaine under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11350, possession of marijuana for sale under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11359, and possession of a firearm under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant was arrested after police seized marijuana, cocaine, and a gun from a briefcase that was located between defendant and another man in the front seat of a car. Defendant was charged with possession of cocaine under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11350, possession of marijuana for sale under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11359, and possession of a firearm by a felon under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence, which the trial court granted and dismissed the case. The court held that under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(d), the exclusion of evidence in California conformed to federal practices that held that a court could not suppress evidence unless a defendant showed a personal, reasonable, and legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched or the evidence seized. The court found that defendant made no such showing and, therefore, reversed the trial court's decision to grant the motion. The court also held that the exclusion of evidence did not implicate defendant's constitutional right against self-incrimination or his rights to a fair trial because he needed only establish that an illegal search invaded his own expectation of privacy.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that &sect; 6211(a) was all inclusive, and clear and unambiguous in that it required nominal or short-term deposits of client trust funds to be placed in an interest-bearing trust account and any interest earned to be used to fund designated, specified legal services. The court held that &sect; 6211(a) was intended to be mandatory. The court held that &sect; 6211(a) was not unconstitutionally vague because it permitted appellant with approval of the supreme court to formulate and enforce rules of professional conduct pertaining to use of client funds. The court held that &sect; 6211(a) was not a violation of U.S. Const. amend.

After a market study, appellant decided to grant a franchise of the same line-make to a prospect over 15 miles away from respondent franchisee's place of business. Respondent franchisee filed a protest with respondent board, which adopted the ruling that the prospective franchise appointment constituted a modification of respondent franchisee's agreement without good cause. The trial court denied appellant's petition. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court with directions to issue a writ of mandate. Respondent board acted in excess of its jurisdiction and erred in allowing the protest. The proposed dealership was outside of the relevant market defined in Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 3062, which limited the right of an existing franchisee to object to the appointment of a new dealer to a 10-mile radius. The appointment of a new dealership did not constitute a modification of the existing agreement.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11351. The trial court instructed the jury that it was unlawful to possess a controlled substance such as cocaine for sale. The people's chemical evidence showed only that the substance was simply cocaine. This led the jury to presuppose that the controlled substance statute regulated a discrete substance called cocaine, which was the substance possessed by defendants. The presupposition was false. Defendants requested an instruction that informed the jury that only one form of cocaine, l-cocaine, was a controlled substance. The trial court refused to give the instruction. On appeal the court reversed the convictions as a result of the trial court's failure to give the jury defendants' requested instruction. The court found that as a consequence, an element of the offense was effectively removed from jury consideration and proof by the people and was, therefore, reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant was convicted of one count of robbery in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211. Appellant was then sentenced to a prison term of 10 years. The trial court sentenced appellant to five years for the robbery and to two five year enhancements, which the trial court then ran concurrently instead of consecutively. Appellant challenged his conviction and sentence. The court affirmed the conviction and held that there was no ex post facto application when additional terms of punishment under the enhancement provision of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667 were imposed, so appellant was not exposed to double jeopardy, and appellant was not denied equal protection. The court, however, held that the trial court erred when it ordered the two five year terms to run concurrently because the electorate had indicated with sufficient clarity that the mandatory provisions of &sect; 667 were not subject to judicial discretion pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1385. Therefore the court ordered that appellant's sentence was to be modified to reflect consecutively imposed enhancements, which made appellant's sentence 15 years instead of the original 10.</SPAN></P>

Decedent's estate filed a complaint for damages against appellant for wrongful death. Appellants cross-complained against each other. The trial court found that federal maritime law governed, and that maritime law precluded a cross-action for indemnity by third party tortfeasors against an employer who paid benefits pursuant to the Federal Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C.S. &sect; 901 et seq. On review, the court found that because the barge upon which the accident occurred was not upon navigable water, the trial court erred in determining that maritime law governed all aspects of the case. However, the court still found that LHWCA was applicable. Accordingly, the court found that because of the exclusiveness of LHWCA, there could not an action against a maritime employer based upon its alleged negligence as a basis for contribution.

Rejecting plaintiffs' argument that the trial court should have granted their request for a preliminary injunction, the court noted that the trial court correctly concluded that plaintiffs were not likely to prevail on the merits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff property taxpayers were part of a class that challenged the constitutionality of Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 5151. Under that section, the state paid interest to property owners who had their property reduced in assessed value. However, it was limited to those that earned $ 10 or more in interest. Plaintiffs earned less. The trial court granted defendants taxing agencies' motion for summary judgment. The court of appeals affirmed, rejecting plaintiffs' equal protection argument. Plaintiffs bore a heavy burden on establishing the unconstitutionality of a taxing classification. States were provided latitude in this area in order to promote convenience and the legitimate interest in collecting taxes. By setting a level at $ 10, the state was promoting administrative efficiency by not having to send a refund to those who earned miniscule interest. Nor was there any due process violation. U.S. Const. amend. V did not guarantee the right to judicial review of tax liability before payment. Plaintiffs had notice and an opportunity to be heard because they were provided hearings which resulted in refunds. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that defendant's extrajudicial statements could support a charge of special circumstances. The court found that the trial court's deferral of the cross-examination was harmless error, as the defense was based on the psychiatrist's testimony that defendant suffered from diminished capacity, and the witness would have been called regardless of defendant's testimony.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant was convicted of robbery in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211, with use of a knife in the commission of the crime, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022(b). Defendant was sentenced to state prison for three years, plus an additional one-year enhancement for the weapon use. Defendant was given credit for days of presentence custody and conduct credit. Defendant challenged the conviction and sentence on the grounds that the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to grant defendant a continuance to secure attendance of a witness and the court miscalculated his custody credits. The court affirmed the conviction, but modified the sentence. The court held that the defendant did not meet any of the requirements to warrant grant of continuance. Balancing the benefit which defendant purported to anticipate against the likelihood that such benefit would result, the trial court was well within its discretion in denying the continuance. Also, the court found that defendant was not eligible for benefits of programs in which he did not participate, but his sentence credit incorrectly calculated. The sentence was modified to reflect the correct days for which defendant deserved credit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The judgment was modified so that defendant was provided with more days of credit for behavior because the court incorrectly computed the credits he should have been awarded. The judgment was otherwise affirmed because the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's claim of error.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected appellant's argument the rulings violated due process rights, equal protection rights, the right to compulsory process, and unconstitutionally relieved the prosecution of its burden of proving all elements of the offenses. The court held that the restrictions imposed by the statutes were constitutional public policy determinations that eliminated capacity evidence and did not preclude appellant from presenting his defense.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">After respondent Board of Pharmacy found mistakes in its audit of dangerous drugs in the records appellant licensed pharmacist and pharmacy kept, it imposed a three-year probation for negligence. Appellant sought review of the superior court's refusal to issue a writ of mandate against respondent's order. Affirming the decision, the court found sufficient evidence of negligent failure of security with an outside theft that appellants failed to report to respondent as the law required, and repeated thefts by employees. The court did not pass on the constitutionality of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11208 because there was sufficient independent evidence of guilt. Rejecting appellants' U.S. Const. amend XIV argument, the court said equal protection rights were not offended because the legislature could have reasonably believed that a pharmacist was more capable of safeguarding the drugs. The court added that under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code 4350.5, disciplinary repercussion could have flowed from violations of federal law. Finally, the court found no prejudice from respondent's refusal to admit the results of polygraph tests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant was convicted of unlawfully taking salmon and striped bass by use of a gillnet, Cal. Fish &amp; Game Code &sect; 8685.5, and possessing those illegally taken fish for sale, Cal. Fish &amp; Game Code &sect; 8685.6. Defendant appealed his conviction and claimed that because the statutes did not define &quot;gill net&quot;, they were unconstitutionally vague. The court affirmed and held that though the Fish and Game Code did not specifically define gill net, &sect;&sect; 8685.5, 8685.6 were not invalidated under the void-for-vagueness doctrine because the term gill net had a long established and commonly accepted meaning that provided fair warning. The court found that &sect;&sect; 8685.5, 8685.6 were also not unconstitutionally vague because defendant's conduct was squarely encompassed within a reasonable and practical construction of the term. The court determined that one of ordinary intelligence having fair notice of the species of fish protected, and of the prohibited method of taking them, would in the exercise of common sense have fair warning that use of certain nets might result in the forbidden taking of those fish by that method.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant appealed his conviction for receiving stolen property in the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), on the basis that a search of his home violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(d). Defendant contended that the evidence against him should have been suppressed because the affidavit that supported the search warrant did not contain probable cause, and included deliberate misrepresentations and omissions, which misled the magistrate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant's home was searched pursuant to a warrant issued upon a police sergeant's affidavit, which was based on information by two identified informants. Defendant pled guilty to receiving stolen property, but preserved for appeal objections to the search of his home. The court affirmed defendant's conviction because the police sergeant believed in good faith that the search warrant was based on probable cause when it was issued. The court ruled that because Cal. Const. art. I., &sect; 28(d) required federal rather than state constitutional law to be applied to resolve questions of admissibility of illegally seized evidence, the test whether police possessed an objectively reasonable belief in the validity of the warrant applied to defendant's case retroactively. The court found that the police sergeant had no reason to believe that his statement was false or that he acted in reckless disregard of the truth, that there was no evidence of misrepresentation or omission in his affidavit, and that there was no basis to find that the magistrate had been misled. The court ruled that suppression of the seized evidence was not warranted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed defendant's conviction because the police sergeant who swore out the affidavit used to search defendant's home had a good-faith belief that the information in his affidavit was true, and the affidavit did not mislead the magistrate. The court held that the state's constitution required application of federal exclusionary law, including the good-faith exception, and there was no rational basis to suppress the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's order of denial because it found that there was no reasonable basis for the denial of the motion, as the requirements of &sect; 1021.5 had been met. The court held that petitioners were successful parties because judgment was entered in their favor on all but one issue and they obtained a peremptory writ. The court found that petitioners' action vindicated important rights affecting the public interest because it enforced the fundamental right of free expression guaranteed by the state and federal constitution. The claim was found to confer a significant benefit on the public because all students would ultimately benefit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Two witnesses observed appellant as he left the scene of an attempted residential burglary. Appellant later admitted the offense. Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant entered a plea of guilty to attempted burglary and admitted three of the four alleged prior serious felony convictions. The trial court sentenced appellant accordingly. On appeal, the court held that appellant's prior criminal convictions could be used to enhance his sentence. The court applied Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667(a), which permitted sentence enhancement for a person convicted of a serious felony who previously had been convicted of a serious felony. Because appellant was convicted of attempted burglary, which was a serious felony, and had been previously convicted, the court held that the sentence was not impermissibly long. The court further held that the application of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667 did not violate ex post facto rules. Lastly, the court held that appellant's sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment because the sentence imposed included permissible enhancement for appellant's prior serious felony convictions. Judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The facts showed that plaintiff was dismissed in 1950, the decision finding the loyalty oath unconstitutional occurred in 1967, plaintiff first requested reinstatement in 1967, her last request for reinstatement was in 1976, and the claim was not filed until 1981. The court held that a cause of action for refusal to reinstate accrued on the date the request for reinstatement was denied. The court found plaintiff's cause of action was not ongoing because the concept of continuing breach was not applicable, and even if the last date for accrual was in 1976, the last day for filing an action on a breach of contract claim would have been in 1980.

The trial court denied defendant's motion. Defendant then pleaded nolo contendere to a misdemeanor violation of sale of a controlled substance, and was sentenced to probation. On appeal, the court examined whether defendant had the vicarious right to assert the illegality of the third person's detention and the seizure of the marijuana. The prosecution contended that, pursuant to Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28, all relevant evidence was admissible in defendant's criminal proceeding that was not violative of federal constitutional directions. The court stated that defendant could only challenge a violation of his own reasonable expectation of privacy. Therefore, the court held that defendant could not assert the illegality of the third party's detention and seizure.

On appeal, defendant contended that the jury instructions were erroneous, that the crime of murder by torture as defined by the trial court was unconstitutionally vague, that statements made to an inmate violated his rights pursuant to U.S. Const. amend. VI, that his decision not to testify was based on a mistaken belief that he would be susceptible to impeachment by his prior felony convictions, that he was denied an opportunity to present a complete defense, that the special circumstances findings required reversal, and that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">In 1976, pursuant to a plea agreement, defendant pled guilty to assault with a deadly weapon, Cal.

In reversing the prior &quot;serious felony&quot; finding, the court interpreted &sect; 1192.7(c)(23), which provided a list of serious felonies, to mean a prior felony in which an enhancement for use of a deadly or dangerous weapon was found to be true. The court then ruled that, because &sect; 667 was first enacted in 1977 and defendant's prior conviction in 1976 was not accompanied by enhancement, that conviction was not a &quot;serious felony.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 5600 et seq. The court affirmed the writ as modified and held that it was properly issued because it was an abuse of discretion for the state board of control to partially disapprove plaintiffs' concededly valid claims under Cal.

The court held that if any part of the Short-Doyle appropriation remained unexhausted at the time the trial court entered its order, it was &quot;available&quot; for satisfaction of a prior Short-Doyle encumbrance within the meaning of &sect; 16304.1. The court modified the judgment so that recourse could have been had to any unexpended, unencumbered funds that remained in subsequent appropriations. The court held that Cal.

On appeal, appellants maintained that respondents lacked standing, that a private nonprofit religious corporation was not a business establishment, and that regulation of the content of the directory violated appellants' rights to freedom of speech, religion, and association. The court held that having alleged that they have been damaged by appellants' refusal, respondents had standing. The court affirmed the lower court's order that enjoined appellants' discriminatory business practices against respondents as the order did not unconstitutionally impair protected freedoms.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Respondent wife purchased a house before marrying appellant husband. After marriage, the house became the family residence and payments on first and second trust deed loans were made from community funds. Respondent later recorded a deed conveying the property to herself and appellant as joint tenants. Based on respondent's testimony in proceedings to dissolve the marriage, the trial court held that the presumption raised by the joint tenancy deed was overcome by evidence of an oral understanding or agreement that the property was to remain respondent's separate property. The trial court ordered respondent to pay appellant an amount equal to the reduction in principal from the date of the marriage to the date of separation. On appeal, the court agreed with appellant that the trial court erred in failing to retroactively apply Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.1 and 4800.2 governing joint tenancy deeds to husband to wife during marriage. However, because there was no change in the property's fair market value between the dates of marriage and separation, the court found, the trial court reached the proper result, albeit for improper reasons.

The court found that the grant or refusal of a preliminary injunction was within the discretion of the trial court and its order could be reversed only if abuse of discretion was shown.

The trial court determined that it was probable that respondent would ultimately prevail and issued the preliminary injunction. The declarations showed that respondent's deterrent system was based on the concept that a horn sounding and light flashing within the building would frighten an intruder away.

Defendant was not entitled to any specific appointed attorney. Defendant's Hitch motion was properly denied because the physical evidence destroyed was not material to defendant's defense. The evidence contained no fingerprints or other identifying marks implicating or exculpating defendant. Despite the fact that Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant pled guilty to two counts of robbery by use of a firearm. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in denying his Cal.

The photograph was used as evidence against defendant in the trial court action. Defendant argued that because the search warrant was invalidated, the photograph and other fruits that led to his conviction should have been suppressed and that the absence of such evidence required dismissal of the charges against him. The state argued that defendant's subsequent crimes had removed the taint from the evidence obtained as a result of unlawful police conduct. The reviewing court agreed, holding that the passage of time and defendant's subsequent crimes attenuated the unlawfulness of the police search.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant juvenile was adjudicated a ward of the court and committed to a youth facility following juvenile delinquency proceedings. Before proceedings began, defendant moved to suppress a photograph of him and his girlfriend that was obtained during a search of her apartment. Another resident of the apartment had consented to the search. The trial court denied the motion to suppress and also denied defendant's motion for a jury trial. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that the motion to suppress was properly denied because the state showed that permission to search was obtained from a third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected. The court next addressed the denial of defendant's request for a jury trial. The court acknowledged that under the In re Daedler case there was no constitutional right to a jury trial in wardship type proceedings such as this and that stare decisis bound it to uphold this decision. However, the court undertook an extensive and thorough historical review of the juvenile justice system in an effort to convince the higher court to revisit the issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant elected official filed statements of contest challenging election results on grounds of election officials' misconduct and illegal voting. The trial court confirmed passage of the incorporation measure, and the election of challenged respondent city officials. Appellant argued that absentee ballots were illegal and void due to voter fraud and misconduct of election officials. Appellant argued that loss of secrecy resulted from improper procedures used in obtaining and returning ballots. The court reversed confirmation of election results and held that Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 1013 prohibited a third party's manual delivery of absentee ballots to the county clerk. The court held that &sect; 1013's requirement of personal delivery preserved secrecy, uniformity, and integrity of the voting process. The court held that presence of campaign workers, one of whom was a candidate on the ballot, constituted an unlawful intrusion upon the secret ballot guarantee. The court held remanded the case with directions to the trial court to identify and determine which ballots should be voided, followed by a declaration of the results of the elections discounting the voided ballots.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's order confirming election results because delivery of absentee ballots by a third person to the city clerk was a clear violation of statutory elections law.

The trial court found that appellant had an understanding that the house was respondent's separate property, and an interlocutory judgment to that effect was entered.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant strangled the victim with his hands. In order to make sure that the victim was dead, defendant tightened a rope around victim's neck and also stomped on victim's neck. Defendant then took victim's wallet and shirt, and left victim's body in a desolate area. A jury convicted defendant of first degree murder on theories that the murder was either premeditated or was by torture. Defendant contended on appeal that the evidence of premeditation and torture was insufficient, that the trial court provided confusing and erroneous instructions to the jury, and that the trial court erred in admitting a tape recording of defendant's statements made to the police and letters sent to defendant in jail into evidence. The court rejected defendant's contentions and affirmed the conviction. The court ruled that the evidence established defendant acted with premeditation, that the manner of killing was particular and exacting, and that the evidence substantiated a finding of torture murder. The court ruled that the jury instructions were appropriate and that defendant's evidentiary claims were either waived or harmless error.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Petitioner inmate was the inmate editor of the San Quentin News. He filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and contended that the guidelines of the Department of Corrections for the publication of inmate newspapers were constitutionally invalid on their face.

It could also exercise control over the content of the newspaper to serve valid penological objectives; however, censorship could not go beyond that which was necessary to achieve a legitimate penological objective. The court concluded that the regulations conformed to the standards set forth for a limited scope publication, which functions as a public forum, and that respondent could exercise control over the newspaper as set forth in the regulations on the grounds that the censorship provided for the reasonable security of the institution as well as reasonable protection of the public and served valid penological objectives.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant ex-husband and ex-wife separated and appellant contended the evidence was insufficient to justify the trial court's ruling that the home of the parties, held of record in joint tenancy, was actually the separate property of the wife. The court affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the house was the wife's separate property, subject to appellant's right to reimbursement for his separate fund contributions and his share of community fund payments on the mortgage installments. The court concluded that parties to a marriage could change the character of their marital property by expressions of mutual consent regardless of the title form shown on the deed of conveyance. The trial court was permitted to accept wife's testimony as proof of an oral understanding that property held of record in joint tenancy was actually the wife's separate property. The court concluded that the retroactive application of Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 4800.1, which extended the statute of frauds to spouses as to property acquired during marriage and held in joint tenancy form, would be an unconstitutional deprivation of a vested property right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff judges challenged an order by the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), which upheld the constitutionality of article 3.6 of the Judges' Retirement Law, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff judges sought review of a decision upholding the constitutionality of article 3.6 of the Judges' Retirement Law, Cal. Gov't. Code &sect;&sect; 75075-75079, which encouraged judges to retire at or before age 70 by providing reduced retirement benefits after age 70. The trial court concluded that the statute served the legitimate state purpose of maintaining the competency and work capacity of the judiciary. Plaintiffs contended that strict scrutiny of the statute was required because the disparate treatment of judges based on age affected the fundamental rights to pursue an occupation and to pursue an elective office. The court stated that the statute need only meet the rational basis test because there was no fundamental right to either continue in the judicial occupation or to run for an elective office. The court found that the correlation between increasing age and decreasing ability to competently perform work was a logical assumption and concluded that the age distinction embodied in the statute rested on a rational basis. The court ruled that the state had a legitimate interest in maintaining a vigorous and competent judiciary and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff judges had no fundamental right to either continue in the judicial profession or to seek and hold an elective office and the statute was rationally related to the legitimate state purpose of assuring the competency of the judiciary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Petitioner police officer became the focus of a criminal investigation. Respondent city's internal affairs department ordered petitioner to participate in an interview and was explicitly told that he had no civil rights and that he was not going to be read or admonished of his rights. Petitioner admitted involvement in crimes and was terminated immediately after the interview. The lower court denied petitioner's writ of mandate, which requested civil suppression of the interview statement and immediate reinstatement. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling on the reinstatement issue and held that petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and that the termination appeared to have been intended and accomplished without regard to the interview. The court reversed the lower court on all other grounds and held that Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 3303(g) granted petitioner a right to be silent in his interview and that the proper remedy was to exclude the improperly obtained statements from administrative consideration. The court found that excluding the improperly obtained information placed respondent in no worse position than if the right to silence was elected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed the lower court's order, which denied interim reinstatement to petitioner police officer, because petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant's prior juvenile adjudication for driving under the influence of alcohol was declared to be unconstitutional by the lower court because he was denied the right to appointed counsel in his hearing before a traffic hearing officer. The people challenged the ruling and asserted that by electing to proceed before a traffic hearing officer, defendant elected to have his misdemeanor procedurally treated as an infraction, for which there is no right to court-appointed counsel under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 19(c). On appeal the court affirmed the judgment and held that defendant was charged with a misdemeanor and that having the matter heard before a traffic hearing officer did not transform it into an infraction. The court held that misdemeanant defendants were entitled to the assistance of court-appointed counsel and that the waiver signed by defendant and one of his parents was deficient because it did not advise defendant that he had a right to counsel if his case was heard by a traffic hearing officer. The court found that defendant was not properly advised of, noror knowingly waived, his right to counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant father was mentally disabled and had custody of his minor child after the mother was hospitalized for psychiatric evaluation. After several visits to the home, respondent Department of Social Services sought to declare the child free from the custody of appellant. The trial court took extreme precautions to ensure that appellant had adequate representation, a personal appearance, an examination by a court appointed psychiatrist and allowed protracted delays before granting respondent's motion for summary judgment terminating appellant's parental rights. The court reversed the judgment and found that parental rights were of such constitutional importance that they should not have been flung aside on a motion for summary judgment. The court found that no matter how careful the trial court was in protecting appellant's rights, the constitutional gravity of a termination proceeding required that appellant be given a full trial on the issues.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court reversed the grant of summary judgment against appellant father in favor of respondent Department of Social Services because the summary judgment procedure was inappropriate to the statutorily required time periods which have been enacted with consideration for the needs of the parent, the child, and the public and appellant had a right to be heard at trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant, a wheel-chair bound drunk driver who had suffered severe permanent injury as a result of his own conduct, had been convicted for the third time of violation of Cal.

Penal Code &sect; 1385, that defendant's condition was &quot;punishment enough,&quot; that the court should disregard the statutory language that required a year in jail, and that jail authorities would have problems housing him. On petitioner prosecution's appeal, the court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing respondent court to vacate its sentence and hear evidence regarding jail conditions as they related to defendant's incarceration and resentence him. The court found that judicial sentencing had to comply with specific legislative directions unless cruel and unusual punishment resulted and that &sect; 1385 was not directly applicable. The court noted that there was no authority that self-inflicted injuries excused mandated incarceration, but noted that a defendant's condition could transform the confinement into cruel or unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the order of the trial court that terminated appellant's parental rights, and the case was remanded to the trial court to determine the issue of custody.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant injured minor's amended complaint alleged respondents assaulting minors was involved in joint activity in aiding and abetting the others in the perpetration of shooting marbles in a manner that exposed appellant to serious injury.

The court held that the harm in this case was clearly foreseeable. Further, there was a proximate connection between the verbal encouragement and the shooting. The court found that appellant's opposition to respondents' motion for summary judgment raised a triable issue of fact whether respondents actively encouraged, solicited or conspired to injure appellant, and that verbal encouragement was included within the parameters of Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant was convicted of vehicular manslaughter. The court reversed the conviction because the trial court's express findings established she was legally insane under the M'Naghten test at the time of the incident.

When it applied this test, the court determined that since the trial court held that appellant was incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong at the time of the incident, it expressly found the appellant met the second prong of the M'Naghten test and, therefore, appellant was entitled to a judgment of not guilty by reason of insanity.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court reversed and remanded the matter with directions to enter a judgment of not guilty by reason of insanity because the trial court's express findings established that appellant was legally insane under the M'Naghten test by finding she was incapable of distinguishing between right and wrong at the time of the incident.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant criminal appealed the decision of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which sentenced him to robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 213, with an enhancement of five years for a prior robbery conviction under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667. Defendant appealed that he was entitled to a more favorable provision in Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant criminal was sentenced for a robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 213 and an enhancement of five years for a prior robbery conviction, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667. The court affirmed the convictions and found that the rule of statutory construction by which a single penal statute was susceptible of two interpretations, the one more favorable to defendant should have been applied, was not applicable because defendant's offense was punishable by two separate statutes and, under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654, multiple convictions were not prohibited, only multiple punishments. The court found that the law did not require that defendant receive the benefit of the more favorable of two applicable statutes. The court found that defendant could not have been sentenced under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.5 because it only covered enhancements because of prior prison terms, not prior convictions, and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667 was the applicable statute. The court also found that under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(f), defendant's argument that his term exceeded twice his base term in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170.1(g) was meritless, because the article superseded the rule as it applied to enhancements.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed the judgment and sentence imposed by the trial court, and found that defendant criminal was not entitled to the California Penal Code section he had cited because it only covered enhancements related to prior prison terms, not prior convictions only, as in defendant's case. The court also found that although his sentence exceeded twice the base term, it was allowable for enhancements under the California State Constitution.</SPAN></P>

The state sought a writ of mandate, which was granted by the court and directed respondent to sustain the state's demurrer and previous motions. The Tort Claims Act barred the action because the amended complaint alleged a factual basis for recovery that was not fairly reflected in the claim filed with the state. The claim did not give any indication that the mudslide caused personal or mental injuries or resulted in damages for such injuries. The order of sanctions was vacated because the state's motion for partial summary judgment was not a motion for reconsideration of its demurrer and Cal. Civ. Proc.

The appellate court rejected plaintiff's argument, holding that plaintiff failed to meet its burden of proving that its acquisitions of master tapes were within the same class as the acquisition of movies by movie studios. The court noted that plaintiff acquired original master tapes from independent producers by purchase, whereas the exemption for movies was based on lease transactions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant was charged with grand theft, a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 487(1). There was substantial evidence that he stole a television from his sister. The information further alleged that he had suffered two prior felony convictions. During trial, defense counsel stated that defendant wanted to admit the priors. After a full advisement, defendant announced that he did not wish to admit the priors and his attorney requested the court try the matter after the jury had returned its verdict on the underlying charge. Defendant did not personally waive his right to trial by jury. After the verdict was returned and the jury excused, defendant was again advised of the requirement regarding his prior convictions and he stated that he wanted the issue tried by the same jury that tried the underlying offense. The trial court impaneled another jury that found defendant had suffered the two prior convictions. Defendant argued the procedure regarding the prior convictions was improper and double jeopardy invalidated the verdict. The appellate court affirmed the order because the procedure regarding the prior convictions did not unconstitutionally burden defendant's right to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The appellate court affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting defendant of grand theft and finding defendant had suffered the two prior convictions because there was no evidence of the kind of governmental oppression that might compel invocation of the double jeopardy clause and the defense counsel properly consented to having a different jury try the issue of defendant's prior convictions then the substantive offense jury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">During an audit, it was discovered that respondent counties had been underpaid for the state's share of expenditures under the Short-Doyle Act, Cal.

The State Board of Control partially disapproved the claims, and the legislature deleted the claims from the special appropriations bills submitted to it. Respondents then sought a writ of mandate from the trial court to direct that the claims be paid. The trial court granted the petition.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellants, operator of group homes and associated individuals and entities, sought review of decisions of the Superior Court of Madera County (California), which denied appellants' application for a peremptory writ of administrative mandamus against respondents, Madera County, Madera County Planning Commission, and Madera County Board of Supervisors, in one case; and which sustained respondents' demurrer without leave to amend in second action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant group home and associated individuals applied to respondent Madera County Planning Commission for conditional use permits to enable them to increase occupancy of their homes for children. After the permits were denied after an appeal to respondent Madera County Board of Supervisors, appellants submitted a claim for damages on behalf of two minors for violation of the right to privacy under Cal. Const.; respondent board of supervisors denied the claim. Appellants next filed a petition for administrative mandamus seeking review of the decision of the board of supervisors on behalf of two children on grounds of denial of a fair hearing and abuse of discretion. A second action sought damages and other relief, and the trial court sustained a demurrer based on immunity. On appeal, the court held that the trial court erred in applying the substantial-evidence test in reviewing the evidence, because the proper test was the independent-judgment test given that a fundamental vested right was involved. The court thus reversed and remanded that cause. The court also ruled that Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 818.4 immunized respondents in the action for damages, and thus affirmed the demurrer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court reversed the decision of the superior court as to application of the substantial-evidence test in the mandamus action, ordering that, upon remand, the trial court apply the independent-judgment test in light of the fundamental vested right involved. The court affirmed the trial court's sustaining the demurrer in the second action, because respondent county and county officials were statutorily immunized as to the claims advanced.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded. The court ruled that preemption was compelled whether explicitly stated in the federal statute's language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose. The court found no explicit intent in PMPA to preempt the field but held that state law was nullified to the extent that it actually conflicted with federal law. The court found that &sect; 20999.1 and PMPA were both enacted to protect franchisees, but that PMPA was intended to protect the interests of franchisers also. Because &sect; 20999.1(d) restricted franchisor changes differently, it was not the same as PMPA, and the court ruled that, to that extent, it was an obstacle to congressional purposes and objectives and was preempted by PMPA. Therefore, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief.</SPAN></P>

The case was remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Respondent was convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of former Cal. Veh.

At the time of his offense, &sect; 23102 prohibited driving under the influence, and specified the punishment for a first conviction of the offense, fine or imprisonment in county jail or both. The version of &sect; 13352 then in effect provided that DMV was required to suspend a first offender's license only if the court so ordered, whereas at the time of his conviction, DMV was required to suspend a first offender's license unless the court granted probation. DMV argued that the actual effect of amended &sect; 13352 was prospective rather than retroactive, and therefore, its operation was valid. Affirming the lower court decision, the court held that amended &sect; 13352(a)(1), should not have applied to respondent, who was convicted under former &sect; 23102(a) because the amended provision could not be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187. The court found that &sect;190.2 was constitutional because the law of California provided corrective mechanisms for individualizing, when appropriate, a potential punishment of life imprisonment without possibility of parole. The court further stated that the trial court had jurisdiction to impose a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole in a noncapital case. The court found that appellant was statutorily eligible for the death penalty. The court reasoned that if the trial court could not impose a life sentence in noncapital cases, a prosecutor who wanted only a sentence of life without possibility of parole would have to expose the defendant to the possibility of death in order to achieve the lesser sentence. Last, the court held appellant was entitled to a hearing to permit the trial court to consider whether to exercise its discretion under &sect; 1385 to dismiss special circumstance findings in order to make it possible for appellant to be eligible for parole and remanded that portion of the judgment. Otherwise, the judgment appealed from was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant women's center appealed a judgment that granted respondent district attorney and respondent Catholic league summary adjudication of issues in appellant's suit that sought to enjoin respondent attorney's release of fetuses for a private, non-secular burial ceremony. The fetuses were recovered from a doctor who had not complied with state law regarding the proper disposal of fetal tissue. The court reversed the judgment. The court agreed with appellant's claims that the proposed release of the fetuses violated the establishment and free exercise clauses of the state constitution. Cal. Const. amend. art. I, &sect; 4 and art. XVI, &sect; 5. The court ruled that, under strict scrutiny analysis, the proposed release showed an unconstitutional bias and partiality towards respondent attorney's religious beliefs. The court ruled that the proposed release: (1) lacked a clear, secular purpose; (2) would have impermissibly demonstrated governmental support for respondent's religious beliefs, and; (3) created excessive political entanglement with religion.</SPAN></P>

Gov't Code &sect; 51200 et seq., and approving a land development project because the development was rural and did not leapfrog growth from other population centers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Petitioners contended the trial court was wrong in approving a controversial land development project. Petitioners asserted that respondent Board of Supervisors of San Diego County wrongly cancelled a 10-year contract signed by prior landowners. The land was designed as agricultural preserve under the Williamson Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 51200 et seq. The company, real party in interest, contended that the land was rural and thus would not violate legal restrictions against urban sprawl. Respondent decided that the Williamson Act contract could be canceled for the project because the development was rural. In approving the project, respondent found that its development was not big enough to be considered urban, and therefore did not constitute leapfrog growth. The court reversed and remanded. The court held that respondent ran afoul of laws detailing when land may be removed from agricultural preserve status and approved for development. Respondent had to reconsider the project and the issue of contiguity. In deciding not to consider a new law that would allow the project, the court said, the legislature had no right to pass the bill because it tried to interpret a previous law.</SPAN></P>

The court was satisfied the record presently contained little, if any, evidence to suggest respondent could have factually supported a finding that the project met the statutory requirement of contiguity.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected this contention, finding that appellants were not exempt from obtaining licenses because appellants did not provide care and treatment in the form of prayer or spiritual means as defined under &sect; 1505(g). The court held that respondent was entitled to an injunction as a matter of right because appellants were not exempt and were operating without licenses in violation of Cal.

Section 1167 was neither a due process nor an equal protection constitutional violation. The detainer statutes were created to expeditiously allow for the orderly eviction of tenants and protect the landlord's property. Tenants had other forms of defenses which could be raised, and the state-provided answer form contained these defenses in non-technical language.

The trial court entered an order preliminarily enjoining appellant from applying and enforcing its ordinance. On appeal, the court concluded that the delay inherent in the rent adjustment procedures of the ordinance was not substantially greater than was practically necessary and, thus, was reasonable and constitutionally permissible. Further, the court concluded that the ordinance's automatic or permissive adjustment formula permitting the rent to be increased by a certain percentage in order to guarantee park owners a fair Net Operating Standard (NOI) was facially constitutional. The ordinance permitted park owners to adjust for inflation to maintain the same NOI they enjoyed in the rental market before rent control.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The trial court determined that Cal. Educ.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant was convicted of robbery and sentenced to the mid term of three years for robbery and a five-year enhancement for a prior conviction of manslaughter, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667. Defendant appealed, challenging &sect; 667 on three theories: (1) the enhancement provision constituted an ex post facto law; (2) the provisions constituted cruel and unusual punishment; and (3) the trial court abused its discretion in failing to strike the enhancement pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1385. The court affirmed. Because defendant committed the robbery well after the enactment of &sect; 667, no ex post facto proscription arose from the enactment of that statute. Furthermore, because &sect; 667 applied only to certain serious felonies, the court saw no basis to declare the statute cruel or unusual punishment per se. Finally, the court held that there was no abuse of discretion because &sect; 667 was not sufficiently specific to divest the trial court of its discretion to strike a prior conviction which was alleged for purposes of sentence enhancement. Moreover, under &sect; 1385, the interests of justice would not be served by unnecessary appellate review.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the continuing penalty of sex offender registration was out of proportion to the crime of misdemeanor indecent exposure, and that registration pursuant to &sect; 290 cannot constitutionally be imposed as punishment for persons convicted of misdemeanors under &sect; 314.1, therefore the judgment was modified to eliminate the registration requirement.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the judgment of conviction because written parental permission excused a minor from the sanctions imposed by &sect; 12021.5 and would have to be raised by defense counsel, and there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction because there was circumstantial evidence linking him to the gun. The appellate court stated that the existence of written parental permission did not define or describe the offense. The offense was the possession of a concealable firearm by a minor. Subjecting defendant to the burden of producing exonerating evidence would not have been unduly harsh or unfair. The appellate court also stated that there was ample evidence, albeit circumstantial evidence, to support defendant's conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Following his conviction on charges related to his management and ownership of a theater specializing in sexually explicit live entertainment, appellant contended that his convictions could not stand because the on-stage performances at the theater were protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, the evidence was insufficient to support the pimping and pandering convictions, and the evidence of appellant's management and operation of the theater was derived from unlawfully seized evidence. The court acknowledged that the state's unquestioned authority to prosecute under the pimping and pandering laws presented an incidental restriction on appellant's First Amendment freedoms. However, that restriction was no greater than was essential to further the substantial government interest in controlling prostitution. The court found that the pimping and pandering laws did not prohibit live, nude entertainment, but merely directed that the entertainers could not have sexual relations with the audience. The court concluded that the application of the statutes in question to the on-stage performances at the theater did not unconstitutionally infringe upon freedom of speech or expression.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Respondent court held appellant owners and appellant manager in contempt for violating a preliminary injunction against allowing lewdness, obscenity, and prostitution at their theater pursuant to the Red Light Abatement Law, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 11225 et seq. The court reversed as to appellant manager, because he was named neither as a defendant in the complaint, nor in the order to show cause re contempt, nor in the affidavits in support of the order to show cause. The court found that due to arithmetic error appellant owners could be punished for, at most, 56 separate acts of contempt. The court concluded that the contempt in the case was criminal, because the sanctions were plainly punitive. The court found that the concurrent six-month jail terms, considered alone, met the test for petty contempt; therefore, appellants were not entitled to a jury trial on that issue alone. The court concluded that fines of $ 1,000 for each act of contempt to be assessed against appellants should be deemed petty for purposes of jury-trial analysis.

V rights were violated because admissions made to a psychotherapist were admitted and testimony of victim's mother were hearsay.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant sexually molested his stepdaughter on two occasions. Several days later, appellant sought help from a neuropsychiatric institute. He was assigned to speak with a licensed clinical social worker and full time employee at the emergency walk-in psychiatric unit for evaluation. The clinical worker suspected appellant had sexually molested his stepdaughter and, under legal duty pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 11166, relayed the information given him by appellant to the UCLA child abuse center and contacted the campus police, who in turn notified the police department. Appellant was arrested and made a motion to suppress the admissions made to the clinical worker, and the testimony of both the victim and her mother. The trial court denied the motions and held the clinical worker's testimony was admissible although he did not testify. The court affirmed, holding that statements made to the clinical worker were voluntary and the patient-client privilege did not apply; the testimony would have been admissible had he testified. Prosecutor could introduce evidence to prevent the assumption that the offense did not occur because no complaint was made.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Respondent Agricultural Labor Relations Board found that petitioner agricultural employer engaged in unfair labor practices under Cal.

Respondent ordered petitioner to make the real parties whole for their losses plus interest. Petitioner sought review of the ruling. The court affirmed and noted that the case would be remanded for respondent to conduct back pay proceedings. The court held that respondent was not a court under Cal. Const. art., VI, &sect; 1 and an award by respondent was not a court judgment. Respondent's remedies were designed to effectuate public policy and not merely to compensate for private loses. Therefore, the interest rate of ten percent under Cal. Const. art., XV, &sect; 1 was inapplicable to an award under the Act. However, any court order obtained for back pay must bear interest at the rate of ten percent as provided by art. XV, &sect; 1 and Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 685.010(a), because it then became a court judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant unemployment insurance appeals board affirmed the decision of the administrative law judge, which found respondent claimant ineligible to receive benefits for a particular week because he was unavailable to work two days in order to observe Jewish holidays. Respondent filed a petition for peremptory writ of mandate. The trial court granted the writ and ordered payment of benefits for the week at issue, minus two-sevenths of the amount of said benefits to represent the days he was unavailable. Appellant challenged. The court held that there was no valid constitutional distinction between a permanent disqualification and a temporary interruption of unemployment benefits. Under appellant's interpretation of Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code &sect; 1253(c), respondent was required to surrender his constitutional right of free exercise of religion in order to receive state benefits to which he would otherwise have been entitled. Under these circumstances, the trial court's interpretation of &sect; 1253(c) to permit apportionment of benefits on a daily, rather than a weekly, basis was constitutionally compelled.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of Orange County (California), in which he was convicted of two counts of incest under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 285, one count of sodomy under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 286(b)(1), and one count of oral copulation under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant revealed to a counselor that he had been having intercourse with his deaf-mute daughter for eight years.

Penal Code &sect; 285, sodomy under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 286(b)(1), and oral copulation under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288(a)(b)(1), and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Defendant challenged his conviction, and the court affirmed. The court denied defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the Child Abuse Reporting Act because the right to seek a cure for an illness was not a fundamental right and the state's interest in protecting children was more than justified. The disclosure requirement of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 11166 did not violate defendants rights under U.S. Const. amend. V because the psychologist was not a &quot;state agent&quot; and defendant waived his rights when he revealed incriminating information after being told of the reporting requirement. Defendant failed to show prejudice due to his failure to receive a complete record of his daughter's testimony because he was fluent in sign language.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the Child Abuse Reporting Act did not violate defendant's right to due process because defendant failed to show a fundamental right and the state had a strong interest in protecting children. Defendant's fifth amendment rights were not violated because the counselor was not a state agent.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, appellant's method of calculating the property factor was reasonable because it was authorized by &sect; 25137(d). Likewise, appellant's calculation of the sales factor was reasonable because it applied the concept of sales in the state, which was provided in Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 25134.

The trial court denied petitioner's motion. Petitioner sought a writ of mandate to vacate the order denying his motion. The court denied the writ and concluded that the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act, which was codified in Cal. Civ. Proc.

Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect;&sect; 19405 and 19406, and one count of theft, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 487(1). Defendant contended that it was improper to use a presumption that official duty had been regularly performed, as it imposed an improper burden of proof.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant appealed his conviction for tax fraud and theft. He disagreed with the court's finding of no discriminatory prosecution and contended the wrong burden of proof was imposed. It was presumed that official duty had been regularly performed. This rebuttable presumption affected the burden of proof, and imposed upon the party against whom it operated the burden of proof as to the nonexistence of the presumed fact. This presumption was employed in assessing the defense of discriminatory prosecution, and imposed the burden of proof on defendant. While the burden imposed was not clearly identified, the indications were that it was erroneously high, but harmless. Defendant also challenged the characterization of his theft conviction as embezzlement. While the transaction could not have been embezzlement, sufficient evidence supported a conviction of theft by false pretenses. However, the prosecution presented its case on alternate theories, some of which were legally incorrect, and the reviewing court could not determine on which theory the ensuing general verdict of guilt rested, so the conviction could not stand. The court also addressed state tax crimes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The convictions of tax fraud were affirmed, but as misdemeanor violations of the state's Revenue and Taxation Code. The cause was remanded for resentencing, unless within 30 days of issuance of the remittitur the state filed a written demand for a new trial. If such demand is filed, a new trial should take place. As to the count of theft, the prosecutor relied on an embezzlement theory which could not have been sustained as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Respondent motor vehicles department claimed that appellant bus service used buses for nonexempt transportation without paying the requisite registration fees. After unsuccessfully attempting to obtain appellant's business records through an administrative subpoena, respondent sought a search warrant under an affidavit which alleged that the records would establish a violation of Cal.

The trial court considered illegally seized evidence when it reviewed appellant's records, which fell under the exclusionary rule on an invalid search warrant, and absent that evidence, decision lacked substantial evidence. Appellant's conduct did not fit the crime of theft under Cal. Penal Code &sect;484.

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its rulings. The court determined that the finding that a liveaboard ordinance was unconstitutional was not a collateral estoppel on the constitutionality of the rent law because the two laws differed significantly. A stringent examination under the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, 10, cl. 1, found that there was no unconstitutional impairment of the contract by the rent law because the control was a reasonable exercise of police power, necessary, and properly tailored to its legislative purpose of safeguarding tenants during a time of low vacancies and high rents. The rent law comported with constitutional due process, did not deprive appellants of equal protection of the laws, and did not breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">In 1979 Cal.

The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate requested by petitioners teachers association, individual public school teachers, teachers' retirement board, and individual board members and directed respondent to transfer the full statutory amount without the budgetary limitations. The court held that Cal. Educ. Code &sect;&sect; 23401 et seq. implied an intent to grant private rights of contract with the state's teachers and that when the promise to permanently fund the pension was accepted by the teachers by initial or continued employment, a contract was formed. The court found that the legislature had not retained power to modify the payment amounts and the underfunding was an impermissible impairment of a contractual funding obligation under both U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Petitioner criminal was charged with felony grand theft and prostitution, a misdemeanor. Subsequently, the grand theft offense was reduced to a misdemeanor. Thereafter, petitioner applied for an order of diversion, and the application was denied on the sole ground that, since the grand theft charge had been filed as a felony in the first instance, it could have been charged as a misdemeanor and she was ineligible for diversion. Petitioner contended that the local guidelines which deprived her of the benefits of the diversion statute denied her equal protection of laws under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. The court granted the application, holding that to the extent that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1001.2(b) purported to confer upon the local district attorney the right to control criteria for diversion, it was violative of Cal. Const. art. III, &sect; 3. In so concluding, the court acknowledged that the Legislature had power to establish criteria governing diversion provided equal protection guarantees were scrupulously observed. Once having done so, however, it could not vest in the judiciary powers which are subject to prosecutorial control.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant city challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Santa Clara County (California), that ruled that a city ordinance violated appellee landlords' due process rights under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant city adopted the San Jose Cal., Ordinance No. 19696, &sect;&sect; 5703.28(c)(7), 5703.29, 5704.1, and 5704.2, titled San Jose Rental Dispute Mediation and Arbitration Ordinance (ordinance) to impose limits upon the rents paid by tenants, and which also imposed a rental unit fee to pay for the costs of administering the ordinance. The court affirmed the judgment that found that &sect;&sect; 5703.28(c)(7) and 5703.29 of the ordinance violated appellee landlords' due process rights under U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV, but that the rental unit fee, under &sect;&sect; 5704.1 and 5704.2, was not a special tax and did not circumvent Cal. Const. art. XIIIA, &sect; 4. The ordinance exhibited a constitutional infirmity upon its face, because it was totally arbitrary and unjustifiable to base rent upon a tenant's financial condition and ran counter to the purpose of rent control regulation. It also amounted to a forced subsidy on the part of the appellees. However, the rental unit fee imposed by the ordinance to pay for the cost of administering the hearing process for rent determinations was not a special tax and did not require a vote.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that attempted voluntary manslaughter, as punishable at the time sentence was imposed, was excepted from the application of the enhancement statute,&nbsp;Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.7, insofar as the punishment imposed for attempted voluntary manslaughter would be greater than the punishment imposed for voluntary manslaughter under similar circumstances.

Rent control was a valid exercise of the police power, and it affected the vested rights of every landlord who owned property before the rent control measure took effect.

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11351. Defendants proffered a jury instruction, which stated that Cal. Health, &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11055(b)(4) banned only &quot;l-cocaine&quot; and not &quot;d-cocaine.&quot; Defendant's also tendered testimony that &quot;d-cocaine&quot; was not chemically equivalent to &quot;l-cocaine&quot; and that the prosecution's tests did not discriminate between &quot;l-cocaine&quot; and &quot;d-cocaine.

Under &sect; 11055(b)(4), only &quot;l-cocaine,&quot; not &quot;d-cocaine,&quot; was a controlled substance, and that the failure to so instruct the jury unconstitutionally relieved the state of the burden of proving that the substance possessed by defendants was controlled &quot;l-cocaine.&quot; Alternatively, the errors fatally compromised the jury verdict by depriving the jury of the definitional standard by which to determine whether the substance was &quot;l-cocaine.&quot;</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant state employee worked as a youth counselor and took sick leave for his obsessive-compulsive disorder. Appellant did not leave a correct address or telephone number where he could be reached and failed to document when he might be released to return to work. Several months later, after appellant was located in another part of the state, working at a new job, he was discharged. Respondent California State Personnel Board affirmed the action. Appellant unsuccessfully sought a petition for a writ of mandate to set aside respondent's decision and then sought further review. The court affirmed, finding that the automatic resignation provision contained in Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 19503 applied because the evidence established that appellant had abandoned his job and had been given proper notice of his termination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed the denial of appellant state employee's petition for a writ of mandate to set aside the decision of respondent California State Personnel Board.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant auto dealer sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), entered on jury verdicts, in which appellant was convicted of making sales of securities which violated the Corporate Securities Law of 1968, Cal. Corp. Code &sect;&sect; 25110 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant dealer solicited money from investors to fund used car purchases. Appellant repaired and resold the cars, sharing his profit with his investor. While each investor had his own arrangement, each signed a contract, &quot;owned&quot; specific cars, and made money only when &quot;his&quot; cars were sold. A jury convicted appellant of selling securities in violation of Cal. Corp. Code &sect; 25110. Appellant appealed, arguing that what he sold was not a &quot;security,&quot; as statutorily defined, and that the jury was wrongly instructed. The court agreed, and reversed. The court found that while the lower court correctly instructed the jury that appellant had the burden of proving entitlement to any exemption from regulation, the lower court erred in describing all joint ventures as so &quot;exempt.&quot; The error was exacerbated when, over appellant's objection, the state argued that appellant had to prove a joint venture exemption, and by the lower court's failure to instruct the jury on the defense burden of proof. Finding that the net effect of the errors was to lessen the state's burden of proving the &quot;security&quot; element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt, the court reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court reversed appellant auto dealer's conviction, by a jury, of selling securities in violation of state law, finding that the lower court erred when it instructed the jury that interests sold by appellant were exempt, rather than having the jury determine whether the interests were securities, and subject to regulation. Because the error could have resulted in a lessening the state's burden of proof, the error was prejudicial.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that because the purpose of those statutes was to encourage private citizens to enforce their civil rights, and because the public at large benefitted from the vindication of such rights, the award of attorney fees in plaintiff's case was warranted. Moreover, the court specifically ruled that for purposes of &sect; 1988 and other similar federal statutes, defendants' good faith belief that they were required to enforce the underlying statutes was not a &quot;special circumstance&quot; that rendered the award of attorney fees inappropriate.</SPAN></P>

On petitioner's application for a writ of habeas corpus, the court stayed the contempt order and held that petitioner should not be penalized with a contempt citation for a good faith assertion of her client's self-incrimination privilege absent a determination that disclosure of the information sought could not possibly have a tendency to incriminate. The court rejected the additional arguments that the disclosure would deny the client effective assistance of counsel, where the attorney-client privilege did not attach to statements given to a defense investigator acting as an agent of the attorney, or that the document was protected from disclosure as work product.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 1500 et seq. The court affirmed the judgment. The court rejected plaintiffs' contention that the Act violated equal protection and due process. The court ruled that the classification of such facilities as &quot;residences,&quot; which thereby negated the &quot;business&quot; features of such facilities, bore a rational relationship to the legitimate state interest of moving persons out of institutions and into &quot;normal&quot; family-like surroundings. Moreover, the court ruled, for due process purposes, notice and an opportunity to be heard, as required by zoning and land-use statutes, were not applicable under the Act because the use of the land was not substantially altered. The court also rejected plaintiffs' claim that &quot;residence only&quot; restrictive covenants in the parties' deeds precluded defendants' facility.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellants, Mexican-American citizens and voters, sought review of an adverse judgment in an action challenging the constitutional validity of electing members of the district's school board by an at-large system.

The court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to negate appellants' claim of discriminatory effects resulting from alleged ethnic bloc voting and to support a finding that racial polarization did not exist in any appreciable degree. The court found that appellee was responsive to the needs and interests of the Hispanic population within its ambit of governance. The court stated that there was substantial evidence to support the trial court's determination that the system did not operate to achieve a dilution of Hispanic voting power in derogation of the equal protection clause of the California Constitution.

The court held that respondent's regulations on training and hours of operation were rationally related to the goals of ensuring the health of patrons and discouraging prostitution.

They also asserted that plaintiff lacked standing and failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court dismissing the claim.

Defendant contended that at the hearing, his right to cross examine the police officers who conducted the field sobriety tests was unconstitutionally limited by the hearing examiner, who stated that he would not allow detailed cross-examination about the field tests. The court affirmed the trial court's decision, finding that the decision was thorough and showed sufficient evidence to find that defendant was not prejudiced by the erroneous limitation because he was allowed full cross examination of the officers. The court stated it would overlook technical oversights and rejected defendant's argument that a temporary legislative misnumbering of the drunk driving laws made his arrest illegal. The court chastised respondent for conducting hearings wherein the complaint of a citizen challenging the suspension of his license was heard by one of respondent's own employees, because such hearing, at best, gave a tarnished perspective of justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant challenged the judgment from the Superior Court of Kern County (California) convicting him of felony murder with special circumstances and attempted robbery, and sentencing him to life imprisonment without parole. The court had previously reversed appellant's conviction for a lack of a Miranda warning, but the United States Supreme Court had reversed the court's decision and remanded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant was convicted of felony murder with special circumstances and attempted robbery after appellant's companion shot and killed a woman during an attempted robbery. Appellant was drunk at the time of the robbery. The court reversed appellant's conviction, but the United States Supreme Court reversed the court. On remand, the court struck the special circumstances finding and reduced appellant's conviction to voluntary manslaughter. There was absolutely no evidence that appellant harbored an intent to kill; the evidence showed he was drunk to the point of stupor. Appellant did not participate in the killing, could not prevent the shooting, and called the police and assisted in their investigation. Appellant's punishment was grossly excessive compared to that of his companion, who had been convicted of voluntary manslaughter. The court held the sentence for either first or second degree murder would violate the prohibition of Cal. Const., art. I, &sect; 17, against cruel or unusual punishment. Therefore, the court reduced appellant's conviction to voluntary manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff petitioned for redetermination of tax, and later for a refund of the taxes paid. The trial court opined that due process required that the meaning of statutes be definite and certain and granted plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The court reversed the decision of the trial court on the ground that the applicable statutes and regulations, Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 6006 (b), Cal. Admin.

Penal Code &sect; 2932 violates the ex post facto clauses of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, because the statute was passed after he was convicted. The lower court denied petitioner's writ for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. After appeal to the state Supreme Court, the matter was remanded for determination of the constitutionality of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2932. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 2932 violated neither the state nor federal constitutions because the new statute only applied prospectively, not retroactively, to petitioner's actions taken after his conviction. Therefore, petitioner had prior notice of prohibited conduct that would result in the forfeiture of good time credit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed its prior ruling because the penal statute that caused petitioner prisoner to lose good credit applied only to violations in prison occurring after the statute had been passed and therefore the statute was not an unconstitutional ex-post facto law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant asserted that a mental defect precluded him from having the specific intent, malice aforethought, and premeditation necessary to sustain his conviction for attempted murder. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The trial court limited the testimony of appellant's psychiatrists pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 28-29. The court held that &sect;&sect; 28-29 did not impose an unconstitutional limit on defendant's due process right to present a defense. The court held that &sect; 28, which precluded defendant from introducing evidence that he lacked the capacity to formulate malice aforethought and to premeditate, reflected the legislature's determination that for reasons of reliability or public policy, capacity evidence was inadmissible. The court held that &sect; 29, which prohibited experts from testifying that defendant did not have the required mental status, merely placed the determination of whether defendant had the required mental status in the exclusive province of the trier of fact. The court reversed the conviction for attempted murder in the first degree because there was no instruction relating premeditation to defendant's mental state defense.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance provided that an existing apartment unit could not be converted into a condominium without a special-use permit and that an apartment building, which was a nonconforming use because of parking, was not entitled to conversion. Appellant challenged the decision, claiming that a change in form of ownership of the property was not a change in &quot;use,&quot; that the ordinance exceeded respondent's police power under Cal. Const. art. XI, &sect; 7, and that the ordinance violated the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court agreed and concluded the ordinance was invalid under the state and federal constitutions. The court reversed the decision and remanded to the trial court for issuance of a writ of mandate requiring respondent to grant the permit. The court held that respondent's denial of the permit exceeded its police powers because the ordinance as applied to appellant was unreasonable, oppressive and not substantially related to the public health, safety or welfare.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant appealed a jury verdict from the trial court, which convicted him of four counts of forcible oral copulation in violation of Cal.

The court affirmed, and the California Supreme Court remanded to the court for reconsideration in light of a recently decided opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant was convicted of four counts of forcible oral copulation in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288(a)(c) and four counts of rape by means of threat in violation of former Cal. Penal Code &sect; 261(3), now Cal. Penal Code &sect; 261(2). Upon remand from the Supreme Court, the court affirmed the judgment, but remanded for resentencing because it agreed with defendant that the proper statute to be applied in this case was Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.6(c) instead of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667.6(d). The court rejected the state's argument that the offenses against the last victim, who was raped more than one time, were committed on separate occasions because the termination of the first rape through sexual climax was when the first occasion ended and another began. The court held that the crimes against the last victim occurred on a single evening in one continuous, uninterrupted sequence over a short period of time in a car parked at the same spot. Therefore, the &quot;same victim on separate occasions&quot; clause of &sect; 667.6(d) could not be invoked to require the defendant serve full, separate, and consecutive sentences for each of the offenses committed against the last victim.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed the conviction, but remanded for resentencing. The court held that just because the victim had been raped more than one time by defendant, the &quot;same victim on separate occasions&quot; requirement was not met that would allow full, separate, and consecutive sentences for each of the offenses committed in one continuous, uninterrupted sequence over a short period of time.</SPAN></P>

Appellant claimed that his sentence was cruel and unusual because the statutory scheme of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 1732.5 and Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant robbed a restaurant at gunpoint a few days after his 18th birthday. Appellant pleaded guilty to robbery under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 211 and firearm use under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.5. Appellant was not eligible for a California Youth Authority (CYA) commitment under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 1732.5 because he was over 18 or probation under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.0 because a firearm was used. Appellant claimed that the statutory scheme resulted in a mandatory prison term and subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 17. The court affirmed and held that even though appellant's gun was unloaded, the victim could have responded with great bodily force, thus, his offense was a potentially violent crime. Further, the court held that appellant's argument was not that the length of sentence was disproportionate, but that the place of confinement, prison, rather than CYA or probation, was cruel or unusual. Imprisonment for armed robbery was recognized as an acceptable means of punishment for armed robbery and was not so disproportionate to the crime that it shocked the conscience and offended fundamental notions of human dignity.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed the judgment that sentenced appellant to three years in a state prison for armed robbery because imprisonment was a recognized, acceptable means of punishment for the very serious crime of armed robbery, and the automatic denial of probation or commitment to California Youth Authority did not constitute cruel or unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff corporation sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which refused to refund ad valorem taxes paid by plaintiff to defendants, county and cities. Plaintiff maintained that said taxes were prohibited pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 225.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff corporation sought a refund of ad valorem taxes imposed by defendant county and cities. Plaintiff's refund claim was based on Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 225, which exempted from taxation property manufactured outside of the United States and brought into the state for trans-shipment out of the state. The court first determined that defendants had standing to raise the issue of the constitutionality of &sect; 225 because defendants stood to suffer economic injury in the form of lost tax revenues. The court then found that &sect; 225 was not unconstitutional. The statute promoted uniformity in commercial relations with foreign nations. In analyzing a potential conflict with the commerce clause, the court found &sect; 225 was tied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the state and did not discriminate against interstate commerce. The court held that plaintiff was entitled to the relief sought and the trial court's judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The judgment of the lower court, permitting the levying of ad valorem tax on appellant corporation was reversed. Statute providing exemption from the tax was consistent with the federal import-export clause and nonviolative of the federal commerce clause.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant parents sought review of an order, which denied their request to have respondent mentally incompetent adult sterilized. On appeal the court affirmed the order because the jurisdiction of the probate court was statutory and no statute authorized the probate court to order sterilization on an incompetent person. The court found that Cal. Probate Code &sect; 2356 was not pertinent to the case, because it was not in effect at the time of appellant's petition. The court reviewed the constitutionality of &sect; 2356 because appellants challenged its constitutionality. The court held that Cal. Probate Code &sect; 2356 was constitutional because it protected a person in respondent's situation from being sterilized against her will. The court held that respondent was not being denied her equal protection rights under the constitution because competent and incompetent persons differed significantly in their ability to give informed consent and as a result classification based on that difference was reasonable and the state had a duty to take reasonable steps to protect an incompetent person's rights to privacy, which included the right to bear or not bear children.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendants, state and state controller, appeal the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), that granted plaintiff former employees' motion for summary judgment of their action to recover a lump sum payment as retroactive salary adjustments for a time period when they were employees of defendant state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Plaintiff former employees of defendant state sought damages when they were excluded from the lump sum payment to certain classes of state employees, including current employees on or after May 31, 1979, and those who retired between October 1, 1978, and May 31, 1979. The payments were expressly to provide compensation equivalent to a seven-percent increase if same had been awarded on October 1, 1978. Defendants, state and state controller, and plaintiffs filed cross motions for summary judgment, and plaintiffs' motion was granted. The court affirmed the award of summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs, holding that plaintiffs' exclusion from the lump sum payments violated the Civil Service Act which required that like salaries be paid for comparable duties and responsibilities. Because plaintiffs performed the same jobs during the subject time period as those employees who remained in employment, to exclude them from the admitted salary adjustment bonuses impermissibly created two pay scales for workers doing the same job. Further, the utilization of a cutoff date to withhold compensation for the same services from one group of employees was arbitrary and unjustified.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The judgment granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiff former employees was affirmed because the court determined that denying the payments to plaintiffs, who were employees of the same time period as those who did not leave before the cutoff date, violated the Civil Service Act and was an unconstitutional impairment of a vested contractual right.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, affirmed the trial court jury instruction, and held that it would have been error for the trial court to apply the specific intent instruction because felony child endangerment was a general intent crime. Further, defendant challenged the probation condition that she not conceive during the probationary period as an unconstitutional restriction of her fundamental rights to privacy and to procreate. The court concluded that the condition in question was reasonable but overbroad.

The trial court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment and sustained their demurrer. The court affirmed and held that no election on annexation was required under Cal.

The court held that appellants had no fundamental right to a vote on the annexation because the legislature had no duty to provide a right to such a vote, and that its policy was based on the legitimate interest of promoting an orderly, efficient, and economical formation and determination of city boundaries. The court held that no municipal reorganization was at issue under &sect; 35300, and that an election on the annexation was contrary to the legislature's purpose. Appellants' property, which had been previously annexed, was not exempt from a later, partial annexation under &sect;&sect; 35014 and 35150(f), and that appellants' property was only part of the island.

Defendant admitted to having used a weapon to commit the robbery and to having been previously convicted of robbery. Defendant appealed his sentence contending that &sect; 667 was unconstitutional because it constituted cruel and unusual punishment and violated due process of law. The court affirmed the ruling because it found that the statute had a reasonable and proper purpose in discouraging persons who committed serious felonies from doing it again. Defendant committed armed robbery and then again committed robbery with the use of a deadly weapon. These crimes were dangerous to society.

The court affirmed, holding the fact that subsequent decisions established that a felony-murder special circumstance allegation required an intent to kill or aid in a killing, and that a minor could not be sentenced to life without possibility of parole did not affect appellant's voluntary guilty plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant corporation petitioned for a writ of mandate after respondent county rejected appellant's proposed use of its real property to build a convenience store. The lower court denied the writ, and appellant sought review. The court, on appeal, affirmed the judgment of the lower court. The court acknowledged that the site in question was in a zone where a convenience store could have been lawfully maintained. However, this did not diminish respondent's power to determine that a particular development was not suitable for that location. The court also held that respondent did not improperly delegate legislative power because respondent was following the mandate of Alameda County, Cal., Ordinance Code &sect; 8-95-5, which allowed respondent to exercise its judgment to deny a site review application. Finally, the court concluded that respondent's action was supported by substantial evidence, and respondent did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant's site review application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed the denial of the writ of mandate.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant licensee challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Imperial County (California), which upheld respondent Department of Motor Vehicles' suspension of her driving privilege for one year under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant licensee argued that her driver's license was wrongfully suspended because Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 13352(a)(3) was only applicable to violations of Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23152 punishable under Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23165; the 1982 amendments could not be retroactively applied to suspend her license; and respondent Department of Motor Vehicles' (DMV) reliance on the 1982 amendments to the Vehicle Code constituted the application of an ex post facto law. The court found that only the statutory numbering of the violation was changed by the 1982 amendment, so a conviction under former Cal. Veh. Code &sect; 23102 constituted a conviction under &sect; 23152. The court found that the DMV's application of the 1982 amendment to appellant's second drunk driving offense occurring before the amendment date directly contravened the rule against retroactive application of a statute, absent a clear legislative intent. The court reversed and concluded there was no statutory authority for the DMV to impose a penalty predicated on an act committed before the effective date of the 1982 version of &sect; 13352(a)(3).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant sought review of his conviction of robbery by the Superior Court of San Diego County, (California). Defendant contended his plea of guilty to robbery was void and violated due process because it was the result of presumptive, as well as actual, vindictive prosecution. Defendant also filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, on grounds, of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant pled guilty to robbery of a store and appealed. At the time of his conviction he was serving time for robbery of a gas station, for which he had requested and received the intermediate five-year term, pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1170 (b) and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1204. On appeal defendant contended that the shoe store robbery charge was filed solely in retaliation for defendant's exercise of his legal right to request the intermediate sentence for the gas station robbery. The court affirmed the conviction and denied defendant's petition for habeas corpus. The court held that no connection was found between the two sets of crimes with which defendant was charged, and they were not part of the same act or a course of conduct. The prosecution could have sought defendant's indictment for either robbery at any time before the statute of limitations had run, subject only to the due process constraint requiring the statute of limitations not be invoked to curtail the self-executing constitutional guaranty of the right to a speedy trial. The court also held that defendant was not harmed by his trial counsel's failure to raise the vindictive prosecution defense below.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant's conviction of robbery was affirmed, and his petition for habeas corpus was denied. The court found that vindictive prosecution rules were not applicable to the facts of this case, because the second indictment arose out of separate, distinct, criminal acts. The court also held that the claim of ineffective assistance of counsel failed because defendant was not harmed by counsel's failure to raise a vindictive prosecution defense.</SPAN></P>

It further found that the inquiry into the degree of mental retardation and dangerousness mandated by &sect; 6507 strongly suggested that periodically, treating physicians and other witnesses must be produced in court in order to testify as to the present mental condition and potential danger from the subject. Therefore, the court held that because no qualified expert testified, there was no evidentiary foundation for the jury's finding of mental retardation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant utility taxpayer brought suit in the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California) for a refund of property taxes paid to the respondent county and city, based on an assessment made by respondent State Board of Equalization, on the basis that Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Appellant taxpayer, a public utility which paid property taxes to respondent county based on an assessment by respondent State Board of Equalization (Board) filed a petition with the Board contending that Cal. Const. art. XIII A required a rollback of the assessed value of appellant's property to 1975-1976 values. The Board denied appellant's petitions, and appellant filed suit in the trial court. The trial court granted summary judgment for respondents, and appellant sought review. The court reversed the judgment, holding that although appellant was assessed by the state, the rollback of taxes to 1975-1976 values applied to appellant. Considering article XIII A as a whole, the court held that the phrase &quot;county assessor's valuation&quot; was intended only to designate a specific numerical figure to which property owners could look to determine their new tax basis. The court concluded that Cal. Const. art. XIII A, &sect; 2(a) could reasonably be construed to apply to state-assessed real property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) for attempted robbery with a deadly weapon. The trial court found true the allegation that defendant had previously been convicted of a serious felony under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667, and sentenced defendant to eight years in prison. Defendant appealed, challenging the admission of his prior conviction under the newly-enacted Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(f).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Defendant held a man at knife-point and tried to empty his pockets. Defendant was convicted of attempted robbery with a deadly weapon.  Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 211, 213, and 12022(b). Defendant had previously been convicted of a serious felony under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667, and was sentenced to eight years in prison. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed. The imposition of a five-year enhancement for defendant's prior conviction was proper, even though the enhancement had not been enacted when defendant pleaded guilty in the earlier case. Defendant's prior conviction was properly admitted for impeachment and enhancement purposes under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(f), which effectively abrogated People v. Beagle, 492 P.2d 1 (1972) and its progeny. The court held that any felony, not just a felony implicating truthfulness, is admissible under &sect; 28(f). The court held that &quot;conviction&quot; in &sect; 28(f) meant a constitutionally valid conviction. Defendant's prior conviction should not have been sanitized; the court held that People v. Barrick, 654 P.2d 1243 (1982) had no continuing validity after the effective date of &sect; 28(f).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The court affirmed the conviction. Admission of defendant's prior conviction was proper under the clear mandate of Proposition 8; that proposition abrogated earlier cases circumscribing the circumstances under which prior felony convictions were admissible. The court held that convictions should no longer be sanitized; however, the error in sanitizing defendant's prior conviction actually benefitted defendant and did not require reversal.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that appellant board was unlawfully constituted and that its procedure violated the basic precepts of due process to decide disputes between manufacturers and dealers. There was no provision that the manufacturers be represented on appellant board and the car dealer members could participate in, hear, and comment or advise other members upon any matter. The court found that the disparity in representation of the parties on appellant board created a substantial likelihood and/or appearance of bias rendering respondent board and its decision unconstitutional as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that respondent's practice was not a modification of appellants' contractual right to receive pension payments, but a preexisting term and condition of receiving disability benefits. The court held that withholding payments until receipt of the report did not constitute a seizure, only an enforcement of an existing policy. The court held that reducing payments based on outside income was not unconstitutionally discriminatory under Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 16 or Cal. Const. art.

Veh. Code &sect; 23153. On appeal, he argued that the jury instruction was improper because it shifted the burden to him to prove he was not driving under the influence. The trial court instructed the jury that it should find defendant guilty if there was 0.10 percent or more alcohol in defendant's blood, unless it had reasonable doubt that defendant was under the influence. The court found that the statute establishing the presumption that a driver was under the influence of alcohol based on a chemical analysis of that person's blood or breath was constitutional because there was a rational connection between the fact proved and the ultimate fact presumed. The court also ruled the use of the word &quot;shall&quot; as it affected the burden of proof was a permissive presumption. The instruction made it clear that the prosecution had the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was under the influence and did not impermissibly shift the burden to defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">Respondent landowners filed a petition for the annexation of their uninhabited land to appellant City of San Luis Obispo (City). Respondents' petition complied with the provisions of the Municipal Organization Act of 1977 (MORGA), Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 35000 to 35500. The electorate of appellant City approved a charter, which provided for an election, at which the electorate rejected the annexation. The court affirmed the decision that the charter providing for an election on the proposed annexation was unconstitutional. MORGA embodied the exclusive procedure for annexation of territory to a city and precluded an election by the city voters in uninhabited annexations. MORGA provided for elections only in exceptional circumstances when inhabited territory was annexed and made no provision for an election when uninhabited territory was annexed. It was clearly the legislature's intent to occupy the field of annexation of territory by enacting MORGA, which meant appellant City's charter could not contain provisions pertaining to annexation which were contrary to the general laws of statewide application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c3"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c12">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c13">The decedent was killed in a crash involving one of appellant airline's planes. As the decedent had no dependents at the time of her death, respondent insurance company, which had issued a workers' compensation insurance policy to the decedent's employer, was required, pursuant to Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 4706.5, to pay to the Department of Industrial Relations of the State of California a sum equal to the total dependency death benefit that would have been payable to the decedent's surviving dependent, had such a dependent existed. Thereafter, respondent filed suit against appellant to recover the monies it had paid out. The trial court ruled in respondent's favor. Appellant challenged that judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. Pursuant to Cal. Lab. Code &sect; 3852, as amended, respondent could recover from appellant the money it had paid pursuant to &sect; 4706.5. Under the facts, &sect; 3852 provided an action for indemnity. Although &sect; 4706.5 required respondent to make the payment to the state, rather than the decedent, the payment constituted compensation within the meaning of &sect; 3852, as amended. Section 4706.5 did not impose upon appellant double liability and did not violate equal protection.</SPAN></P>
