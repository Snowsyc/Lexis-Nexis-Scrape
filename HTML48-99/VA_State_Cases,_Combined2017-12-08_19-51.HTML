</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The supplier challenged the validity of &sect; 19-28, which prohibited the use of cloth towels in restaurants within the city, and sought to enjoin the city official from enforcing it. The court reversed the circuit court's dismissal of the supplier's action, remanded the matter for a new trial, and found that &sect; 19-28 was invalid insofar as it prohibited restaurants from using sanitary cloth towels solely because they were not made of paper exclusively. As applied, &sect; 19-28 had no real or substantial relation to the public health, was an unreasonable and arbitrary enactment, provided no reasonable basis for distinction between the two types of towel material, and arbitrarily discriminated in favor of those selling paper towels by giving them an unfair monopoly against those furnishing sanitary cloth towels. A new trial was required because the circuit court failed to determine whether the types of cloth towels that the supplier provided were &quot;common&quot; towels, which were prohibited and which the court defined as any towel, including a &quot;roller towel,&quot; intended or reasonably available for common use by more than one person without being laundered after such use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee arrestee filed a petition challenging the validity of an arrest warrant issued by appellants, the Police Justice of the Town of Herndon, Virginia, and the town, on the ground that the Justice was disqualified to hold office pursuant to Va. Code &sect; 2-27 (1950) because he was an employee of the United States. Appellants challenged a decree of the Circuit Court for the County of Fairfax (Virginia) ruling that &sect; 2-27 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">By their answer, appellants admitted that the Justice was an employee of the United States. However, they averred that his position was that of a clerk within the meaning of Va. Code &sect; 2-29(10) (1950). They argued that by virtue of his clerk status he was excepted from the operation of Va. Code &sect; 2-27 (1950), which forbade an employee of the federal government from holding any office or post of honor, profit, or trust under the Constitution of Virginia. Appellants filed a motion seeking a judgment declaring the right of the Justice to exercise the duties of his office. The trial court indicated its opinion that the Justice was a clerk within the meaning of Va. Code &sect; 2-29(10) (1950), but held that &sect; 2-29(10) was unconstitutional on the basis that it was special or class legislation. The court noted that the effect of the trial court's ruling was to oust the Justice from office. Further, the court recognized that Va. Code &sect; 2-29(14) (1950) had been held constitutional in permitting federal clerks to serve as school trustees. Under the same reasoning and in reversal of the trial court's judgment, the court held that Va. Code &sect; 2-29(10) (1950) was constitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and entered a final decree dismissing the arrestee's petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant applicants challenged the decree of the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (Virginia), which sustained a demurrer to and dismissed their bill filed against appellee State Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors (Board), whereby they sought to enjoin the Board from interfering with them in the conduct of their business as embalmers and funeral directors.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The applicants filed a bill seeking to enjoin the Board from interfering with them in the conduct of their business as embalmers and funeral directors. The bill alleged that each possessed the qualifications required by Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 54-244 and 54-245 to take the examination prescribed therein, and at various times had taken the examination given by the Board, and that the Board had refused to give them a fair examination on their knowledge of sanitation and disinfection of dead bodies. The trial court sustained the Board's demurrer and dismissed the bill. The applicants appealed, and the court reversed the judgment. There was nothing unreasonable or arbitrary in the act regulating the business of embalming or funeral directing. The business was one of a quasi-public nature and concerned the health, safety, and general welfare of the community. Thus, the act was within the General Assembly's police power. This did not, however, permit the Board to discriminate between individuals similarly situated. Thus, if the averments in the applicants' bill were true, the applicants were denied equal protection and the demurrer should not have been sustained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the decree sustaining the Board's demurrer to the applicants' bill in which they sought to enjoin the Board from interfering with them in the conduct of their business as embalmers and funeral directors.

The driver also charged that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46-416.1 (1950, 1952 Supplement) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The driver was convicted on two successive charges of speeding within 12 months and his deposit was forfeited. The commissioner then revoked his operator's and chauffeur's licenses for 60 days and the driver appealed. The trial court upheld the revocations and the court affirmed the judgment below. The court did not agree that &sect; 46-416.1 was unconstitutional, but ruled that the error did not affect the trial court's judgment upholding the revocations. The court rejected the driver's contention that he was never convicted because he was not properly triable under mere summonses. Under &sect;&sect; 19-72.1, 46-193, when a summons was issued for the offenses, there was no need for a formal warrant, and the summons constituted process. It was immaterial whether the driver was before the court on warrants or summonses. A license was also a privilege and not a right. The commissioner had the discretion to revoke the license for abuse of the motor vehicle laws so long as it was not exercised arbitrarily, capriciously, or wrongfully. An appeal process was provided for, and due process was not violated by the commissioner's power in &sect; 46-416.1 to hold a license for a limited time beyond the 60 days.</SPAN></P>

The driver argued that as a desk sergeant to whom he delivered a deposit was not an officer authorized to admit to bail, and because the receipt given to him was not in the form provided, the forfeiture was void, and thus there was no conviction. The court affirmed, finding that process was served acknowledged by the driver when he was arrested. When he delivered the deposit to the sergeant and requested that it be transmitted, it was for his convenience and to relieve him of the necessity of appearing at trial. The driver was charged with the knowledge that the statutes permitted the making of deposits with an authorized officer, provided for their forfeiture for non-appearance, and declared the forfeiture to be a conviction. Precisely what the driver sought to have done was accomplished. In a collateral attack upon the forfeiture and judgment he was in no position to complain of irregularities.

The operator contended that one speeding offense set out in the summons did not charge a criminal offense, the speeding conviction was invalid, the abstract of conviction sent the Commissioner was void, and that &sect; 46-416.1 was unconstitutional. The court disagreed. The offense of &quot;speeding&quot; set out in the summons was sufficient to advise the operator with what he was charged and what he was called upon to defend. The abstract of conviction forwarded to the Commissioner was sufficient. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46-415 and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46-414 prescribed the procedures for forwarding the abstract of conviction. Neither section included any indication that the failure of the clerk of the court to comply with procedures invalidated the conviction or the abstract or precluded entry of an order revoking the operator's licenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant admitted the warrant's allegations and was convicted of violating the ordinance. The court affirmed the judgment overruling his demurrer to the charge. The court found the ordinance to be a valid exercise of the county's police powers. The state's dog laws, Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 29-183 to 29-213, neither withheld the entire field of regulation from localities nor prevented them from enacting ordinances not inconsistent with the state laws. The ordinance was not inconsistent because the state laws were silent on the subject of vicious dogs. Defendant's state license to keep the dog did not prevent the county from supplementing state requirements by exercising its police power to prohibit him from keeping it. Without expressing an opinion on the correctness of the circuit court's ruling on the validity of the third sentence in the ordinance, requiring the destruction of a vicious dog, the court held that the sentence did not vitiate the entire ordinance. The first sentence prohibited the act of keeping a vicious dog, the second sentence fixed the punishment, and the additional penalty fixed by the third sentence did not affect the operation and effect of the remainder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant bottling company brought error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Grayson County (Virginia), which denied it relief from certain local license taxes under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58-1145 assessed against it by appellee town.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The company argued that the ordinance was illegal and unenforceable. The company owned and operated a warehouse in town but did not offer its products for sale there. The maintenance and operation of the distributing house in the town was not a necessary incident to the company's business of selling and delivering its products. The court held that the town was not prohibited by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 58-316 from levying a proper license tax for the operation of the company's warehouse in the town. This ordinance did not impose a tax upon any property of the company but imposed a privilege tax for maintaining and conducting a place of business in the town for the unloading, storing, and reloading of its products for sale and delivery elsewhere. The court held that the company was not engaged in the business of a merchant in the town. It only operated a warehouse in the town. The court rejected the town's argument that the company was a peddler and that a peddler was also a merchant. The company was therefore not liable for the town license taxes assessed against it and was entitled to relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case involved the validity of certain duck blind licenses and the priority of rights as between riparian and non-riparian licensees. Appellee alleged that appellants were hunting from a stationary duck blind located in the public waters of the river in violation of his rights acquired under the duck blind statutes. Appellee sought an injunction preventing appellants from using the blind. Appellants denied that they were violating any of appellee's rights and asserted that the duck blind statutes were unconstitutional because they granted a preference to the riparian owner. The trial court granted the injunction, and appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the statutes did not violate either the Federal or State Constitutions and were reasonable enactments for the conservation of migratory waterfowl, the promotion of better sport, and the protection of hunters and others. The court noted that these provisions were enacted in the exercise of the police power of the state to regulate the killing of waterfowl in the public waters, and in so doing, the legislature offered a limited franchise to all those complying with the provisions.</SPAN></P>

The decree dissolved a temporary injunction that restrained appellee, the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy, from enforcing Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18-89.1, which related to sales of certain items used for the prevention of venereal disease. The decree dismissed the suit, which alleged that &sect; 18-89.1 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Section 18-89.1, which codified an act entitled &quot;an Act to restrict the sale of certain commodities,&quot; prohibited the sale of certain articles intended for the prevention of venereal disease except by licensed medical practitioners or permitted pharmacies. The sale of such articles, including prophylactic rubber goods, by vending machines was prohibited. The vending corporation argued that &sect; 18-89.1 violated its equal protection rights and violated Va. Const. &sect; 52 because the subject of the statute was not expressed in its vague title. The trial court dismissed the vending corporation's suit. On appeal, the court held that, although the title was general in terms, the subjects embraced in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18-89.1 were congruous to and had a natural connection with the subject expressed in the title. The court further held that &sect; 18-89.1 was a valid exercise of police power and promoted the health and morals of the people. Section 18-89.1did not attempt to prohibit sales. Rather, it regulated sales. There was no equal protection violation because the vending company was free to comply with &sect; 18-89.1 and sell the articles. It was merely prohibited from using vending machines.</SPAN></P>

The residents appealed, and the court affirmed the portion of the trial court's judgment that found that the Board was given authority, under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15-10, to adopt the ordinance.

The court held that the primary purpose of the statutes and the taking was the eradication of blighted or deteriorated areas, the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the areas, and the adaptation of them to uses which would prevent a recurrence of the blighted conditions. This was a proper public use, and the fact that the property would later be sold was incidental. The property was not being condemned for a private use.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction in the Circuit Court for the County of Essex (Virginia) for the possession of burglarious tools, with intent to commit burglary and larceny, a violation of Va. Code &sect; 18-159 (1950). Defendant argued that &sect; 18-159 was unconstitutional and void and that the evidence was insufficient to prove possession by him of burglarious tools.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and another were seen in a car watching the outside of a grocery store for several hours. They were again seen watching the store in the middle of the night, and, as they were driving out of town, they were overtaken by police and arrested. The police searched the vehicle and found a revolver, hacksaw blades, gloves, a pick, and other equipment commonly used in burglaries. Defendant admitted that the gun was his, and he was charged with crimes. Defendant was convicted under &sect; 18-159, and he appealed. The court reversed. Section 18-159, when properly construed, violated neither the United States Constitution nor Va. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. However, although the proof of possession of the burglarious tools raised the presumption of criminal intent under Va. Code &sect; 18-159 (1950), the presumption could not be invoked until there was proof of possession, and the Commonwealth did not prove possession. Under &sect; 18-159, a defendant had to possess criminal tools with the intent to commit a crime, and the Commonwealth did not prove intent. This failure was fatal to the Commonwealth's case. Mere suspicion on the part of the police did not establish the necessary criminal intent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and set aside the verdict, and it remanded for a new trial if the Commonwealth was so advised.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the state corporation commission's decision and argued that the notice calling a special meeting of the stockholders of the bank to act upon resolutions adopted by the directors proposing amendments to the charter failed to set out the object and purpose of said special stockholders' meeting. It also found that charters of certain banks to amend by a vote of two-thirds in interest of its stockholders so as to abolish cumulative voting was unconstitutional and void. The court affirmed the state banking commission's decision. The court held that whether the state banking commission was right or wrong in granting the amendment to the charter of the bank created the right of cumulative voting for directors on the consent of less than 90 percent in interest of shareholders, its order was final and conclusive because no appeal was taken from it within the allotted time for appeals.</SPAN></P>

The company brought an equitable action attacking the validity and enforcement of the ordinance, seeking injunctive relief, and requesting a transfer of its action to the law side of the court if the court determined that the company had an adequate remedy at law.

On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant filed a claim against the employer for compensation in connection with his alleged contraction of silicosis while working for the employer. The individual commissioner entered an award in the claimant's favor.

The commission then denied any recovery to the claimant because it found that the claimant had not complied with the 30-day notice requirement of &sect; 65-48. The court reversed the commission's order and remanded the cause to the commission to reinstate the award made by the individual commissioner. The court held (1) that the rights of the parties had to have been determined on appeal before the court under the liberalized provisions of 1952 Va. Acts ch. 205, p. 231, as legislation affecting matters of remedy was retroactive if so expressed and intended; and (2) that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the claimant failed to give notice to the employer within the time required, as the claimant did not experience a distinct manifestation of the disease prior to the date the employer was made aware of his condition.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered a judgment in favor of the county board of supervisors and the related individuals. On appeal, the county treasurer contended that a land area classification of the act was special and arbitrary and contrary to Va.

The court held that: (1) the land area classification in the act very clearly excluded from the operation of the act counties in similar situations to which but for the limitation of area it would apply; and (2) it was, therefore, a special law forbidden by Va. Const. &sect; 63(5) insofar as it undertook to make a classification based on territorial area.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants, the Virginia Commissioner of Motor Vehicles and the Commonwealth's attorney general, challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (Virginia), which held that Va. Code &sect; 46-338.1 was not applicable to appellees, a trucking corporation and its owner. The statute provided penalties for the operation of overweight trucks on state roads.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Truck drivers employed by the trucking company were arrested for operating overloaded trucks owned or controlled by the company. The trucking company had actual and constructive knowledge of the weight laws and permitted the drivers to violate them anyway. The Commonwealth fined the trucking company pursuant to Va. Code &sect; 46-338.1. The trucking company paid the fines into the court under protest. It argued successfully in the circuit court that the statute applied to its drivers and agents but not to the company, which had not been arrested or convicted as the statute required. On appeal, the court construed the remedial statutory scheme liberally in light of the Commonwealth's police power to regulate the weight of commercial trucks on its highways. The court noted that the purposes of the statute, to promote safety and to defray road maintenance, made such laws proper. To penalize only the drivers was not in accord with the statute's intent. The court cited the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles' analysis of the statutory scheme in concluding that the legislature intended its civil remedies to apply against such companies that allowed their agents to violate the weight laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The trailer park company claimed that the tax under the provisions of the Ordinance, Fairfax County, Va., Trailer Park Ordinance &sect; 5 (as amended 1948), had no relationship to the cost of issuing the license and that 1942 Va. Acts ch. 443 was unconstitutional as special legislation that was prohibited by Va. Const. &sect; 63. The court determined that 1942 Va.

The court also determined that the amount of the tax charged by the county for the license, which was required to be obtained by the trailer park company pursuant to the Ordinance, was not in proportion to the administrative costs associated with the license, which violated Va.

Defendant purchased building materials from a supplier for use in making the improvements. The supplier requested several times that defendant make payment for the building materials. Defendant obtained an advance from the homeowner on his contract to make payment to the supplier but instead used the proceeds for other purposes. The supplier reduced his claim to judgment. In seeking review of his conviction, defendant contended that the trial court judgment was contrary to the law and evidence and that &sect; 43-13 was unconstitutional in that it authorized the deprivation of his property without due process and allowed imprisonment for debt. On appeal, the court held that defendant was not punished because he owed the money to the supplier. He was punished for the reason that, with intent to defraud as contractor, he used the funds given to him by the homeowner for some other purpose than to pay the supplier to enable him to carry out his contract, while the debt to the supplier remained unpaid. The imprisonment was on account of the criminal act in not obeying the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The passenger, who was colored, was not permitted to take a seat on a bus, during an intrastate trip, next to a passenger who was white, although other seats were taken. On review, the court found no error. It concluded that the common carrier acted within the laws affecting intrastate transportation. There was no constitutional violation because there was no indication in the record that any occupant of the bus was an interstate passenger.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The service manager of a garage in the county, was killed as the result of a stab wound, which entered his heart, inflicted by defendant. Defendant alleged that over 50 percent of the people in the county were black, but that none were on the jury. On appeal, the court determined that whether defendant was guilty of murder in the first degree was a question for the jury under the evidence as they had a right to view it and the inferences they had a right to draw from it. Defendant stated he was in a position to offer evidence to support the allegations of his motion, and to show that no Negro had been sworn as a member of a petit jury in the court in the last 30 years. While the ultimate issue was whether there had been discrimination in the selection of the jury for the trial of defendant, the evidence offered was admissible, though not necessarily conclusive, on that point. The court held that there was a sufficient offer of relevant evidence that there was discrimination in the selection of the jury for the trial of defendant, and that the failure to receive it was prejudicial error for which the judgment of conviction had to be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that 1934 Va. Acts 357, which created the commission, was constitutional despite the fact that a milk producer and a milk distributor were two of three members.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants contended that (1) the statute unlawfully delegated to private individuals the power of legislation; (2) the composition of the commission in itself was a denial of the right of a fair and unprejudiced hearing and was a denial of due process of law; and (3) there was no existing emergency justifying the use of police power. On appeal, the court held that the statute delegated legislative power to the entire commission, not to the individual members thereof. The court found that price fixing was within the legislative field and it was a general legislative policy to submit technical problems to an experienced and informed tribunal, not only in Virginia, but in most states. The court held that any interest of the members of the commission in the result of the rules, regulations, and orders promulgated by them did not render the law unconstitutional. The court noted that there was an obligation on the members to perform their duties in good faith and that any aggrieved party had a right of appeal to the courts. The court held that the question of &quot;an existing emergency&quot; was not an element to be considered in passing upon the constitutionality of the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellees filed a bill in equity challenging the validity of an ordinance imposing a tax on appellees' real estate to cover the cost of collecting garbage and trash.

After hearing, the trial court sustained the validity of the ordinance and dismissed appellee's bill. Appellants sought review, arguing that the trial court should have sustained their demurrer filed on the ground that appellees had an adequate remedy at law. The court reversed and rendered judgment dismissing appellees' bill. The court noted that Va.

The court found that appellees could have pursued remedies at law pursuant to Va. Code &sect;&sect; 58-1145, 58-1130, or 58-841 (1950).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The lower court ruled that the apartment building owner (owner) was liable under the Sanitation Districts Law of 1938 (Act), Va.

The owner argued on appeal that he was not liable for the charges because he did not use the buildings in that he did not reside there. The court affirmed and held that the owner was liable for the sewer services provided by the sanitation district. Section 1560iii7 of the Act authorized the district to charge for the use of the sewage system. One of the provisions was that the owner of real estate might be charged with the &quot;use&quot; of the sewage disposal system. The court held that an owner who discharged sewage into a system from four apartment buildings was &quot;using&quot; the system. The owner was not compelled to connect with the disposal system. He had the option of providing his own disposal facilities if he chose, but when he connected with the disposal system, he became obligated to pay his portion of the cost.

The trial court confirmed the disallowance of the items and the court affirmed. The court held that a husband was liable for hospital and medical services for his wife and that the debts were his. However, the court held that under the Married Woman's Act, Acts 1876-77, ch. 329, p. 33, the property of the wife was not subject to the debts of the husband.

The property owner filled a bill in equity and sought an injunction to restrain them from acting under the resolution or under &sect; 22(b). The property owner argued that &sect; 22(b) was unconstitutional and void in that it permitted the taking of her property without due process of law in violation of the Va.

The city and the city officials' demurrers were overruled, and the city was perpetually enjoined and restrained from condemning the property for the stated purpose. Upon review, the court modified and then affirmed the decree. The court held that procedure for the taking of the land as outlined in &sect; 22(b) did meet due process requirements. However, the court held that it was proper to enjoin the condemnation proceedings because the joint resolution was defective in that it did not contain an adequate description of the property to be acquired.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act prohibited a city or town from annexing a part of a county unless at least 60 square miles of non-annexed territory remained in the county after annexation. The city alleged that it needed to annex certain land in the county due to necessity and expediency, but that the Act unconstitutionally prevented the annexation because the county contained less than 60 square miles of area. The court held that the Act was a valid exercise of legislative power. Va. Const. &sect; 126 empowered the general assembly to provide by general laws for the extension and contraction of the corporate limits of cities and towns. In no way did &sect; 126 inhibit the assembly from prescribing by general law the minimum number of square miles which, for social, political, or economic reasons, it deemed proper to be embraced in any county. The assembly thus had full power to exercise its wisdom and discretion within reasonable limits.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his conviction asserting that &sect; 3983, as applied to him, an interstate traveler, was an unconstitutional regulation of interstate commerce. The court found that: defendant was travelling as an interstate passenger on a vehicle operated by a common carrier in interstate commerce; he was sitting peaceably in a seat when he was approached by the sheriff, and placed under arrest; no request was made of him to determine whether he had purchased a ticket entitling him to travel beyond the limits of Virginia; and no effort was made to ascertain his status as a passenger. The court found that he was guilty of no disorder, and that he was ejected from the train and arrested solely because he was sitting in a place set aside by the carrier for the exclusive use of white persons. The court recognized that federal courts had held invalid state statutes requiring segregation of the races in interstate commerce as contrary to the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, and have upheld statutes requiring equality of treatment of white and black passengers in interstate commerce as constitutional. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that the burden was upon the claimants to show both title and right of possession in themselves and that they failed to carry this burden. The trial court, therefore, did not err in rejecting a deed from a special commissioner to the claimants' predecessor in title. This rejection caused a gap in the chain of title of the claimants, and the trial court consequently did not err in excluding the prior deeds which were offered in evidence. Their admission in evidence would not have bridged the gap in the title. The court further held that there was nothing to show that the possession of the land by its prior claimants had been hostile or with an intention to hold adversely and that the claimants could not tack their three-years possession to the possession of true owners who held under legal title. Thus, their claim of adverse possession fell short of showing 15 years of adverse possession necessary under the relevant statute.</SPAN></P>

When the trial court upheld the refusal and &sect; 3218's constitutionality, review was sought, and the court affirmed. The court held the refusal had not violated U.S. Const. art.

Moreover, the court validated the refusal because the commissioner's conclusion, that seed oysters would be in short supply, had been fully substantiated. Furthermore, the court held &sect; 3218's prohibition against out-of-state shipping had not unlawfully restrained commerce among the several states because seed oysters, which were subject to the state's riparian rights, were ineligible for shipment in interstate commerce without a permit. Finally, the court held &sect; 3218's tax upon out-of-state shipments was nondiscriminatory, even though it laid no tax upon in-state sales.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the city's limitation on the number of licenses issued to pawnbrokers was authorized by the city's police power and did not result in a monopoly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The pawnbroker filed an application to be licensed as a pawnbroker and for approval of the proposed location of the business. The pawnbroker's personal qualifications and business location complied with the requirements imposed by Va. Tax Code &sect; 191 and the city ordinance, Richmond Code, Va., &sect; 10.266(b) (1947). The city, however, refused the license solely because the ordinance forbid the licensing of any additional pawnshops when there were 12 places duly licensed as pawnshops in the city. The pawnbroker contended that the ordinance violated his equal protection rights, conflicted with the State enabling legislation, and resulted in a monopoly in violation Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4722(5) and 4722(6). The court held that city was authorized to adopt the ordinance under its broad police powers because pawnshops facilitated the commission and concealment of crime. The court also concluded that the restriction in the number of licenses did not violate equal protection where the classification was a reasonable way to promote the public welfare. Finally, the court found that grant of an exclusive privilege to a limited number of pawnshops did not violate the statutory ban on monopolies.</SPAN></P>

The city issued warrants for the violations, and the appliance seller was convicted. The appliance seller filed a writ of error, and the court affirmed the judgment, holding that the ordinances were not so vague, indefinite, or uncertain that they were invalid. Although the ordinances did not define the terms pertaining to the levels of plumbing expertise, the ordinary meaning of the words and their construction by city officials led the court to the conclusion that they were not too vague to be enforced. Further, the city, under its police power, had the authority to regulate the activities of plumbers because they bore a proper relation to the health and safety of the public. Finally, the court found no evidence that the ordinances were unconstitutionally discriminatory because they simply required that only licensed persons perform plumbing work and that a license could only be obtained by passing an examination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Act was an amendment to the Code of Virginia that added a new section. The effect of the Act was to change the method of selection of the county school board. Instead of being appointed by the school trustee electoral board, the Act provided for election by county voters. The appointed school board members contended that the amendment was a local or special law for conducting elections in violation of Va. Const. &sect; 63. They also contended that the amendment violated Va. Const. &sect; 64, which prohibited any amendment of a general law that operated directly or indirectly to enact, or that had the effect of the enactment of, a special, private, or local law. The court on appeal held that Va. Const. &sect; 63 merely forbade local laws for conducting elections and designating the places of voting. It was not intended as a restriction upon the power of the General Assembly to provide what offices in a county should be filled by election. Moreover, chapter 61 had not amended any particular Code section or any particular statute. It was an amendment to the Code of Virginia as a whole, by adding a new section.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The comptroller entertained doubt of the constitutionality of the State Revenue Bond Act (Act).

Therefore, the attorney general filed the mandamus action. The court rejected the comptroller's assertions that the state's acquisition and operation of ferries and issuance of bonds were violative of the state constitution. The court examined the provisions of the Act as a whole and determined that it imposed no debts or liabilities upon the state, and therefore did not violate the terms of Va.

Appellants challenged the decision on jurisdictional grounds arguing that they had conducted no business activities within the state and service of notice outside the state by registered mail was not sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the Commission. On appeal, the court held the Commission had jurisdiction of appellants because actual presence in a state was not necessary to make a person amenable to its laws for a crime committed in that state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission assessed the value of certain real estate and tangible personal property belonging to the power company. Instead of assessing the properties for taxation for the city at their fair market value, the commission assessed them at only 40 percent of their value. This commission applied a state-wide equalizing factor in order to conform to the average ratio of counties and cities of the entire state. The city filed an application for review and correction of the assessment value, asserting that the commission's assessment at less than actual market value violated Va. Const. &sect;&sect; 168 and 169, concerning assessments of properties. The commission denied the application. On review, the court affirmed the order, and held that Virginia Constitution required only that the taxes be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax. The court reasoned that both the commission and the state constitution recognized a different system of taxation for taxing railroads in relation to other properties. The difference in classification did not offend principles of equal protection or the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The court found that defendant was soliciting a subscription to a magazine published by his employer, which expressed opinions and disseminated ideas. The ordinance within the scope of its language as interpreted by the trial court permitted the punishment of incidents fairly within the protection of the guarantee of a free press. The court held that, as applied to defendant's conduct, &sect; 886 was void and defendant could not be punished for acting without a permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner Virginia Attorney General filed a petition for writ of mandamus that sought the proper construction, interpretation, or constitutionality of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2672(20) of the Virginia Retirement Act, and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 643 of the Virginia Literary Fund Act, when respondents, State Treasurer and Controller, refused to make payments from the state treasury to the literary fund because of the prohibition found in Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Amendments to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2672(20) of the Virginia Retirement Act, and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 643 of the Virginia Literary Fund Act, allowed the Board of Trustees of the state retirement system to purchase securities from the State Board of Education, with reserve assets of the retirement fund, made out to the literary fund and then loaned to and for the benefit of county schools. The court in holding the amendments unconstitutional and inoperative, and so denying the Virginia Attorney General's petition for writ of mandamus, looked to the substance of the transactions and not their mere form, and concluded that there was no escaping the prohibition contained in Va. Const. &sect; 115-a, that forbade a county from incurring long-term bonded debt except upon proper referendum. The court reasoned that the character of the funds even if channeled through the literary fund, were still assets of the retirement fund. Next, the court held that the obligations imposed upon the counties would have been debts even if by statute their negotiability were limited. Although the purpose of the amendments was laudatory, the court concluded that did not permit circumventing &sect; 115-a.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant refused to pay the tax on real estate purchased by him, and he was proceeded against in a civil and police court upon a criminal warrant. He was found guilty, a fine was imposed upon him, and he appealed his case to the lower court. The lower court reversed the decision, and dismissed the charges. Defendant asserted that the City had no right to appeal his acquittal. The court agreed. Va. Const. &sect; 8 provided that no person was to be put twice in jeopardy for the same offense. Under Va. Const. &sect; 88, no appeal was to be allowed the Commonwealth in a case involving the life or liberty of a person except that an appeal by the Commonwealth was allowed in any case involving the violation of a law relating to state revenue. Under the facts, the liberty of defendant was involved and the revenue of the State was not involved, as the tax at issue was purely local. Thus, under &sect; 88, the court was plainly denied appellate jurisdiction to consider the case. Additionally, the court held that if it was to grant the request of the City and was to re-hear, reverse, and annul the judgment, the result would have effectively placed defendant twice in jeopardy for the same offense.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 4533a (1942).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of violating &sect; 4533a. She contended, among other things, that the evidence was insufficient to show that she was guilty of any disorderly conduct. The court reasoned that the request of the bus driver that defendant move her seat was based on a rule of the carrier and not on any provision of law. Defendant's refusal to obey the request constituted, at most, a breach of the carrier's rules and regulations. As such, it related only to the dealings and acts of private persons, namely the carrier and defendant. The legislature alone had the power to define crimes against the Commonwealth. That power could not be delegated to the courts, or to individuals, or to corporations. Section 4533a did not purport to delegate any such authority to a common carrier. It was clear that defendant was requested to move her seat because of her race and color. She was sitting peaceably in her seat when she was approached by the operator of the bus. She had not disturbed any person, or caused any commotion affecting, in any degree, the peace or good order of the bus. She was guilty of no definite misbehavior or misconduct in the sense that she was disorderly or turbulent.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the assignment of counsel was not proper to meet the due process of law requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment. On appeal, the court held that there was nothing to indicate that defendant's counsel was ineffective or that defendant was denied due process. The court stated that the record failed to show that defendant did not have the time or opportunity to secure counsel if he so desired or that counsel was appointed for him at such a late date as to preclude the giving of effective aide in the preparation and trial of the case. The court found no evidence that defense counsel was lacking in skill, ability, or diligence, or that anything would have been gained by a postponement or continuance.

Police were advised that several of the school's cadets might have been sexually abused by defendant. The police conducted an investigation and obtained a warrant to search defendant's apartment. Officers executing the search warrant seized a number of defendant's diaries, looking for information involving sexual preferences or acts with certain people. Defendant was indicted on sixteen counts of taking indecent liberties with two minors under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-370.1. Prior to trial, defendant moved to suppress the excerpts taken from his diaries, arguing that admission of the excerpts would violate U.S. Const. amends. IV and V. The trial judge denied the motion. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge convicted defendant of fourteen of the charges. Defendant appealed. The court held that admission of defendant's personal diaries at trial violated defendant's rights against self-incrimination under U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>

After his girlfriend spurned him, defendant showed the estranged husband the rifle and silencer, warning him that his wife wanted him dead. Defendant was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder and attempted possession of an unregistered firearm muffler or silencer. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction, finding that the language of Va.

The court found that the evidence was sufficient to show that appellant was aware of the presence and character of the imitation controlled substance and that it was subject to his dominion and control.

The parties disputed whether the children should be home-schooled or sent to parochial school, and the decision was eventually vested in appellee by the trial court. Appellant's motion was based on various allegations regarding appellee's attempts to exclude her from the children's lives, her desire for the children to attend parochial school rather than home-schooling, and inappropriate parenting. The court held the trial court's decision was not an abuse of discretion. The trial court was not required to elaborate on its consideration of the various factors regarding determination of custody set forth in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-124. The evidence in the record supported the trial court's ruling that circumstances had not materially changed and it was thus affirmed. The children's preferences did not control custody determination and was merely one factor to be considered.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of sodomy involving a 16-year-old victim, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-361. On appeal, he contended the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment. Appellant asserted that the statute violated his constitutional right to privacy and must be narrowly construed to exclude private acts of consensual heterosexual sodomy, and that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged his conviction for sodomy for engaging in non-consensual oral sex with a minor. Appellant sought on appeal to extend the recognized right to privacy to cover an individual who engaged in heterosexual sodomy. However, the reviewing court held that appellant's actions were not within the ambit of any constitutionally protected zone because they did not involve sexual relations between two consenting adults. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence established that appellant acted without the consent of the 16-year-old victim. Given the nature of the relationship of the parties and the attendant circumstances, the court agreed with the trial court's determination that appellant's actions constituted &quot;unwanted, non-consensual contact&quot; with the victim and that his actions did not reach the level of constitutional protection. Because the evidence established that the relations in the case were non-consensual, the court declined to decide the constitutionality of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-361, as it applied to heterosexual acts between two consenting adults. Additionally, the statute at issue was not unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's conviction for sodomy was affirmed. The court declined to assess the constitutionality of the relevant statute because the relations in the case were non-consensual, and involved a minor. The language of the statute gave defendant reasonable notice that his conduct was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

A three-judge panel of the court reversed and remanded for resentencing. The Commonwealth of Virginia sought review and the court granted a rehearing en banc.

The court found that its review of the denial of appellant's claim asked only whether there was substantial evidence in the agency record to support the agency's holding. Applying this standard, the court found that the agency was entitled to believe as it did the opinions of two doctors and lend less weight to another doctor's opinions, and that the opinions of the doctors whom the agency believed, when considered with the entire record, were adequate to support the agency's decision. Therefore, court found that the trial court did not err in affirming the denial of benefits. Court found that it was barred from considering appellant's argument that Va.

The court held that the effective date was a matter left to the discretion of the circuit court. The court held that the evidence supported the circuit court's decisions concerning modification of the presumptive amount of child support. The court held that orthodontic expenses were extraordinary medical and dental expenses, and could be incorporated into the child support calculation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellants sought review of decision affirming denial of their claims for permanent disability retirement, contending that trial court erred in finding that they failed to prove their disabilities were likely to be permanent, and that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 51.1-156 was vague, as it did not provide for adequate standards to guide a determination of whether a person was permanently impaired. The court held in reviewing decisions it would not retry the facts, reweigh preponderance of the evidence, or make its own determination of the credibility of the witnesses. Employing that standard, the court held, despite the contradictory testimony provided by expert witnesses, the evidence was sufficient to support appellee Virginia Retirement System's (VRS) determination that appellants were not permanently impaired. Testimony by physicians and psychiatrists demonstrated the psychiatric or non-permanent nature of appellants' existing medical problems. Therefore, the trial court did not err in upholding appellee VRS decisions. The court held that appellants' constitutional challenge of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 51.1-156 was barred because appellants only raised the challenge for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed in all three cases. Evidence was sufficient to support appellee VRS determination that appellants were not permanently impaired. Testimony by physicians and psychiatrists demonstrated the psychiatric or non-permanent nature of appellants' existing medical problems. Appellants' constitutional challenge of statutory guidelines was barred because appellants only raised the challenge for the first time on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (Virginia), which convicted defendant of obstruction of justice in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-460(A) and for grand larceny in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-95.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was pulled over by a state trooper. The trooper requested identification and a registration for the vehicle. Defendant advised the trooper that he did not have identification and he falsely identified himself and provided the trooper with an address, birth date, and incorrect Social Security number. Defendant told the trooper that the vehicle was owned by a friend and advised him where the friend could be found. Further investigation disclosed that the vehicle was stolen, and defendant was arrested. Subsequently, the trooper pursued the information provided by defendant regarding the friend and found no one occupied the premises provided by defendant. The court determined that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for obstruction of justice. Court held that defendant's false statements burdened the trooper, but did not prevent the officer from performing his duty. Further, the court affirmed the conviction for grand larceny. The court found, based on the record, that there was sufficient evidence to establish that defendant exclusively possessed the stolen car.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the lower court's obstruction of justice conviction because defendant's conduct did not prevent the officer from performing his duty in a fashion which implied opposition or resistance by direct action and forcible threatened means. The court affirmed the lower court's grand larceny conviction because the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions for rape, second or subsequent offense, sodomy by cunnilingus, second offense, sodomy by fellatio, second or subsequent offense, and attempted anal sodomy were affirmed on appeal. The court held defendant's prior convictions were properly admitted because an enhanced sentence was sought. The court found defendant's convictions under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 261, admissible because they were properly authenticated, and substantially conformed to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-61. The court found the trial court was not forced to accept defendant's qualified stipulations. The trial court properly refused to set aside the verdict because defendant failed to timely object that the indictment failed to set forth a crime. The court ruled that the trial court had discretion to deny motions to strike two jurors because evidence supported its ruling. The court found Va. Code &sect; 18:2-67.5:3 was constitutional and proportionate to second offenses for violent sexual assaults. The court found the taped conversation was admissible because defendant opened the door, and it was relevant and material. The court found the evidence supported defendant's conviction for sodomy by cunnilingus.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's convictions for rape, and various forms of sodomy were affirmed because the evidence supported the court's rulings, and defendant's prior convictions were admissible in sentence enhancement. Defendant's mandatory life sentence was constitutional and proportionate to the convictions. Evidence supported the conviction for sodomy by cunnilingus, and the tape was admissible because it was relevant and defendant opened the door for it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant challenged an order of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County (Virginia), which convicted him of violating Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-386.1(A), for his actions of videotaping under a victim's dress. Appellant contended that the trial court erred in making its decision for several reasons, including the finding that his conduct violated the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At a county fair, appellant placed a bag carrying a videocamera near the feet of the victim so that the camera lens pointed up a victim's dress. Police later confiscated the videotape, which contained a view of the victim's undergarments. Appellant was convicted of violating Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-386.1(A). Appellant challenged, arguing that his conduct did not violate &sect; 18.2-386.1(A), amongst other contentions. The court agreed with appellant on that assertion and did not consider his other assignments of error. The court held that the statutory language demonstrated a legislative intent to deter the unauthorized photography of persons in a state of undress while in private locations rather than persons standing in public locations like a county fair in which no reasonable expectation of privacy could be had. The court also held it would be a strained construction to conclude that the legislature intended to proscribe the videotaping of a fully clothed victim in a public site. Although appellant's conduct was reprehensible, the court reversed and dismissed his conviction as it violated sound principles of statutory construction to hold that his conduct violated &sect; 18.2-386.1(A).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant's conviction for violating statute by placing videocamera at the feet of a victim attending a county fair so as to videotape her undergarments was reversed and dismissed. The court agreed with appellant that his conduct did not violate the statute as it would have been a strained statutory construction to hold that the statute applied to persons standing in public locations like a county fair and who were fully clothed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the Circuit Court of the City of Danville (Virginia), which convicted defendant in a bench trial of two counts of grand larceny by check in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-181.1. Defendant claimed on appeal that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew his account had insufficient funds, or that he intended to defraud the merchants who received the checks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant opened a bank account with an initial deposit which was withdrawn in a series of transactions during the first week. The bank mailed notice of the overdraft to defendant's last known address. Defendant continued writing to checks to two merchants which were returned unpaid. Both merchants wrote defendant at his last known address and demanded payment. Defendant was found guilty of two counts of grand larceny by check in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-181.1. Defendant appealed claiming that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he knew the checks were worthless. The court affirmed, relying on the statutory presumption provided by &sect; 18.2-183 that writing a bad check constituted prima facie evidence of an intent to defraud unless defendant made the checks good within five days of receipt of a written notice. The statute further provided that written notice by certified mail to the last known address of the maker was deemed to be sufficient notice. Both the bank and two merchants had given adequate notice to establish the statutory presumption. The court was entitled to disbelieve defendant's testimony that he had moved and did not receive the notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for grand larceny by check because it found that the evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant knew that his account lacked sufficient funds. The evidence that defendant had withdrawn all the money he had deposited within a week and that the failed to make good checks returned for insufficient funds after notice was given was sufficient to establish defendant's knowledge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his motion for a bill of particulars to specify under Va.

Code &sect; 18.2-48, what force defendant used to seize the victim and for what purpose he abducted her. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence showed that, on the date in question, defendant did not have permission to be in the victim's home. Although the evidence adduced at a preliminary hearing would not have served as a substitute for a bill of particulars, even without a bill of particulars, defendant was apprised of the specific time of the offense, and had not shown that he was prejudiced by the trial court's failure to require a bill of particulars. In light of a lesser conviction and because defendant had alleged no specific prejudice from the trial court's denial of his request for disclosure of the specific intent elements that the Commonwealth intended to prove, the court held that the trial court's error, if any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on two related cocaine offenses in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond (Virginia). The trial court imposed additional punishment for each offense in the form of a suspended term of post-release incarceration, which was conditioned upon his successful completion of a period of post-release supervision. Defendant appealed his sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court, pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-10, sentenced defendant to a suspended post-release term of three years on each cocaine offense. Pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295.2(A), the trial judge imposed a three-year term of post-release supervision on each charge. Defendant argued that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295.1, which provided for bifurcated jury sentencing, gave an accused a due process right to be sentenced by a jury, thereby rendering unconstitutional the provisions of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295.2, which permitted the imposition of a post-release suspended sentence and supervision. The appellate court ruled that the Virginia Legislature intended the procedures outlined in VA. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295.1 for the jury's ascertainment of punishment to be subject to (1) the provisions of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295, which required the jury's sentence to be within the limits prescribed by law; (2) the provisions of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-295.2; and (3) the provisions of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-303, which permitted the trial court to suspend some or all of a sentence and impose probation. As construed, Va.

Code Ann. &sect; 65.2-402(B), the Workers' Compensation Act's (Act) provision regarding occupational disease.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The claimant worked as a police officer. He sought medical and temporary total disability benefits stemming from heart disease. The court found that the commission had subject matter jurisdiction over the claim because the General Assembly expressly empowered the commission with jurisdiction to determine all questions arising under the Act if not settled. The court also found that the communication date of claimant's diagnosis was the date his doctor told him that &quot;stress on the job&quot; was among the contributing factors. The court, however, vacated the commission's finding that employer failed to rebut the presumption of &sect; 65.2-402(B). The co-existence of both the Thayer theory and the Morgan theory regarding presumptions meant that there was no single rule in Virginia regarding the effect of all presumptions. Rather, the effect of a presumption depended upon the pursue for the creation of the presumption. The &sect; 65.2-402(B) presumption acted like the presumption against suicide; it did not just disappear when evidence was offered in opposition to it. Instead, it had the effect of shifting the burdens of production and persuasion on the issue of causation to the employer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the commission's conclusion that it had subject matter jurisdiction over claimant's claim and its finding that the communication date of claimant's diagnosis was the date that the claimant was diagnosed by his doctor. The court vacated the commission's finding that employer failed to rebut the presumption. The court remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

Defendant himself said he did not drive any forklifts, but admitted to acting as a lookout. Defendant was charged with unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. Prior to trial, defendant pleaded not guilty. At trial, defendant cross-examined witnesses for the Commonwealth, moved to strike the evidence, presented witnesses, and testified. On direct examination by his attorney, defendant admitted his participation in the unauthorized use of the forklifts. Defendant then changed his plea to a plea of no contest. The trial court accepted the change. After defendant was found guilty, the appellate found he could not argue for the first time on appeal that his no contest plea was not knowingly, freely, and intelligently entered. It also found that the &quot;ends of justice&quot; exception allowing him to raise that argument despite not having raised it in the trial court did not apply as no miscarriage of justice had occurred.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-299(C), which authorized reference in the reports to a defendant's known association in illicit drug operations, was unconstitutional. Because the trial court refused her motion to identify the informants, she claimed that she was compelled to testify at the sentencing in violation of her right against self-incrimination. She also alleged that the refusal to identify the informants violated her right to confrontation and her procedural due process rights. The court affirmed the judgment, emphasizing the heavy burden one faced in challenging the constitutionality of a statute. Because defendant was not compelled to testify at the sentencing hearing, her right against self-incrimination was not implicated. The right to confrontation did not apply to post-trial sentencing hearings, and because the information in the presentence report had an indicia of reliability, its consideration did not infringe any due process rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that Suffolk County, Va., Code &sect; 18-11.1 under which he was convicted for public nudity was overbroad, vague, and that the trial court erroneously denied defendant standing to rely upon such constitutional principles. On appeal, the court affirmed finding that since defendant admitted that he did not intend to expose himself to others while he was nude in his yard, his conduct had no expression or communicative purposes, and therefore did not implicate the First Amendment. The court held that since &sect; 18-11.1 was subsequently repealed, the former version that defendant alleged was overbroad could not chill protected expression in the future. Therefore, the court determined that the overbreadth question had become moot and it did not address it. With respect to defendant's vagueness claim, the court noted that defendant had prior experience with the original public nudity ordinance on no fewer than three occasions which clearly informed him that the conduct at issue was proscribed by law. Consequently, the court rejected defendant's vagueness challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the rulings of the Circuit Court of Henrico County (Virginia), which convicted her of welfare fraud. The trial court denied a pretrial motion to waive assessment of a jury fee and other fees on the grounds that the fees had an unconstitutional effect of chilling the indigent's right to a jury. The trial court heard the case without a jury and assessed various fees without expressly ruling on a post-sentence objection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant waived a jury after the trial court refused to waive the jury fee, but never expressly claimed the waiver was involuntary. Upon conviction, the trial court imposed statutory fees for the services of the Commonwealth's attorney, the clerk, the court reporter, and the use of the courthouse. On appeal, the court held that the legislature had a valid objective to obtain reimbursement of the direct expenses of a criminal prosecution from the convicted criminal who caused the expense. The court agreed that the objective could not be pursued by means that needlessly chilled the exercise of basic constitutional rights, but held that the test was whether the effect was unnecessary and excessive. The court found that the state's system, which required the trial court to assess a defendant's ability to pay, to tailor a payment plan that would avoid hardship, and to re-examine the plan on motion of any party, was not unconstitutional. The court noted that defendant had waived the issues of the voluntariness of her jury waiver, the directness of the costs assessed, and her post-sentence objection by a failure to preserve them in the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the convictions of defendant for welfare fraud that included the imposition of statutory fees by the trial court.</SPAN></P>

He moved to suppress the seized evidence, contending that his waiver of his Fourth Amendment rights was invalid. The trial court denied the motion to suppress and the court affirmed. Defendant, while represented by counsel, acknowledged that the plea agreement, including the waiver, was made knowingly and voluntarily. Further, defendant understood the consequences of the waiver, it was his voluntary act, and was not the result of coercion. The court found that although defendant exhibited a subjective expectation of privacy over the controlled substances and the handgun in his backpack, he had divested himself of the right to such an expectation when he knowingly and voluntarily waived his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>

Under &sect; 18.2-346, the solicitation of another to commit oral sodomy for money was a misdemeanor, while under &sect; 18.2-29, the solicitation of another to commit a felony, which included oral sodomy, was a felony. On appeal, defendant contended that the statutory scheme violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the police department had selectively enforced the criminal solicitation statute against male homosexuals. The court disagreed and affirmed. The persons affected by the statutes were not similarly situated. While both statutes prohibited solicitation to engage in sodomy, &sect; 18.2-346 was directed at those who did so for remuneration and &sect; 18.2-29 was directed at those who did so without a request or demand for remuneration. By recognizing different motivations, the statutes created separate classifications of prohibited conduct. Also, defendant failed to present persuasive evidence of selective enforcement.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">At issue was whether the doctrine of res judicata precluded the commonwealth from indicting the defendant on the same offense when the original warrant had been dismissed.

Based on that ruling, defendant's motion to dismiss the DWI charge was granted, then the commonwealth issued a new indictment for the same charge, and defendant was convicted. On appeal, the court reversed defendant's conviction. The court held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel and the doctrine of res judicata applied to criminal cases and in particular, to pre-trial dispositions of issues. The court held that because the second indictment was for the same act and that had been disposed of in a previous hearing, the commonwealth was precluded from indicting defendant a second time.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was adjudicated an habitual offender. He was later charged with driving after having been declared an habitual offender, first offense. Before he was convicted of that charge, defendant was arrested for having driven after having been declared an habitual offender, second offense. At trial, the Commonwealth of Virginia was permitted to amend the indictment to read that defendant, having been declared an habitual offender, had committed a second or subsequent offense. Defendant claimed that he could not have been convicted because the first offense was still pending and the indictment should not have been allowed to be amended. The court held that the conviction was proper. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-357(B)(3) was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The plain language of &sect; 46.2-357(B)(3) clearly provided that any subsequent offense of &sect; 46.2-357 subjected defendant to its enhanced punishments, regardless of whether he was convicted of the earlier offense when the subsequent offense occurred. The fact that there were mitigating circumstances in &sect; 46.2-357 did not make the statute ambiguous. The amendment of the indictment was proper because it was only a semantic change.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's contentions that &sect; 18.2-60.3 was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, both on its face and as applied to him. The court additionally found no merit in defendant's argument that the statute chilled protected speech.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant father challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of the City of Virginia Beach (Virginia), which upheld a decision appellee Virginia Department of Social Services' finding of emotional abuse by him against two of his children. The father contended that substantial evidence did not exist in the record to support the agency's findings, that there were procedural errors, and that the trial court erred in not applying res judicata.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Two of the children made statements in two separate interviews with a school counselor and a family therapist. The statements chronicled various acts by the father, all of which contributed to the emotional abuse inflicted upon his children. The specific behaviors and their effects on the children were well documented in the local agency's investigation, at the local agency's conference, and at the state agency's hearing. The court found that the agency's findings were supported in the record and that the trial court should have reversed the agency's decision only if procedural errors infected the entire agency proceedings with unfair prejudice. Because the court could not conclude that a different procedure at any level created an unfair prejudice to the father, errors made by the agency, if any, were harmless. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that the res judicata argument lacked any merit. The order cited was by a lower court, which did not rule that no abuse occurred. That proceeding was on a different issue between parties different than the ones in the instant case. The principle of res judicata had no place in the matter.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 19.2-187, 19.2-187.1 violated defendant's right to confrontation guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">When defendant was arrested, police officers recovered a bag containing a white substance from the front of defendant's pants. The drugs were forwarded to the Division of Forensic Science. At defendant's trial for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, the commonwealth filed a motion to introduce the certificate of analysis of the white substance taken from defendant at the time of his search and arrest. The commonwealth sought to use the certificate to show that arresting officer submitted one plastic bag containing caked tan powder for analysis and that a forensic scientist analyzed the substance and determined it to be cocaine. The trial court overruled defendant's objection and he was convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction. The rights granted to defendant under the Confrontation Clause were not violated by admitting into evidence against him the certificate of analysis which fell within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. Defendant had the express statutory right to subpoena the chemist performing the analysis to testify at trial and be available for his examination and defendant chose not to avail himself of that process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court held that a trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter a criminal judgment if the judgment was predicated upon an unconstitutional or otherwise invalid statute or ordinance and the court deemed it appropriate to raise the jurisdictional issue sua sponte. The court applied well-established principles concerning the retroactive application of new rules for criminal prosecutions and held that equity required that any new rules must apply to all cases still pending on direct review with no exception for cases in which the new rule constituted a clear break with the past, based on the theory that courts did not make new law but rather found it. The court rejected the Commonwealth's arguments that defendant had procedurally defaulted by not raising the issue at trial or on appeal because the issue went to the jurisdiction of the trial court. The court held that the jurisdictional bar extended to a conviction obtained prior to the date of the constitutional decision, but that was still pending on direct review.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of two offenses of cocaine possession with intent to distribute, two related firearm charges, and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. It held that where defendant's appearance was consistent with the description of the person named in the warrants, and his comments were suggestive of an impending narcotics transaction, the police acted both in good faith and reasonably in arresting him. The court also held that defendant's possession of cocaine at the informant's trailer and the constructive possession of like narcotics at the home he shared with another constituted two distinct criminal offenses subject to cumulative punishments.

Rejecting defendant's interpretation of Va.

Therefore, the trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to set aside the challenged convictions as violative of the double jeopardy prohibition. Affirming defendant's convictions, the court held that two certified conviction orders from a Tennessee court signed by the deputy clerk complied with the requirements of Va.

He argued that the wording &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; as used in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-817 was unconstitutionally vague and, therefore, violated his right to due process. The court disagreed. The court held that a word in a statute was to be given its everyday, ordinary meaning unless the word was a word of art. Applying the two-pronged test standard, the court determined that the phrase &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. Section 46.2-817 satisfied the two-pronged void-for-vagueness analysis because: (1) ordinary individuals were placed on notice as to what behavior was proscribed, and (2) the language was specific enough so that it did not unduly encourage arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. Moreover, the phrase &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; had been used in other Virginia statutes and case law.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court held that &sect; 18.2-308.2 was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law. The court found that defendant had properly been sentenced as an adult in 1969. The court determined that the trial court had properly used the 1969 conviction as the predicate felony.

The purpose behind the registration requirement was not penal in nature but instead served the purposes of assisting law enforcement and protecting children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was arrested when an officer observed her and her boyfriend purchase drugs from their vehicle, in which defendant's three-year-old twins sat as passengers, and place the drugs in a cigarette pack on the dashboard, within reach of the children, as defendant and her boyfriend exited the vehicle to purchase fast food. The Commonwealth argued that the evidence proved defendant violated the part of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 40.1-103 that provided that a person having custody of a child could not willfully or negligently cause or permit such child to be placed in a situation that its life, health, or morals could be endangered. The court held that even viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence did not support defendant's conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. The facts did not prove that defendant's actions could have endangered the life, health or morals of her children. No evidence showed that either defendant or her boyfriend ingested the drugs before or while operating the vehicle, or that the children understood their mother had just purchased illegal drugs and the moral significance associated thereto.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that &sect; 40.1-103 was unconstitutionally vague as applied to her. Defendant argued that the first clause of the statute failed to define adequately the mens rea element upon which criminal liability for the proscribed conduct was based. On appeal, the court disagreed with defendant's contention. The court found that defendant was charged with willfully or negligently subjecting her child not to a possibility of endangerment, but to an actual condition of endangerment. The court held that the first clause of the statute defined readily understandable proscribed conduct and was constitutional. As to defendant's other contention that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on simple negligence, the court agreed with defendant. The court held that because &sect; 40.1-103 was a criminal statute, it required proof of a greater degree of negligence than was required in a civil action. The court determined that the negligence had to be so gross and culpable as to indicate a callous disregard of human life and of the probable consequences of the act.

The court held that the dismissal of the case was appealable because the trial judge dismissed a &quot;charge.&quot; The court further held that the felony language that contained the term &quot;serious bodily injury&quot; was not unconstitutionally vague. In determining the validity of the statute, the court looked to other code sections that employed the same phraseology. The court held that with such widespread use of the term, it was plain that it did have a common and well-recognized meaning.

He was not entitled to interest under &sect; 65.2-713 because the employer's reasonable defense to the claim provided grounds to delay the benefit payments, and interest was not payable under &sect; 65.2-707 because the appeal did not delay the payments.

He did not request attorneys' fees or costs on remand to the Commission, and the court declined to consider his request for them for the first time on appeal.

Defendant challenged his conviction and argued that the city ordinance was void because it provided for a lesser punishment than Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-270. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and concluded that he could not challenge the validity of the city ordinance. The court found that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-270 provided an enhanced penalty for driving under the influence while transporting a person 17 years or younger. At the time of defendant's arrest, the city had not amended its ordinance to include the enhanced penalty offense provided in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-270. The court determined that the record contained no evidence suggesting that defendant had been transporting a person 17 years of age or younger or that the trial court had considered that offense. The court found that the enhanced penalty did not apply to defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant sought review, claiming that the evidence was insufficient and challenging &sect; 18.2-58.1's constitutionality. Upon review, the court rejected the contention that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction because, at the time defendant took the keys, the victim was not in &quot;possession or control&quot; of her car. In rejecting this contention, the court held that the victim's possession of the keys placed her in possession or control of the car. In so holding, the court noted that a person's possession of the means to exercise dominion or control over an item gave that person dominion or control over the item itself. The court also rejected the contention that &sect; 18.2-58.1 was unconstitutionally vague. In rejecting this contention, the court held that &sect; 18.2-58.1's scope was not beyond the ken of a person of ordinary intelligence and that understanding the statutory terms &quot;possession and control&quot; required no superior intellectual attributes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal from his criminal convictions, defendant contended that the peremptory strikes exercised by the Commonwealth during jury selection were violative of the Equal Protection Clause because the strikes were gender-based and age-based.

On the remaining questions presented, the trial court's rulings and judgment were affirmed. The case was remanded. While age was a permissible basis upon which to exercise a peremptory strike, the peremptory exclusion of potential jurors on the basis of their gender constituted a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.

The court held that the provision in &sect; 40.1-103 prohibiting the willful or negligent causing or permitting minors in their care to be placed in a situation such that their life, health, or morals may be endangered was unconstitutionally vague because it criminalized acts that might harm and because the prosecution of such acts would be guided by subjectivity and personal predilection.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Commonwealth tendered certified copies of two previous orders of conviction for driving under the influence. The first order recited an uncounseled 1983 conviction, with a suspended sentence. The evidence was admitted in the sentencing phase of the trial. The second order recited a 1985 conviction for which defendant was sentenced to 180 days in jail (178 suspended). The trial court concluded that defendant had been represented by counsel and admitted the 1985 conviction at the guilt and sentencing phases. On appeal, defendant contended that the 1985 conviction was invalid because he was uncounseled and the sentence imposed two days' imprisonment. The court reversed and remanded. On rehearing, the court concluded that defendant had not been represented by counsel at the 1985 trial and affirmed the trial court judgment. Because the 1983 conviction involved no imprisonment, that conviction could have been used in both the guilt and sentencing phases of the trial. The 1985 conviction was valid, although uncounseled and having resulted in imprisonment, and the trial court properly considered it in the guilt phase because the conduct had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that because &quot;goods, materials and equipment&quot; were not defined in the statute at issue, the statute was unconstitutionally vague and overly broad. On appeal, the court found that the statute, when read in its entirety and in conjunction with the language in the city's zoning ordinance, showed that the statute was reasonably definite in its scope as to the prohibited conduct and, therefore, not unconstitutionally vague. The evidence showed that defendant had numerous items, including appliances, pieces of wood, pipes, and other miscellaneous items, stored outside on his business property. The statute permitted outside storage of goods, materials and equipment only in certain districts, and defendant's property was not in one of those districts. The statute further delineated exceptions to its provisions and listed a number of situations where outside storage of goods, materials, and equipment was permitted. Therefore, the statute afforded an individual reasonable notice as to what was and was not prohibited.</SPAN></P>

The juvenile also contended that the trial court erroneously declined to suppress his confession and overruled his motion for a mistrial. The court affirmed the convictions, concluding that (1) the trial court conducted a meaningful review of the transcript, transfer report, and the transfer order, and heard each party's arguments before it determined that transfer requirements under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 6.1-269 were satisfied. (2) The juvenile was not in custody at the time of his initial admission of guilt and prior Miranda warnings were unnecessary. The juvenile's waiver and related confession were voluntary and properly admitted into evidence. (3) The motion for a mistrial was properly denied because the juvenile was not prejudiced by the prosecutor's comments during closing arguments.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol under &sect; 18.2-266 after having previously been convicted of a like offense. He objected to the use of his prior convictions as predicate offenses because they were uncounseled. The court reversed the judgment, ruling that because his first conviction was uncounseled, its admission was error under &sect; 46.2-943. A prior conviction was not constitutionally admitted in a subsequent trial when the prior conviction resulted in a prison sentence unless defendant had or waived counsel. Imprisonment included a sentence imposed and conditionally suspended. Additionally, when a fact that was judicially noticed was not a fact universally regarded as established by common notoriety, the judge's personal knowledge of it was irrelevant. The doctrine of judicial notice thus did not validate the trial judge's inference that defendant must have had counsel in his second prior trial in order to have entered into a plea agreement. Without the fact of which the trial judge took judicial notice, there was insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the second conviction was counseled, and it was not admissible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While issuing a traffic summons to the driver of an automobile in which defendant was a passenger, an officer saw a plastic bottle with foil on top partially protruding from defendant's pack. The bottle appeared to the officer to be a homemade &quot;bong.&quot; The officer seized the device and arrested defendant, who was later charged with possession of cocaine because of cocaine residue on the foil. On appeal of the trial court's granting of defendant's' motion to suppress, the court first noted that, contrary to defendant's argument, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-398 et seq., which permitted the Commonwealth to bring an interlocutory appeal, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The court then noted that the finding that the officer did not have the expertise to know if the burnt residue he observed on the foil was cocaine residue did not answer the question of whether it was apparent that the bottle could have been evidence of a crime. Because of the distinctive character of the item and the highly unlikely event that it had a legitimate use, the officer had probable cause to believe that the &quot;homemade bong&quot; partially protruding from defendant's pack was evidence of a crime.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the judge pro tempore's decision to transfer custody to appellee wife where the husband violated a court order by attempting to enroll his son in a boarding school and later left his older child alone for over a week. In the determination of spousal and child support, the husband's expenses were considered excessive and did not justify penalizing the wife with a reduced award. The husband's debts were adequately considered. The husband's brain lesion was considered, but was not felt to warrant a material effect on the award, and that conclusion did not appear plainly wrong.

The court held that defendant had shown a sufficient need for the expert testimony, and it was error to deny the appointment. Defendant was arrested for a &quot;peeping tom&quot; episode, and as a requirement of his probation, was required to continue therapy that he had started.

The court also held that former &sect; 18.2-60.3 was not unconstitutionally vague because the term &quot;emotional distress&quot; was a common and well-recognized legal term, which the courts of the commonwealth had judicially narrowed. The court compared the term to the use of the terminology in the civil cause of action for infliction of emotional distress. The court therefore found that the statute gave a reasonable person notice of what action was prohibited based on the definition of &quot;emotional distress&quot; and by requiring specific intent in conjunction with more than one overt act. The court also held that former &sect; 18.2-60.3 was not unconstitutionally overbroad because the statute was directed primarily at conduct that had no legitimate purpose rather than speech. The court noted that, if the statute was directed at speech, it was without regard to its content.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that (1) the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress the results of his blood test; (2) the commonwealth's noncompliance with the implied consent statute mandated suppression of the blood test evidence; and (3) the evidence was insufficient to sustain defendant's conviction of involuntary manslaughter. The dispatcher sent another trooper to the hospital to interview and obtain a blood test from defendant. Defendant was advised of his Miranda rights and of the Virginia implied consent law, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-268(b). Defendant took the blood test, which a physician administered. The trial court found that the blood test was without valid consent because defendant was not under arrest, and the test was administered more than two hours after the accident. However, the trial court found that the trooper did not unconstitutionally seize defendant because he had probable cause to arrest him. The trial court further found that exigent circumstances existed due to the dissipating nature of alcohol in blood. The court affirmed the judgment and found that defendant's alcohol blood reading was properly obtained pursuant to the exigent circumstances exception.</SPAN></P>

Thus, the court determined an insanity acquittee was entitled to release when that person had recovered sanity or was no longer dangerous. The court held that former &sect; 19-2-181(2) was unconstitutional because it improperly placed upon petitioner the burden of proving, even if she was not insane that she was not dangerous to the public peace and herself, which was contrary to judicial precedent.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that Fairfax City, Va., Ordinance No. 1987-11 (1987), under which two of defendant's predicate offenses occurred, was invalid because it was a prospective adoption of future legislative amendments. The commonwealth sought review, contending that the ordinance was enacted pursuant to the municipality's statutory grant of authority. On appeal, the court held that Fairfax City, Va., Ordinance No. 1987-11 (1987) was not unconstitutional because no improper delegation of authority actually occurred. The court held that the ordinance incorporated only those provisions of state law that had already been enacted and signed by the Governor prior to the date the ordinance was enacted.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of maiming and was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, with six years suspended and 15 years of unsupervised probation. The sentencing order required defendant to keep the peace and be of good behavior and remain on unsupervised probation for 15 years. The trial court revoked four years of defendant's six-year suspended sentence based on evidence that defendant had been convicted of injuring a correctional facility employee while in prison, in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-55, and that he had made threatening telephone calls from prison to his mentally deficient daughter and her mother. Defendant had also been cited for some behavioral problems while in prison. Defendant contended that the trial court lacked authority to revoke his sentence. The court found that under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-306, the trial court had authority to revoke defendant's sentence before the period of probation began. The court determined that defendant's conviction for injuring a correctional officer while his sentence was suspended violated the condition of suspension and justified the trial court in revoking defendant's sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court conducted a Batson analysis of the prosecutor's strikes. The court affirmed the conviction and stated that the trial judge presided at the proceedings; personally observed the entire jury panel, the challenged jurors and the composition of the trial jury; entertained the assurances and arguments of the prosecutor; and was familiar with the case. Obvious human characteristics such as age, sex, race, and demeanor were generally discernible and apparent to anyone present in the courtroom, including the trial judge, defendant, and his counsel. Though not precisely recited in the record, such facts and circumstances attendant to jury selection presented an array of sensory perceptions to the trial judge which were relevant and appropriate considerations to a disposition of defendant's motion. The prosecutor's attribution of his peremptory strikes to age, a permissible use of peremptory strikes, was easily subject to the scrutiny of the court as well as all assembled and unchallenged by defense counsel. The evidence supported the prosecutor's explanation and, more importantly, the factual findings and conclusions of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought to introduce evidence at trial of the victim's prior sexual conduct in order to explain the origin of a hair fragment found in her cervix. The hair fragment was not positively identified as defendant's, though it was found to be from a person of African-American descent. The victim admitted to having sexual intercourse with her boyfriend several days before the alleged crime. Both defendant and the victim's boyfriend were African-Americans and the doctor who examined the victim was prepared to testify that the hair could have come from the boyfriend. The trial court ruled that the evidence was inadmissible under the rape shield law, &sect; 18.2-67.7. In reversing defendant's conviction, the court ruled that the probative value of the victim's prior sexual conduct, especially because it tended to rebut the only significant physical evidence of defendant's guilt, outweighed any embarrassment to the victim or prejudice it might have caused in the minds of the jury. Defendant had the constitutional rights of compulsory process, confrontation, and due process to present the evidence, the court ruled, and the trial court committed reversible error in excluding it.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A state trooper activated the lights of his vehicle and stopped where defendant's pick-up truck was parked along a highway. Defendant admitted that he had been drinking and performed &quot;very poorly&quot; on field sobriety tests. The officer administered a breathalyzer test and arrested defendant for driving under the influence. The circuit court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the charge, which alleged that the trooper lacked the reasonable suspicion necessary to justify the initial stop. The circuit court found that the stop of defendant's truck, in the absence of reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, did not violate U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court determined that a reasonable person in defendant's position, based on the trooper's activation of his flashing lights, would have concluded that he had no choice but to comply with the trooper's show of authority by stopping his vehicle under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-817.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The primary question on appeal was whether the regulation of the Virginia Marine Resources Commission that required commercial fishermen to register and to report their harvests was a proper exercise of the Commonwealth's police power and its authority to manage its fisheries for the public good. The court held that it was. The Commonwealth's authority to regulate fishing had been long established. The goal of the legislation, to control the increasing pressure on the Commonwealth's fish stock, was legitimate and the means chosen by the legislature were reasonably related to that legitimate goal. While the fisherman raised many constitutional challenges to the regulation, those challenges were not well founded. The fisherman was engaged in a business that was subject to reasonable regulation by the Commonwealth and there was nothing in the regulatory scheme that supported the arguments against it.</SPAN></P>

Defendant alleged that a traffic stop for a safety inspection pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 52-8.4 was in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant alleged that the safety inspection stop by the state trooper was an unconstitutional vehicle roadblock. Upon stopping defendant, who was driving a commercial trash truck, the trooper discovered the status of defendant's license on a record check when he stated that he had misplaced his license. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Under the circumstances, the warrantless inspection of defendant's trash truck did not violate the Fourth Amendment and was conducted pursuant to &sect; 52-8.4, which mandated safety regulations for commercial vehicles pursuant to the United States Motor Carrier Act of 1984, 49 U.S.C.S. app. &sect; 2501. Under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 52-8.4, the State adopted the regulations at 49 C.F.R. &sect; 396.9(a), which allowed law enforcement officers to enter upon and perform inspections of motor carrier vehicles. The trooper properly conducted the inspection pursuant to a regulatory scheme that furthered the important government interest of regulating commercial vehicles. The trooper was properly trained to conduct the inspection, which was performed at a correct place and time, and was appropriate in scope and duration.</SPAN></P>

Upon execution of the warrant, the police found the tenant, defendant, and three other adults in the apartment. A search of defendant's rear pants pocket uncovered a bottle of cocaine. The court held that under the totality of the circumstances probable cause existed to search all of the persons found inside the apartment when the warrant was executed. A substantial nexus existed between the observation of cocaine in the apartment by the police, the private nature of the apartment, and the easily concealable contraband.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County (Virginia), which convicted him of driving while intoxicated and punished him as provided by Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court could not punish him as a second offender because his first DWI conviction was void in that it was under Fairfax County, Va., Code &sect; 82-4-17, which was invalid. In affirming the judgment below, the court held that defendant's challenge of his conviction for a first offense under &sect; 82-4-17 constituted an impermissible collateral attack in a prosecution for a second DWI offense under Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-266, 18.2-270. The court noted that it had previously invalidated portions of Fairfax County, Va., Code &sect; 82-4-17 and the penalty provision of Fairfax County, Va., Code &sect; 82-4-21. However, the court held that the penalty provision was invalid only to the extent of its enhanced provision for second offenders. The substantive provision of Fairfax County, Va., Code &sect; 82-4-17 and the first offender penalty provision of Fairfax County, Va., Code &sect; 82-4-21 remained valid. Because defendant was convicted under Fairfax County, Va., Code &sect; 82-4-17 and punished as a first offender under Fairfax County, Va., Code &sect; 82-4-21, he did not come within the purview of the portion of &sect; 82-4-21 that was previously declared invalid.</SPAN></P>

When he arrived, he observed a parked car and saw the driver leaning into the car, which had two other occupants in it. Defendant started to get out of the car but the officer ordered him to stay in the car. Later, defendant got completely out of the car, shoved a bluish bag underneath the car, and walked toward the officer. The officer patted defendant down and then called for back-up. After help arrived, the officer retrieved the bluish bag, which contained PCP. Defendant argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence discarded by him during an illegal seizure. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction. The court found that a reasonable person in light of the officer's request, repeated twice in a raised voice, would have concluded that he was not free to leave. The court noted that the officer admitted that he had no reason to suspect the car's occupants of any illegal activity. Thus, the court reasoned that the officer had no reason to suspect that anyone in the car would harm him.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his convictions by the Circuit Court for the County of Arlington (Virginia) for robbery and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. He argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the firearm conviction, that the initial show-up identification was unduly suggestive, and that the Victim Impact Statement showed the victim was biased against all blacks and that he was entitled to a new trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A jogger who held both hands in his pockets and pointed at her what looked to be a gun robbed the victim. She reported the robbery and gave a detailed description to the police. She identified defendant in a show-up identification, viewing him from across a street. On appeal, the court affirmed. There was sufficient evidence to support a firearm conviction under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-53.1 under the subjective totality of the circumstances. The victim saw an impression in defendant's pocket that she believed was a gun and gave her money to him because she believed that he had a gun even though she did not see a gun. The totality of the circumstances also supported the admission of the show-up identification because the victim accurately described defendant, the identification confrontation was shortly after the crime, and the victim was very certain of the identification. The Victim Impact Statement evidenced that the victim harbored a strong bias against Afro-Americans that developed after the attack. This was not after-discovered evidence that necessitated a new trial when defendant could have elicited testimony regarding the bias at the time of the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that the trial court made instructional errors and erred in admitting defendant's statements to a sheriff's deputy and that the evidence did not support the conviction. The court found that the trial judge did not commit reversible error by deleting the first three sentences of defendant's requested charge on the definition of the term &quot;threat.&quot; The first sentence of the proposed instruction properly defined the term, but the second and third sentences were potentially misleading. Likewise, the trial judge properly declined to instruct the jury that the Commonwealth was required to prove a &quot;true threat&quot; or a &quot;serious threat.&quot; The adjectives &quot;true&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; would have interjected an issue that was not supported by the evidence. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-83 only required proof of a &quot;threat.&quot; Even if the trial judge erred in not more fully explaining to the jury the definition of &quot;threat,&quot; the omission was not material. The instructions given to the jury correctly stated the law. Moreover, defendant's statement was admissible because it tended to prove his animosity toward the victim, and its probative value outweighed the prejudice that it may have engendered.</SPAN></P>

The Department sent a cease and desist order to the contractor.

On appeal, the court held that the order was a case decision under Va. Code &sect; 9-6.14:4(D) because it determined that the contractor violated a law. However, because Va. Code &sect; 54.1-111, which was the Department's sole mechanism for handling allegations of unlicensed activities, did not authorize a cease and desist order, the order was invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The owner's examination of his market's financial records disclosed $ 200 per day deficiencies in the ledger entries, which reflected a pattern of downward adjustments in the daily receipts with the exception of lottery proceeds. A police investigator confirmed the findings that the market suffered a total loss of $ 43,215. Defendant, the market's bookkeeper, admitted that she was adjusting the books to cover up not paying for lottery tickets. Defendant was convicted of felony embezzlement and sentenced to confinement for 15 years, 9 years of which were suspended on the condition that she made restitution of $ 43,000. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, finding that restitution was an appropriate component in defendant's sentence and not an unreasonable condition to the suspended sentence or an abuse of discretion. The amount of restitution was supported by the record and defendant submitted no alternative plans or evidence. The court, absent a miscarriage of justice, refused to consider the issue, not argued before the trial court, of whether restitution was an unconstitutional burden and improperly ordered to someone other than the victim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for embezzlement and the judgment ordering restitution as a condition of the suspended sentence.</SPAN></P>

The doctor argued that the board improperly applied the statute retroactively because his undergraduate and clinical training was completed prior to the enactment of Va.

The court affirmed the judgment, holding that the board properly applied the regulation and the statutory law, including the amending language, in effect at the time the doctor's application was completed. The court held that &sect; 54.1-2930(4) did not give the board discretion to waive the requirement that the clinical training be received in an approved hospital.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was declared a habitual offender. On appeal, he argued that his conviction for driving on a revoked license was based upon an invalid ordinance. He claimed that there was a variance between the penalty provisions of the Fairfax County, Va., Code &sect; 82-46.2-301 and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-266. Defendant argued that the lack of uniformity violated Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.1-522, which required that ordinances regulating the operation of motor vehicles be uniform with the general laws of the commonwealth. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that the severability provision of Fairfax County, Va., Code &sect; 1-1-11 was applicable, and Fairfax County, Va., Code &sect; 82-46.2-301 was not invalid in its entirety. The primary purpose of &sect; 82-46.2-301 was to provide for increased punishment for repeat offenders, and that purpose was served by the increased provision for jail time from 6 to 12 months. A severance of the lesser fine provision from &sect; 82-46.2-301 left the punishment provision for first offenders identical in the county and state laws.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the hearing officer correctly applied the clear and convincing evidence burden of proof and properly admitted evidence of prior abuse by the father. Additionally, the court held that the trial court applied the correct standard of review. Because the father failed to preserve the issue for review, the court rejected his argument that the commissioner lacked statutory authority to adopt the child protective services guidelines. The court determined that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 63.1-248.1 and the child protective services guidelines were not unconstitutionally vague.

The court found that the evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction under the abusive language statute. The court concluded that the abusive language was not spoken in the presence or hearing of the complainant. The distance that separated her from defendant established as a matter of law that the language was not spoken face-to-face, and the distance and the barriers between the complainant and defendant precluded an immediate violent response or retaliation by the complainant.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant employee sought review of a decision of the Industrial Commission (Virginia), which denied his claim for workers' compensation insurance benefits from appellees, his employer and its insurer. The employee asserted that the five-year limitation on occupational disease claims, as applied pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 65.1-52(3), denied his constitutional rights to Due Process and Equal Protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was exposed to silica fibers in 1975 while working for the employer. He was not diagnosed as having work-related silicosis until 1988. A year later, he filed the claim for benefits. A deputy commissioner held the Commission lacked jurisdiction because the employee failed to file his claim within five years of his last exposure as required by &sect; 65.1-52(3). The Commission affirmed the deputy's decision. On appeal, the court held that the time limitations under &sect; 65.1-52(3) were not violative of Due Process if the legislation had a reasonable relationship to a proper purpose and was not arbitrary or discriminatory. The court determined that the time limits under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 65.1-52 were not unreasonable or unrelated to the state's legitimate objective of providing finality to the rights and remedies created under the state workers' compensation statute. Thus, the court held, &sect; 65.1-52 did not violate Due Process under the rational basis test. The court further ruled that because all silicosis claimants were subject to the same limiting impediments, and such claimants were not a suspect class, the employee's Equal Protection challenge was also without merit.</SPAN></P>

The Commonwealth contended on appeal that the trial court erred in ruling that Fairfax, Va. County Code &sect; 82-4-21 was invalid. The court stated that defendant's three convictions, one being under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-266, would have been counted as two convictions under Fairfax, Va.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to suppress marijuana seized from his person and automobile by the arresting officer. Defendant argued that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-60 contained a statutory exclusionary rule that was not limited to constitutional violations, that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 19.2-83 imposed upon the police a burden of articulable suspicion necessary for investigatory detention greater than that required for a Terry stop, that the act of the police officer in pulling up behind his car and shining his bright lights and spotlight on him constituted a seizure of his person, and that the police officer's observations prior to confronting him did not provide a sufficient basis for an investigatory stop under &sect; 19.2-83. The court affirmed, holding that the arresting officer had probable cause to believe that defendant possessed marijuana, that &sect; 19.2-60 did not set forth rules or standards governing motions to suppress or command the suppression of evidence, and that &sect; 19.2-83 did not deny to the police the authority to discharge their proper and expected function of maintaining public order through surveillance and legitimate inquiry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After the board reprimanded the chiropractor, the chiropractor sought judicial review. The trial court affirmed the reprimand, and the chiropractor sought further review. On appeal, the chiropractor contended that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 54.1-2938, requiring chiropractors to use the word chiropractor with their name if they use the title doctor, and Va. Code Ann. &sect; 54.1-2914(A)(12), prohibiting the publication of a claim of superiority, were unconstitutional. The court held that the chiropractor's business card, which contained the word &quot;chiropractic&quot; in the name of the chiropractor's clinic only, did not comply with Va. Code Ann. &sect; 54.1-2938. The court held that &sect; 54.1-2938 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it had a reasonable relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. The court held that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 54.1-2914(A)(12) prohibited only untruthful claims of superiority and, therefore, was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. However, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court because the standardless application of &sect; 54.1-2914(A)(12) to the chiropractor violated his right to free speech.</SPAN></P>

In addition, it held that the trial court did not err, as also contended by the husband, in concluding that it could not set aside the judgment after the passage of 21 days from its entry. Unquestionably, the husband received such notice. He was served with process, made an appearance and had an opportunity to present his objections. The husband appeared and actively participated in the proceeding prior to the entry of a decree of divorce and, thereafter, on appeal. Notice to him was dispensed with only after he absented himself from the jurisdiction of the court without providing the clerk with his new address as required by statute. Since he was a pro se litigant, the husband was required to file with the clerk of the court a written statement of his place of residence and mailing address. Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-319(A). He was further required to inform the clerk in writing of any changes of residence and mailing address during the pendency of the action.

The court held that the contact was made freely and voluntarily and not in response to coercion. The court found no error in the trial court's refusal to suppress certain statements and physical evidence because defendant had waived his Miranda rights and had consented to a search of the vehicle he had been driving. The court held that the commonwealth had to prove that defendant possessed actual knowledge of the occurrence of the accident, and such knowledge of injury which would be attributed to a reasonable person under the circumstances of the case. The court concluded that the trial court erred by instructing the jury that the commonwealth had met its burden of showing knowledge by defendant of the occurrence of the accident by establishing either actual knowledge or such knowledge attributable to a reasonable person under the circumstances of the case, but that such error was harmless.

Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-422, which made it illegal for a person over the age of 16 to wear in public a mask, hood, or other device to cover the face, so as to conceal the identity of the wearer. The trial court held that the statute was not unconstitutional facially or as applied to defendant, a Ku Klux Klan member.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, the court tested the facial validity of the statute by examining whether it reached a substantial amount of protected activity and whether any chilling effect was real and substantial. The court rejected the broad interpretation that the law prohibited ski masks in cold weather, religious and secular veils, and similar face coverings, and held that the phrase &quot;so as to conceal the identity of the wearer&quot; expressed an element of intent, so that covering a face for other purposes was not a violation. The court held that the evidence permitted an inference by the trier of fact that defendant had the prerequisite intent. The court held that the statute did not violate the First Amendment as it applied to defendant because there was no showing that he intended the mask to send a particularized message that was likely to be understood. The court found that the record did not support the argument that the mask added anything, other than fear and intimidation, to the symbolism of the hood and robes of the Klan. The court held that the legitimate interest in the prevention of violence and crime by the unmasking of potential criminals outweighed any minor impact on Klansmen.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that the arresting officer violated his Fourth Amendment rights when he approached defendant's stopped car, seized a cut-off straw from between the driver's legs, and then searched the trunk.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While defendant's car, in which he was a passenger, was stopped at a toll booth, the arresting officer peered into defendant's car and observed a small straw on the seat between the driver's legs. From his drug enforcement experience, the officer recognized the straw as the type used to snort cocaine, and he reached in and retrieved the straw. After noticing white powder on it, the officer ordered the driver to pull over, where the officer searched the trunk and discovered quantities of marijuana and cocaine. Defendant was tried and convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, as well as possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's convictions. The court held that the officer did not violate defendant's Fourth Amendment rights because he had a right to walk up to defendant's car, which was stopped in a public place. Moreover, he satisfied the requirements of the plain view doctrine in seizing the straw, and his subsequent discovery of white powder residue on the straw gave the officer probable cause to search the trunk of the car.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Fairfax County (Virginia), which convicted him of attempting to extort money or pecuniary benefit in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-59. On appeal, he contended that the trial court erred in denying his motion to set aside the jury verdict and to dismiss the indictment against him on the ground that &sect; 18.2-59 was unconstitutional, either on its face or as applied to him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's wife was employed at the county office for children. Her supervisor disclosed to the wife that she, the supervisor, had engaged in a sadomasochistic sexual relationship with her husband. After the wife's employment was terminated, she appealed her dismissal, and defendant assisted her. He wrote to the assistant county attorney and threatened to distribute a flyer about the supervisor's behavior at the county fair and to release the information to newspapers unless the county apologized to his wife and paid her claimed expenses. The jury found him guilty of extortion. On appeal, defendant contended that the words &quot;threat,&quot; &quot;character,&quot; &quot;pecuniary benefit,&quot; and &quot;extort&quot; were not defined in &sect; 18.2-59 and were unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed and affirmed. The words were ordinary, everyday words and had been in the Virginia Code virtually unchanged since 1849. The court also rejected defendant's claim that &sect; 18.2-59 was unconstitutional as to him in that it was overbroad and impinged upon his First Amendment right to free speech. Section 18.2-59 did not limit or punish speech. It proscribed only the act of employing speech for extortionate purposes.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was also convicted of the use of a firearm in the commission of murder in violation of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-53.1. Defendant sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court improperly permitted amendment of the indictment. Defendant also claimed that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-154 was unconstitutionally vague, and that the evidence was insufficient. The court rejected these claims and affirmed the convictions. The court upheld the amendment of the indictment because the character and nature of the offense were not changed and defendant was informed two months before trial that the Commonwealth intended to prosecute under &sect; 18.2-154. The court held that &sect;18.2-154 was not unconstitutionally vague. The court found that the legislature intended that the statute incorporate by reference the degrees of murder in Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-32. The court also found that even if Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-154 failed to define the necessary aggravating factors to elevate an offense to first degree murder, the challenged portion was severable from the rest of the law. Because defendant was not convicted under the challenged portion of &sect; 18.2-154, he was unaffected by its alleged vagueness. The court also held that the separate convictions of murder and use of a firearm did not constitute double jeopardy and that the evidence was sufficient.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-183's evidentiary presumption of fraudulent intent, was unconstitutionally applied to her because she never received written notice from the payee of the check.</SPAN></P>

The store notified her by telephone 10 days later, and mailed an envelope to her that was not claimed after several notices over three weeks. At trial, she moved to strike the evidence as insufficient and moved to set aside the conviction. On review, the court found that she could raise the issue of sufficiency of the evidence because those motions preserved the entire record, that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-181 did not require a showing of present consideration of goods or services given in exchange for a check, and that a 1978 amendment to &sect; 18.2-181 did not make giving a bad check as payment for past debts a larceny. The court found that conviction under &sect; 18.2-181 required proof of the fraudulent intent of the drawer of the check as an element of the crime, that the record did not show that defendant had such intent to defraud, and that the presumption found in Va.

Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Because the city had also enacted an ordinance proscribing abusive language, which had been limited by the Supreme Court of Virginia to prohibit only fighting words, the court found that Virginia Beach, Va., City Code &sect; 23-22 was meant to have a broader sweep than fighting words and was therefore unconstitutional. The court found that viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the city, there was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction of improper driving and using abusive language. The court held that Virginia Beach, Va., City Code &sect; 23-12 was constitutional because prosecution thereunder was limited to words that had a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark was addressed. The court declined to adopt a higher standard of restraint for law enforcement officials than for citizens.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was twice convicted in Virginia and once in Maryland of driving on a suspended or revoked operator's license. The Department of Motor Vehicles certified to the Commonwealth's attorney that defendant's driving record brought him within the purview of the Act. Defendant's driving record made no reference to any alcohol related offenses. Defendant contended that the provisions of the Act that authorized trial courts to refuse entry of an habitual offender order, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.1-387.3, created an unreasonable classification in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of equal protection of laws because they only applied to individuals convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants or other drugs and did not apply to individuals convicted of driving on suspended or revoked operator's licenses. The court disagreed, holding that there was a reasonable basis for the classification because it distinguished between a class of people who had suffered from the debilitative diseases of alcohol or drug addiction, but who had been cured, and a class of people who had violated the laws of the Commonwealth for no apparent reason.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's finding of abduction, despite the fact that one defendant was the children's mother. The court found that neither defendant was entitled to custody of the children and that the custodial parent had entrusted the care of the children to their grandparents. The court held that the commonwealth's evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's finding that defendants had acted with the intent required under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-47.

The court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded. The court held that the employee introduced sufficient credible evidence to establish that his hearing loss was caused by his employment and not by factors outside his employment. Because the issue of whether his hearing loss was caused by conditions peculiar to mine work was not litigated in his first case, collateral estoppel based on issue preclusion did not preclude the award of benefits for the earlier loss. However, because the employer obtained a vested right in the final judgment from the first case through the application of the law in effect at the time of the former decision that the claim was noncompensable, the employee's recovery was limited to his loss suffered after the first claim.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's vehicle was stopped at a roadblock that state troopers had set up to inspect drivers' licenses and to check for equipment violations.

At trial he learned that the troopers had not been directed to establish the checkpoint and asserted that the stop was impermissible. The trial court overruled his motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the stop and convicted him. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant's objection to the blood alcohol content was timely. The stop at the roadblock was reasonable because the troopers had no unconstrained or unbridled discretion in stopping motorists. The checking detail was conducted during daylight, every vehicle was stopped, and motorists were detained briefly. The checkpoint was marked by warnings and police vehicles, and uniformed officers were present to indicate governmental authority. It was of no consequence that the officers were not specifically directed to establish the checkpoint at that place and time. The stopping of all vehicles at a fixed checkpoint advanced the state's interest in protecting the public from unsafe drivers and vehicles.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court of Madison County (Virginia), which convicted defendant, upon jury verdict, of seven counts of violations of former Va. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18.2-370 and 18.2-374.1. Defendant raised numerous contentions, including a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence regarding defendant's conviction on three of the seven counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of seven counts of violating former Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-370 (1979), and Va. Code Ann. &sect;18.2-374.1 (1983) for allegedly taking pictures of several minor children in various stages of undress. Defendant was charged in a nine count indictment; the Commonwealth declined to prosecute two of the nine counts. On appeal, defendant raised numerous allegations of error, including a claim that the trial court erred in refusing to quash the indictment and in denying defendant's motion to sever four of the counts from the remaining three for separate trials. The court found that while the indictment joined the seven counts improperly, the error was harmless. Former Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-374.1 was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Finally, the evidence was insufficient to sustain defendant's convictions on counts six, seven, and nine of the indictment, but was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction in count eight. As such, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment in part and reversed its judgment in part.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the statute applied although there was no injurious exposure after the effective date of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee was a coal miner worker who was exposed to noise prior to the effective date of &sect; 65.1-46.1, which made ordinary diseases of life compensable for workers in certain circumstances. The employee was not diagnosed with work-related hearing loss until after the effective date. On appeal, the court held that under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 65.1-49, an occupational disease was not compensable until a diagnosis of such was communicated to the employee. The court found that the jurisdictional statute of limitations did not bar the claim. The court held that the employer's liability did not commence until the time of such communication, so the application of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 65.1-46.1 to these facts was not unconstitutionally retroactive because it did not interfere with any vested rights or liabilities. The court noted that the commission could use the employee's history and the absence of non-work-related factors, genetic factors, or biological factors to infer that the hearing loss was work-related. The court accepted the commission's findings of fact on causation as conclusive and binding because there was evidence to support them.</SPAN></P>

The ordinance may have forced people to curb their freedom of expression and association or risk arrest. The court decided that the statute was unconstitutionally vague.

The court further held that the trial court acted properly in refusing to allow defendant himself, a lay witness, to testify as to the conformity of the county ordinance. The court also held that even if one of defendant's three convictions had been for driving under the influence the trial court would have been powerless under Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On appeal, defendant contended that holding the trial inside the correctional facility deprived him of his right to a public trial. The court reasoned that this contention raised the question of whether he was denied his constitutional right to a public trial. The court held that a public trial was a trial which was not limited or restricted to any particular class of the community, but was open to the free observation of all. The court found nothing in the record to indicate that defendant did not receive a public trial. The record contained little information concerning the surroundings of the courtroom procedures followed. However, an apparently bona fide courtroom was located within the confines of the correctional center. The court reasoned that the trial judge specifically ordered that no shakedowns or sign-in requirements were to have been conducted for anyone attending the trial. The court concluded that the record contained no evidence of such factors that would tend to dissuade the public from attending. The court held that the trial court did not err in allowing the Commonwealth to inquire as to whether defendant's witnesses had previously been convicted of any felonies.</SPAN></P>

Prior to trial, upon the motion of defendant's attorney, the trial court entered an order directing that a psychological evaluation of defendant to determine his capacity to stand trial, and his mental state at the time of the alleged crime. A psychological exam was conducted, however, defense counsel made a motion, which was denied by the trial court, for a second psychological evaluation on the morning of the trial. The court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant defendant's motion for a second psychological evaluation. Defendant also contended that he was denied due process of law by the trial court's failure to appoint a psychiatrist to conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluating, preparing, and presenting his defense. The court noted that although the U.S. Supreme Court had delineated a new standard for psychiatric assistance in Ake v. Oklahoma, 105 S.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The mother testified that she had sexual intercourse only with the father during the two years immediately preceding the child's birth. In addition, a medical expert testified that genetic blood grouping test results indicated that the paternity of the father was extremely likely, being about 99.47 percent. The court affirmed and held as follows: (1) Va. Code Ann. &sect; 20-61.1, which allowed the trial court to enforce a judgment for the support of an illegitimate child, was applicable to both criminal and civil proceedings; (2) the evidence was sufficient to establish paternity because the results of a genetic blood grouping test and evidence of a putative father's access to the mother during the period of conception were sufficient to support a finding of paternity; (3) the genetic blood grouping test did not violate the father's privilege against self-incrimination because the privilege only protected an individual from being compelled to provide evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature against himself; and (4) the withdrawal of blood was not a compulsion of this nature.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs, rival cement company and neighboring landowner, moved for a temporary injunction to prevent the sale; intervenor moved to intervene. Plaintiffs argued the transaction was an ultra vires act and defendant's actions in selling the land were arbitrary and capricious. The court held the proposed enterprise was new to the Commonwealth and defendant had the power under the Industrial Development and Revenue Bond Act (Act), Va. Code Ann. &sect; 15.2-4901 et seq., to take actions to induce the business in question to bring to fruition the proposed facility. Thus, the court could not second guess those decisions and actions. The court found the requirements for the issuance of a temporary injunction were not satisfied since plaintiffs did not establish proof of damage particular to them of an irreparable character.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did a thorough analysis of constitutional law and the right to privacy, and held that the United States Constitution did not confer a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy, and that the Virginia sodomy statute did not infringe upon any fundamental right because it criminalized all acts of sodomy, both heterosexual and homosexual.

Defendant brought a motion to dismiss the action on the ground that the statutes involved were unconstitutionally vague. The court overruled defendant's motion and scheduled the matter for trial. Defendant contended there were no standards other than the police officer's subjective views of whether an exhaust was comparable to factory equipment or whether it was producing noise that was in excess of that permitted by standard factory equipment. The court held that anti-noise statutes were not required to provide for scientific precision to pass constitutional muster. The court found it would be easier for motorcycle users if the legislature required all helmets to have labels indicating compliance with the standards stated in &sect; 46.2-910, but held that the failure to require such labels did not render the statute unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant further contended that the statute was overbroad, infringed upon his right of privacy, and imposed unreasonably harsh punishment upon him for the exercise of his individual sexuality. The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss. The court found that defendant's arguments mirrored the arguments of the losing party in Bowers v. Hardwick, in which the Supreme Court of the United States found the Georgia Anti-Sodomy Statute to be constitutional. The court found that the Virginia Anti-Sodomy Statute was substantially the same as the Virginia Anti-Sodomy Statute.

Respondent filed a demurrer to the petition for termination of spousal support. The court sustained respondent's demurrer, holding that because the contract was incorporated into the final decree it was alimony. Therefore, the alimony was subject to the statutory provisions applicable at the time that the contract was effective. Because &sect; 20-109 was not amended until after the parties contracted for spousal support, application &sect; 20-109 would have been an unconstitutional impairment of the parties' contract.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution filed a motion requesting that the testimony given by a witness during the preliminary hearing in the capital murder case be admitted at trial. The witness died after the preliminary hearing, and defendant objected to the introduction of the prior testimony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prosecution moved to admit as evidence in defendant's capital murder trial the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who died after the preliminary hearing. The court granted the motion. The court found that the fact that there was no formal record of the preliminary hearing proceedings would not, in and of itself, operate to exclude the testimony of the deceased witness on the ground that it was at variance with the hearsay exception requirement. Under the Shifflett rule, the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness who was absent from the subsequent trial because of death could be proved by the oral testimony of a person who was present at the former trial and heard the witness testify. During the hearing on the motion, defendant stipulated to the elements required by the Shifflett rule: the witness was dead; the testimony of the witness was given under oath; the transcript of the deceased's testimony was accurate; and defendant was present during the testimony, with counsel, and was afforded the opportunity for cross-examination. Capital murder cases did not require the application of different rules of evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the prosecution's motion requesting that the preliminary hearing testimony of a witness be admitted at trial where the witness had died. Defendant had had the opportunity for due cross-examination of the witness, and all requirements for the admission of the prior sworn testimony as an exception to the hearsay rule had been satisfied as required by constitutional guarantees of cross-examination and confrontation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff appealed the General District Court of the City of Charlottesville (Virginia) order that granted defendant's claim to use her homestead exemption to exempt wages owed by her former employer from collection by plaintiff. Plaintiff alleged that defendant contractually waived the right to claim her homestead exemption if she defaulted on her loan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff sought to collect some wages from defendant's prior employer in order to credit the funds toward a car loan which defendant defaulted on. The court affirmed the finding that the exemption of the wages was preserved. The court found no caselaw holding Va. Code Ann. &sect; 34-22&nbsp;unconstitutional and presumed that the waiver was validly executed and enforceable under state law. The court found federal regulations limited application of &sect; 34-22, permitting a waiver of exemption to apply solely to the property that secured the debt. As the wages were not property securing the debt, the wages could not be subject to a security interest and the exemption could be applied. The court awarded attorney fees to plaintiff. The loan agreement permitted plaintiff to recover reasonable collection costs. The court found plaintiff's request excessive because plaintiff had just recently litigated this issue to another court and cited no intervening authority that would cast doubt on that decision. The court awarded an amount that it found in its discretion was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The general district court's decision that found defendant's homestead exemption was preserved through preemption was affirmed. The court awarded costs and attorney fees to plaintiff because the contract allowed for recovery of collection costs, but the court allowed less than plaintiff asked for because the amount requested was not reasonable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of disturbing the peace under Fairfax, Va., County Code &sect; 5-1-15. Defendant appealed for a trial de novo under Va. Code Ann. &sect; 16.1-132. Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the charge and contended that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court held that, in assessing the constitutionality of a statute, it was required to presume that the legislative action was valid and that it was required to construe the statute in accordance with the plain and unambiguous meaning of the language. The court found that the overbreadth test was whether the ambit of the challenged enactment was so broad as to significantly endanger constitutionally-protected speech. The court held that, under the First Amendment, enactments limiting &quot;abusive&quot; speech were constitutional only insofar as they proscribed fighting words or words which had a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom the remark was addressed. The court determined that the ordinance was not limited to fighting words and was abridging freedom of speech rights.

The court held that under the issues framed by the pleadings, there were no factual issues for determination. The court held further that the statutory provisions of &sect; 15.2-2650 of the Code of Virginia for a judicial determination and the validity of bonds set forth a procedure wherein citizens could be joined as a party to the proceedings by filing an answer, and there was no legal requirement to appoint counsel for the citizens of the jurisdiction, or citizens not sui juris, seeking a judicial determination.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a prior lawsuit, the court affirmed a decision of the board of zoning appeals denied the applicant's request for a permit to replace the fence on the front property line of his property. In this action, the court dismissed the motion for declaratory judgment finding that the applicant's rights as to the construction of the wall were governed by the 1997 amendments to the ordinance in question, rather than the 1995 ordinance that the applicant challenged. The court noted that the applicant had never applied for a permit under the 1997 amendments, which were changed to permit construction of fences in a front yard. The court held that the applicant did not acquire a vested right in his property for the construction of a wall under the 1995 ordinance because he failed to identify a significant official governmental act that would have authorized him to construct the wall that otherwise was not allowed. Further, the court concluded that the applicant failed to exhaust his administrative remedy to seek relief under the 1997 amendments, and therefore he was precluded from attacking the constitutionality of the ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The seller argued that it was error for the court to reject the original verdicts and that, in any event, the jury award in favor of the purchaser for the full purchase price of the motor vehicle was not based on the evidence. The court accepted the verdict in part and set it aside in part. The court found that a jury could amend its verdict at any time before it was discharged. As such, it found that it was proper to send the jury sent back to the jury room for further deliberations where the jurors could find a verdict they deemed proper untrammelled by the presence or influence of others. The court confirmed that there was testimony to support the jury's finding that the motor vehicle was worth substantially less than had been represented by the seller.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner driver appealed a determination by the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) that he was a habitual offender. The driver requested the court to find that one of the three driving while intoxicated (DWI) convictions upon which the determination was based was an invalid conviction because it was based on an invalid ordinance and, therefore, was not applicable to a habitual offender determination.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The DMV issued an order of revocation after it determined that the driver was a habitual offender based on three requisite traffic convictions within 10 years. One of the convictions was for a violation of a local ordinance. The court agreed with the driver that the ordinance was invalid at the time that the driver committed the offense leading to his conviction. The ordinance's readoption by the board of county supervisors constituted an improper attempt to make an incorporated amendment to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 18.2-266 effective locally before it was to become effective statewide. The action by the supervisors exceeded the board's statutorily granted power, rendering the readoption of the ordinance void under the Dillon Rule. The conviction in question was based on an invalid ordinance. The driver's DWI conviction pursuant to the ordinance was invalid and could not have been counted as a predicate offender determination pursuant to Va. Code Ann. &sect; 46.2-351. Accordingly, the court found that the driver, having had only two valid DWI convictions, was not by definition a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-229(A)(2)(a) until he reached the age of majority in 1982. The court also found that the son had knowledge of the fact and cause of his injuries on or before 1988 because he sought help for psychological problems from a counselor. The court further determined that the son's right to bring a cause of action lapsed in 1990. The court noted that retroactive application of Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-249(6) would violate the father's due process rights.</SPAN></P>

The court entered judgment in favor of the Commonwealth, fined the telemarketer, entered judgment on the bond, and enjoined future violations by the telemarketer of the Virginia Solicitation of Contributions Law, and the Virginia Consumer Protection Act. The court held that the evidence showed a pattern and practice of violations of both the Solicitation law and the Consumer Protections Act. The court held that notwithstanding signed contracts under which the telemarketer's employees were called &quot;independent contractors,&quot; in actual fact, the telemarketer had the right to exercise, and did exercise, control over the details of their work. Thus, the court held that the telemarketer was liable for its employees' wrongful acts committed within the scope of their employment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In plaintiff former employee's second amended motion for judgment, plaintiff sought compensatory damages, unspecified punitive damages, and legal costs as a result of the alleged inadequate handling by defendants, a supervisor, school board officials, and a city, of a complaint against him. Defendants filed a demurrer and the employee responded.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee alleged that his supervisor failed to properly handle a complaint against him and allowed the complaint to be leaked. He also alleged that the officials failed to intervene. The court sustained defendants' demurrers to the complaint. There was no violation of the Virginia Privacy Protection Act of 1976, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 2.1-377 et seq., because the Act did not provide for monetary damages, but only for injunctive relief. The employee had no claim for defamation because the supervisor's paraphrasing of the complaint did not tend to violence and breach of peace as required by Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-45. The employee's due process claims were denied because under the state constitution, absent a statute waiving immunity, the school board had immunity. Further, the Virginia Torts Claim Act, Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-195.1, removed school boards from its purview, and the only damages claims allowed for due process violations were confined to redress for takings of property. If the employee's claim was made under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, the officials' negligence was not a sufficient basis for unconstitutional conduct under &sect; 1983 insofar as the action involved a due process violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Since 1987, the Commonwealth's budgets had included money for pre-release and post-incarceration services. The distribution of such funds under the control of the Department. The corporation received grants under the Department's authorization each year to conduct the programs. The Governor used his veto to remove the language that authorized the Department to award grants to the corporation, but left the allowed money to the Department for the purpose of pre-release and post-incarceration services. The corporation maintained that the Governor was only permitted to veto an item or items for an appropriation, not a part or portion of an item. Defendants maintained the corporation had no standing to challenge the proposed statute. Its right to grant monies was tenuous and uncertain. With or without the provision in the statute, the corporation had not direct right to the money. The provision in the previous Commonwealth budgets had been directory, and not mandatory. There was no case or controversy.</SPAN></P>

The employee filed a motion for judgment. The employer demurred to the motion for judgment on the ground that the employee's exclusive remedy was provided by statute,&nbsp;Va.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The employee worked as a safety manager at one of the employer's facilities. The employee brought an action claiming that he was discharged on June 7, 1994, in retaliation for his complaining to his superiors that the employer was violating the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry safety regulations and that therefore, his discharge violated the public policy of Virginia. The employee filed a motion for judgment, to which the employer filed a demurrer. The court dismissed the motion for judgment and sustained the employer's demurrer. The court determined that Va. Code Ann. &sect; 40.1-51.2:2 was applicable and that it provided a remedy for the employee because he believed that he had been discriminated against because he filed a safety or health complaint. The court found that because &sect; 40.1-51.2:2 created a right and provided a remedy for the vindication of that right, then that remedy was exclusive. The court held that the one-year statute of limitations governed the employee's action and that because the time had run, the action was time barred.</SPAN></P>

The accident victim claimed that the Virginia Additur Statute,&nbsp;Va. Code Ann. &sect; 8.01-383.1 violated Va. Const. art. I, &sect;11. The court denied the accident victim's motion for reconsideration. The court determined that additur, with the consent of defendant, did not deprive plaintiff of her right to a jury trial. The court explained that it had to presume the constitutionality of the acts of the general assembly in the absence of clear indication to the contrary. The court concluded that the accident victim failed to demonstrate that the additur statute violated the constitution.</SPAN></P>
