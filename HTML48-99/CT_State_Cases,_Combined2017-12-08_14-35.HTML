The trial court denied the motions. The trial court convicted defendant of robbery in the first degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-133(4). On review, the court affirmed. The court found the record was sufficient to permit the review of defendant's unpreserved claim in regard to the trial court's failure to define the term &quot;firearm&quot; as set forth in &sect; 53a-3(19). The court held that the trial court properly charged the jury as to the crime of robbery in the first degree under &sect; 53a-3(19) where the existence of an actual firearm was not an essential element of robbery in the first degree.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued, among other contentions, that certain evidence should have been suppressed and that there was insufficient evidence to support the convictions. The court reversed because the search of defendant's pockets was unconstitutional but remanded because the evidence supporting the convictions was otherwise sufficient. The court reviewed the existence of probable cause to arrest defendant for the robbery only as of the time of the arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia because it was the search of defendant's pockets that led to the initial arrest for possession of drug paraphernalia. Viewed in their totality, the facts did not support a finding that there was probable cause to arrest defendant for either possession of narcotics paraphernalia or the burglary. The strength of the evidence acquired from the pockets and from the process of the subsequent arrest was such that the court could not conclude that it did not contribute to the conviction. Nevertheless, defendant was not entitled to an acquittal because there was sufficient evidence to support the convictions even without reliance on the evidence that should have been suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff client brought an action for legal malpractice against defendant attorney in the Superior Court in the judicial district of Tolland (Connecticut), alleging negligent drafting of a modification to a divorce decree and failure to warn of its legal consequences. The trial court granted the attorney's motion for summary judgment based on the three-year limitations period of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-577, and the client appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The client brought suit seven years after the attorney's last representation of her, but within three years of the date on which he last discussed the issue with her. The client contended on appeal that the attorney's continuing course of conduct tolled limitations, and that &sect; 52-577 was unconstitutional. The court stated that there was no tolling of statutes of limitations for the failure of an attorney to tell a client that a document drafted by the attorney could be inaccurate, and that the doctrine of continuing course of conduct was better suited to claims where the situation kept evolving after the act complained of was complete, such as medical malpractice, rather than one where the situation could not change, such as legal malpractice arising from negligent drafting. The court concluded that when the state constitution was adopted, there was a common law right to sue for legal malpractice and a six-year statutory limitation on the assertion of the right, but determined that the legislature had not tampered with the cause of action but merely amended the procedural aspect of enforcing the right, and that &sect; 52-577 as applied to the client was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court granting summary judgment to the attorney.</SPAN></P>

Defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. Substitute information had charged defendant and a co-defendant with the crimes of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder, and carrying a pistol without a permit. A jury convicted them of the lesser-included offense of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm. The court found no error in the rulings of the trial court with respect to severance, jury instructions, and the evidentiary rulings. However, based on the plain error doctrine, the court sua sponte raised the issue whether manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm was a lesser-included offense of murder. The court held that it was not and reversed the judgment and remanded the case for entry of judgment of conviction of manslaughter in the first degree.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that the award in this case was a reasonable estimate of the amount of damages that plaintiffs would recover if they prevailed at trial. Accordingly, the court rejected defendant's claims that his right to due process had been violated. The court also held that the statute of limitations afforded victims of child molestation an increased time period within which to file an action was rationally related to a legitimate state interest and was sufficiently based on reasons related to the accomplishment of that goal to withstand constitutional scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant and an accomplice approached the victim, who was pumping gas at a service station, told him that they had a gun, and took $ 260 from him. Within twenty minutes of the robbery police had apprehended defendant and the victim made a positive identification. Although the show-up identification was suggestive because defendant was the only suspect, the court found that it was necessary so that the victim could identify his assailants while his memory was still fresh. Considering the victim's opportunity to view defendant, the lighting, timeframe, and the victim's voice recognition of defendant, the court found that the identification was reliable. Although the trial judge made an inappropriate comment about machine gun fire in front of the jury, the court determined that the proceedings were not tainted. The court found that the trial court properly refused to accept evidence about clothes defendant was wearing when he entered the jail because there was no basis to believe that he was wearing the same cloths on the previous day.

Plaintiff brought suit against both drivers but settled with the driver of the car in which she was riding. The trial court found that defendants, the driver and the owner of the car that struck plaintiff, were negligent and awarded money damages in favor of plaintiff.

The court held that defendants did not meet their burden of proving that the statute was unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt and upheld the statute as constitutional. Defendants also contended that the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest under the offer of judgment statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a. The court agreed because it found that plaintiff was not entitled to interest because the judgment did not meet the requirements of &sect; 52-192a. The court reversed the judgment in part and remanded the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment in part and remanded the case with direction to render a judgment without any prejudgment interest because it found that the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest.

The court affirmed, finding that the challenged conduct of the prosecution either was not improper or, if inappropriate, did not so infect the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. The court reached the same conclusion after considering the instances of alleged impropriety cumulatively. In the context of the lengthy trial, the aggregate effect of the State's misconduct could not be said to have undermined the fairness of or have affected the outcome of the trial. Because the jury was in a position to weigh the probative value of the testimony without abandoning common sense and sacrificing independent judgment, the court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the expert testimony of the State into evidence.

Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-60. Defendant claimed that he was denied a fair trial and argued that the State's use of two peremptory challenges during voir dire violated his right to equal protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although defendant was shackled during his trial, the court found that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering the security measures and causing defendant to be restrained because defendant had a history of violent behavior and had directed this behavior toward the court and sheriffs. The trial court attempted to conceal the restraints from the sight of the jury. Defendant asserted that the second and 38th veniremember were dismissed such that equal protection was violated. Defendant did not object until the peremptory dismissal of the 38th veniremember. The trial court found that the State had a valid reason for challenging this veniremember and ruled that defendant's objection to the second veniremember was not timely. The court recognized that purposeful discrimination which would form the basis of a Batson challenge might not become apparent until several veniremembers had been questioned and a pattern emerged, therefore, the court found that defendant could preserve his right to a Batson hearing by alerting the trial court and the state when a member of a cognizable group was challenged.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mortgagor and another individual executed a mortgage deed to a bank on property they owned. They defaulted on their obligations to make payments on the promissory note that was secured by the mortgage. The bank commenced a foreclosure action but was declared insolvent. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the mortgagee, was appointed receiver and conveyed the bank's assets to a bridge bank, which pursued the foreclosure. It demanded that the mortgagor and other defendants disclose any defenses, which they did not do. Various delays occurred in the proceedings. The FDIC eventually moved for a judgment of strict foreclosure. No defendant opposed the motion or raised any defenses. Judgment of foreclosure was entered and the FDIC's motion for a deficiency judgment was granted. The mortgagor appealed the deficiency judgment. The court ruled that a deficiency hearing was part of an equitable proceeding and, as such, did not entitle the mortgagor to a jury trial. It was not an independent action on a debt. Many of the delays in the proceedings resulted from defendants' conduct but many were unavoidable. The mortgagor did not raise the defense of laches until his appeal.</SPAN></P>

V and XIV. The trial court affirmed, but the court reversed. The trial court's failure to adhere to the Child Support and Arrearage Guidelines because of the child's receipt of AFDC benefits was an abuse of discretion. The guidelines expressly provided that public assistance grants were not to be included in the calculation of child support. The father's due process and equal protection rights were not violated by requiring him to pay more than his child's pro rata share of AFDC benefits because the AFDC program had been amended to require that a family applying for benefits include a child who was receiving support payments. The court declined to address the argument that the father was denied his rights under Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 20.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the issue was not preserved below for appellate review; thus, for review, the issue had to meet four case-law criteria one of which was that the alleged constitutional violation clearly exist and clearly deprive defendant of a fair trial. Per the court, the trial court's instructions in toto properly included the subjective and objective aspects of the law on self-defense, and, ergo, the third criterion for review was not met as the alleged violation did not clearly exist. On a separate issue, the court rejected the claim that defendant's prior convictions for larceny and conspiracy to commit robbery and assault should not have been admitted as impeachment evidence albeit at least one prior conviction was more than 10-years old, and Connecticut courts usually followed Fed.

The court held that defendant was entitled to object to racially based exclusions of jurors through peremptory challenges, even though he and the rejected juror were not of the same race. However, the juror's negative encounters with police constituted a neutral ground that rebutted the inference of discrimination. Moreover, the State reconsidered the challenge and would have changed its course of conduct, but the rejected juror was no longer available. Defendant was properly denied access to police internal affairs files because he failed to show that the files might have contained any material relevant to the case or useful for impeachment purposes. The State's line of questioning regarding fingerprint cards did not warrant a mistrial because a curative instruction was given and there the one card admitted into evidence was relevant to the issue of identity. The &quot;hesitate to act&quot; formulation used in a jury instruction as to the definition of proof beyond a reasonable doubt did not violate defendant's right to due process of law because it did not decrease the state's burden.</SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged his conviction for causing risk of injury to a child on grounds the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed and affirmed the conviction. The court held that the creation of a prohibited situation was sufficient to trigger criminal liability. Even if the statute failed to provide definite notice as to the prohibited conduct, fair warning or other notice that such acts were prohibited would serve to surmount a vagueness challenge.

The court affirmed and held that the witness did not testify that she had never lied and the defense had ample cross-examination as to her truthfulness. The court further held that defendant did not properly preserve for review his claim that the trial court improperly precluded him from presenting evidence of the witness' bias because he failed to take an exception at trial.

The court found that the trial court correctly relied on the established standard governing the bias and recusal of administrative hearing officers when it found that the appearance of bias displayed by the commissioner did not so taint the process as to render it unconstitutional.

The court noted that although the gun was obtained in violation of defendant's constitutional rights, the State demonstrated that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The court also noted that a jury could reasonably have concluded that defendant was guilty of robbery in the second degree. The court noted that consciousness of guilt instructions, which permitted, but did not mandate, an inference of a guilty conscience, were evidentiary rather than constitutional in nature.

Defendant filed a motion to suppress the out of court identification, which the trial court denied. Defendant was convicted and appealed. The court held that the photographic array compiled by officers was neither unduly suggestive nor did it violate his right to due process. The court held that because all photographs in the array were obtained from the same source, and arranged such that all photographs were visible at one time, the array provided for a fair identification. In affirming the conviction, the court held that defendant failed to meet his burden to demonstrate that the identification resulted from the use of a procedure that violated his rights under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The lienholder, who also sought damages from the car repair facility, appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut) in favor of defendants.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lienholder was the first lienholder of record on an automobile that was involved in an accident and towed to the car repair and storage facility at the request of the police. The car was estimated to have a value of $ 300 after the accident and, after the owner abandoned it, it was repaired and sold, pursuant to &sect; 14-150, for approximately $ 2800, thereby extinguishing the lienholder's interest. The court found that &sect; 14-150 was unconstitutional because it denied the lienholder due process of law. Pursuant to the statute, vehicles with a value of $ 500 or less could be sold by garage owners who stored such vehicles and were not paid, so long as the garage owner notified the owner of the vehicle, if known, advertises the sale in a local newspaper three times. The court ruled that notice by publication was insufficient to apprise the lienholder of his rights in such a situation. However, the car repair and storage facility did not have to pay the lienholder damages because the court determined that there was no evidence indicating that it had acted unreasonably or in bad faith when it sold the vehicle according to the provisions set forth in &sect; 14-150.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owner purchased two adjacent residential lots, and later sold one lot. He attempted to sell the second lot, and the potential buyer was informed that the lot did not comply with Westport, Conn. Zoning Regulations &sect; 12-3 because it could not accommodate a 150-foot square within the lot. It could only accommodate a square of 144.47 feet. The owner sought a variance, which the board denied because any hardship was self-created by the owner. The trial court affirmed the finding that the hardship was self-created and also found that the merger doctrine, found in Westport, Conn. Zoning Regulations &sect; 6-3.2, applied to the two lots. The trial court held that the lot had merged with the lot previously sold by the owner. On appeal, the court held that the properties had never merged. In order for the merger provision to take effect the result of the combined lots must have more nearly permitted the 150-foot square within the lot. The trial court created an uneven 150-foot hexagon rather than a square, and there was no proof that the combination of the lots would have accommodated a square larger than 144.47 feet, the size of the square that the single lot could accommodate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case with the direction that it be remanded to the town's zoning board of appeals for a determination of whether the property owner's lot warranted a variance.</SPAN></P>

The developer contended that because the commission failed to render a decision within 65 days of the receipt of the application, the site plan was approved by operation of law. The court affirmed, finding that under the town's zoning regulations the site plan application in the technical park zone did not require a public hearing and that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-7d(b) applied. All decisions had to be made within 65 days of the application date. Although the commission decided to hold a public hearing, the time limit under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-7d(a) did not apply because a public hearing was not required. Section 8-7d(a) made no reference to situations where public hearings were not required but were held at the discretion of the commission. Attendance at commission meetings after the automatic approval date was not a waiver or estoppel because the developer never consented to an extension of time, nor did it intentionally relinquish its right to automatic approval by attending the meetings. The court held that &sect; 8-7d)(b) was not unconstitutional because there was no automatic right of appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff insurance company appealed the judgment from the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven (Connecticut), which granted defendant insured's motion to confirm and denied the insurance company's application to vacate an arbitration award in favor of the insured. The arbitration panel rejected the insurance company's claim that the insured's underinsured motorist claim was barred by a two year limitation under the policy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On April 1, 1986, the insured was injured in an automobile accident. On April 25, 1989, the other driver's insurer agreed to pay the insured the driver's policy's full liability limits. On May 5, 1989, the insured submitted a written claim for underinsured motorist benefits to her insurance company, which disclaimed liability because the claim was not presented within two years of the accident, as required by the terms of the insured's policy. The court held that the 1993 Conn. Acts 93-77, which increased the minimum period for filing a claim for underinsured motorist benefits from two to three years, applied, that a question of fact remained as to whether that time period was tolled, and that the Act was not unconstitutional. The court determined that the Act did not violate Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 or the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, and that, even though it applied retroactively, it did not deprive the insurance company of due process of law because it did not create a substantive right of action. The court remanded the case for a determination of whether the three-year period was tolled, with directions to affirm if it was tolled and reverse if it was not.</SPAN></P>

In the event the trial court found that the time period was not tolled, the judgment was reversed and the cause remanded with directions to grant the application to vacate.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lessor obtained a summary judgment in a certain amount against the tenant for his failure to pay rent. According to the lessor, the only asset of the tenant amenable to execution was the tenant's lottery prize, which was payable in 20 annual installments. The lessor attempted to garnish those payments by serving a property execution on several State officers, each of whom refused to honor the execution. In affirming the judgment that granted the State's motion to dissolve the garnishment, the court ruled that the doctrine of sovereign immunity prevented the lessor from garnishing the lottery winnings of the tenant while they were in the possession of the State. Noting that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 52-350e and 52-350f did not explicitly permit a property execution pursuant to a money judgment to be served on the State or enforced against property of the judgment debtor in possession of the state and that the construction of a statute in derogation of the doctrine of sovereign immunity had to be strict, the court ruled that when, as here, the statute was silent as to the abrogation of the doctrine, sovereign immunity was not abrogated and the lessor's garnishment was barred.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant asserted that the trial court improperly rendered the judgment of conviction because the possession of a Bengal cat, jungle cat, and hybrid bobcat was not specifically prohibited by Conn.

Stat. &sect; 26-55 stated that an animal that resulted from the crossbreeding of any species was considered the wild animal of that species and could not be possessed. Because the crossbreed of a bobcat and a domestic cat was a hybrid bobcat, defendant's possession of the hybrid bobcat was prohibited by the statute. The court stated that the statute gave defendant fair warning that the statute prohibited such possession. Because the statute specifically prohibited bobcats, a person of ordinary intelligence had a reasonable opportunity to know that the possession of a hybrid bobcat was prohibited. However, the court found the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to the jungle cat and the Bengal cat.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, the trial court did not err in denying defendant the right to develop expert surrebuttal testimony because defendant had not been unduly surprised by the testimony and had not suggested a definite period of continuance to obtain the evidence. The trial court's exclusion of a defense expert witness because of a violation of a sequestration order did not prejudice defendant because defendant was able to obtain another expert who testified in the same manner that the first expert would have testified and defendant had no right to have any particular expert testify.

The court affirmed defendant's conviction for criminal possession of a pistol or revolver. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion or unconstitutionally restrict defendant's right of cross-examination in excluding evidence of the dollar amount of the civil action filed against him by the victim. The court held that the trial court properly refused to directly grant defendant's witness immunity without authority to do so. The court found no abuse of discretion in the exclusion of an unavailable witness's uncorroborated declaration against penal interest, which was untrustworthy because it was given a significant time after the shooting and was made in response to questioning by an investigator with whom the witness did not share a close relationship. The court did not reach the issue of whether Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-217(b) mandated a two-year non-suspendable sentence because the sentencing comments showed that the trial court believed the term of incarceration was justified by the facts, including defendant's prior convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that, absent a limiting instruction, the trial court was not required to instruct the jury to take, as true, a prior inconsistent statement given by the victim on the night of the attack. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the statement, which the victim admitted to giving, as a full exhibit because further evidence of the inconsistency was cumulative. The court concluded that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to waive his presence at trial because he did not request a less suggestive in-court identification procedure. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a mistrial because the State's comment that he was trying to twist the evidence was not one that the jury would have interpreted as a comment on his failure to testify.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly (1) denied defendant's motion to suppress a victim's out-of-court identification of him because the photographic array was not unnecessarily suggestive such that it violated defendant's right to due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV; (2) refused to grant defendant's request that it instruct the jury on the crime of robbery in the second degree as a lesser included offense because of defendant's lack of any procedural compliance with Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 852 (now &sect; 854); and (3) found the evidence sufficient to support both convictions because, whether or not defendant actually had a firearm, the evidence supported a finding that defendant threatened the use of a firearm and he committed a trespass to the victim's person when he ordered the victim to get the money and then snatched the money from her hand.</SPAN></P>

The police were engaged in lawful behavior when they engaged in surveillance of the area. Additionally, the police never stopped or detained defendant's car prior to viewing the plastic bag which contained the narcotics. The police officers had the right to be on the public street, stand beside defendant's car and peer into the car. Because the police had probable cause to believe that the evidence seized had a reasonable relationship to the criminal behavior under investigation, the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, defendant approached the witness and she identified him as the perpetrator. Such a procedure was within the trial court's discretion. The procedure for in-court identifications was not of constitutional magnitude. The trial court did not err by failing to order the state to produce the transcript of testimony given by a witness from a previous trial, as the statement was not subject to Conn. Gen. Prac.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with the crime of murder in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Waterbury (Connecticut). The jury returned a verdict of guilty of the lesser-included offense of manslaughter in the first degree. Defendant appealed. The court originally reversed the trial court's judgment; the State appealed to the Supreme Court of Connecticut, which reversed the judgment of the court and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The only issue for the court's decision was the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-55(a)(3), which defined manslaughter in the first degree as, with an extreme indifference to human life, recklessly engaging in conduct creating a grave risk of death to another. Defendant contended that this offense was indistinguishable from Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-56(a)(1), defining manslaughter in the second degree as recklessly causing the death of another. Affirming the conviction, the court held that defendant's failure to raise the constitutionality of &sect; 53a-55(a)(3) at trial, or to object to the instruction given, left the record inadequate for a fair consideration of whether the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him, precluding review. Defendant acknowledged that the essential elements of each lesser included offense were properly charged. His failure to object to the instructions at trial undercut his claim that they clearly deprived him of a fundamental constitutional right and a fair trial. The court found that the claim was not sufficiently egregious to be reviewable as plain error under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 4185.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An informant told a detective that defendant would be at a bar at a specific time with possession of cocaine for sale and that a truck belonging to defendant's son would be outside.

When defendant noticed the three officers approaching him, he turned to his left to evade them and pulled from his pocket a clear plastic bag containing what appeared to be narcotics. The police officers arrested defendant and retrieved the plastic bag from a trash can, which proved to contain cocaine.

The court held that the prosecutor's challenged conduct, while of questionable propriety, was not so prejudicial as to taint the entire proceeding and deprive defendant of a fair trial.

The trial court granted defendants summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff's action was barred by a three-year statute of limitations. Plaintiff challenged the dismissal of his &sect; 1983 claims and the grant of summary judgment. The court concluded that a higher court's disposition of plaintiff's due process claims in an earlier proceeding served as an absolute bar to plaintiff's &sect; 1983 claims. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to defendants on the abuse of process claim on the ground of res judicata.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's arrest occurred after she and others unfurled a banner and shouted &quot;gay rights, lesbian rights&quot; during the governor's state of the state address. Defendant and others were removed from the gallery by the capitol police and later arrested. The chanting and the removal of defendant interrupted the governor's speech for approximately two minutes. The trial court concluded that the gallery, where the incident occurred, was a limited public forum, and that the statute was directed toward behavior, not the content of the expression. Both the state and defendant implicitly agreed that the facts, as given by the state, were sufficient to support defendant's conviction had she been tried, if the statute was constitutional. The court reasoned that if a statute, which implicated the First Amendment, could have been applied to a number of other persons and situations to inhibit free speech, it was facially invalid even if it could have had some legitimate applications. The court concluded that &sect; 2-1d(a)(2)(E) was unconstitutional as overbroad because the proscriptions of subparagraph (E) were unlimited and could not have been made to conform to due process requirements.</SPAN></P>

The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court's denial of his request to remove counsel and for a continuance denied him his due process rights.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was seriously hurt when a truck belonging to the owner, and being driven by one of the owner's employees, crashed into plaintiff's car.

The trial court also denied the owner's motion to reduce the amount of plaintiff's award. Both parties appealed, and the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court held that plaintiff made an offer of judgment that encompassed an offer to settle the entire case, and the owner failed to accept this offer. Because the amount ultimately awarded to plaintiff by the jury exceeded the offer of judgment, the trial court was compelled under the express language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-192a to award plaintiff interest on the amount of his recovery. However, the owner was not entitled to have the amount of the award reduced by the amounts paid to plaintiff by his insurance providers. The amount paid by plaintiff to secure his medical benefits exceeded the amount he received, and thus the trial court properly refused to reduce the economic damages awarded.</SPAN></P>

After learning that the license number was not in the computer, the trooper pulled defendant over. Defendant identified himself, and the dog alerted at the truck of the car. When no drugs were found in the trunk, the trooper reasoned that the odor was carried by the wind from the front of the car. A cellophane envelope containing marijuana was found under the battery. The court declined to review defendant's claims that the police unconstitutionally &quot;seized&quot; him and his car, and that the dog sniff was unconstitutional, because the claims were made for the first time in his reply brief. Further, the record was inadequate to review the claims. The trial court did not make factual findings on those issues for the court to review.

After defendant was convicted of burglary in the first degree, assault of a victim 60 or older in the third degree, and unlawful restraint in the first degree, he appealed. The court affirmed the convictions. The jury could have concluded that the victim was exposed to a substantial risk of injury. The state presented the jury with ample evidence to conclude reasonably that defendant entered the house intending to commit larceny. The trial court denied a motion to suppress his sneakers as tangible evidence. The trial court properly ruled that the police searched his apartment and seized the sneakers with his freely given consent. A claim that defendant's later inculpatory sworn statement to the police resulted from police misconduct in obtaining the sneakers lacked merit. The trial court properly denied a motion to suppress the victim's in-court identification. The victim's initial identification was not the result of a suggestive identification procedure. There was no constitutional infirmity in the identification process.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought an action against defendant, the Commissioner of the Department of Children and Youth Services, following defendant's proposed removal of a child from foster care, alleging that certain procedures used by defendant were unconstitutional. The trial court found that plaintiff lacked standing and entered judgment in favor of defendant. On appeal, the court concluded that the case presented exceptional circumstances and that an action could be commenced by plaintiff, a next friend, for the purposes of protecting the child's interests, even though he already had counsel and a guardian ad litem to protect those interests. However, because the count was brought on the child's behalf, the declaratory judgment action belonged to the child, not to plaintiff. The constitutional right of the child, a liberty interest in safety, established the necessary foundation for both the procedural due process and equal protection claims asserted by the child. The court concluded that the procedures by which defendant removed a child from a foster home and returned him to the home of a family member violated the child's constitutional right to procedural due process.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from his conviction, defendant argued that the trial court erred in ruling that the State had not discriminatorily employed a peremptory challenge, in failing to set aside inconsistent verdicts, and in evoking his probation. In reversing, the court held that the trial judge, in accord with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-82f and the state constitution, had the duty to preside in person over voir dire and his failure to do so deprived defendant of the right to a public trial by an impartial jury. The court found that it was not possible to address defendant's argument regarding the exercise of peremptory challenges due to the trial judge's absence, which the court ruled was not harmless error and was not cured by defendant's apparent waiver because the right of the excluded juror to serve was also at stake. The court ruled that defendant's acquittal of a lesser included offense did not mandate reversal because consistency in verdicts was not required and that the trial court erred in revoking probation without due process under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-32 and Conn. Prac. Book &sect; 943.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the superior court had correctly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction for declaratory relief because the claim was not based on an actual controversy. The possibility of future church expansion failed to overcome the mootness doctrine because, if expansion occurred, there was time to appeal. The special permit procedure had not violated U.S. Const. amend. I because the restrictions were necessary for the important purpose of safety and welfare in residential areas. The zoning ordinance was content-neutral and applied to clubs, community centers, and nursery schools.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The student was walking across the high school courtyard when he slipped and fell on a sheet of ice. He fractured his left elbow. The area was not sanded or salted. There were no warnings issued to the students about its condition. The school's policy was that the head custodian was to inspect the area and order sanding and salting as necessary. Plaintiffs filed an action in four counts seeking damages for the student's injuries. Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment as to all counts except the count for nuisance, which was directed against the city and the board of education. Defendants argued that they were protected from liability by governmental immunity. The trial court granted the motion and plaintiffs appealed. The court noted that the decision whether to salt or sand the area around the high school was not made by the superintendent. Even if the superintendent had possessed a duty with regard to maintaining conditions on the high school grounds, it would have been a discretionary rather than a ministerial duty. As such, it would have fallen within the ambit of governmental immunity. Moreover, the foreseeable victim exception did not apply to the case.</SPAN></P>

The victim finally confided in another teacher regarding her relationship with defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed the sexual assault and risk of injury to a child convictions. The court held that the defense of emancipation did not exist in criminal matters; therefore, the trial court properly rejected the defense. At trial, defendant failed to object to the jury instructions that on appeal he claimed had denied him a fair trial. Accordingly, one of the elements that defendant had to prove to prevail on that argument was that a constitutional violation clearly existed and clearly deprived defendant of a fair trial. Defendant did not meet that burden. The court found that the jury charge as a whole fairly presented the issues, that no reasonable possibility existed that the jury was misled by the charge, and that the trial court fairly and properly differentiated between the elements of the offenses charged in the information. Defendant did not have to know or have reason to know that the victim was under age 16 in order to be found guilty under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-71(a)(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), which convicted him of rioting at a correctional institution in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-179b(a). Defendant claimed that &sect; 53a-179b(a) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his conduct violated &sect; 53a-179b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was identified as having been among those inmates at the front of the group that marched prior to the riot. Defendant refused to obey an order to clear the yard and refused to heed an officer's attempt to prevent the escalation of the inmates' activities. The trial court found that by refusing to cooperate with the attempts to maintain calm, and by marching with the inmates, defendant aided, abetted, assisted, and took part in the disorder in violation of &sect; 53a-179b, which was therefore not unconstitutionally vague. Moreover, &sect; 53a-179b was specifically directed at two groups: those who led or planned disturbances at a correctional institution and those who followed in the proscribed activity. Section 53a-179b, as construed by the courts, did not reach a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct. Therefore, defendant's overbreadth argument failed. Finally, the evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant's conduct violated &sect; 53a-179b. The trial court reasonably could have believed officers' testimony that defendant repeatedly failed to obey the orders to clear the yard, and that defendant was seen marching at the front of the group before the riot.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that, although the parties had recognized the jurisdictional considerations, they sought to argue their claims. However, the court held that appellate jurisdiction could not be conferred on the court by agreement. The court held that neither of the circumstances under which an interlocutory order was appealable pertained. The trial court's order neither terminated a separate and distinct proceeding, nor so concluded the rights of the parties that further proceedings could not affect them. A decision affecting the merits of a controversy could not be separate and distinct and the rights of the parties had not been concluded, so any further proceedings would necessarily affect them.

The trial court rejected defendant's argument that the collision was accidental, and defendant was convicted of the charged offense. Defendant appealed, challenging the statute under the void for vagueness doctrine. In affirming, the court concluded that the first part of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21 proscribed conduct evidencing deliberate indifference to or the creation of situations that could be harmful to the minor's physical welfare. Where defendant placed the child into his car, pursued another vehicle at a high speed, and then rammed into that other vehicle, the possibilities for injury to the child were significant.

It was clear that exposing oneself to a child was an act that was &quot;likely to impair the morals&quot; of that child. Defendant's actions led the court to the conclusion that he knew what he was doing was prohibited because he lured the children to a secluded area, asked them if anyone was coming, and asked them to act as guards.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant complained that the trial court failed to suppress identification evidence, declined his request for an in-court lineup, and did not sever the offenses. He argued that the photographic array shown to the victims was impermissibly suggestive because his photo was the only one that matched the victims' full description of the robber. The court noted that the victims had ample opportunity to view the unmasked defendant at close range, in sufficient lighting, and they focused on the robber as he pointed a gun at them. Further, the victims gave accurate, detailed descriptions and were certain in selecting defendant's photograph. The court held that, under the totality of the circumstances, the trial court did not err in finding that the out-of-court identifications were reliable. Thus, the in-court identifications were also reliable, and defendant was not entitled to an in-court lineup. Finally, there was no error in trying the offenses together. The two robberies were similar events, the State's presentation was comprehensible to the jury and organized chronologically by separate incident, and the trial court's instructions emphasized that there were two separate crimes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk, Geographical Area Number Twenty (Connecticut), which convicted him of disorderly conduct, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-182, and fined him $ 250. The charges against defendant resulted from his attempt to effect a peaceful, self-help repossession of a copy machine, pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 42a-9-503.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-182 was unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to the facts. The court noted that, while defendant's challenge was not distinctly raised at trial, it fell within the parameters of Golding and warranted appellate scrutiny. However, because the record was inadequate for a fair consideration, the court declined to review the claim. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction because the State showed that defendant resorted to cursing, screaming, and physical force in attempting to repossess the machine. His alternative was to await the lessees' momentary return and discuss the matter. The court was unconvinced by defendant's claim that the physical force was a necessary incident to a perceived larceny. The court opined that the controlling lease was not within the express language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-119(13)(A), and that the trial court properly rejected defendant's asserted legal justification. The court found that the trial court erred in finding that statements proffered to show their effect on defendant were hearsay. However, no prejudice or injustice inured to defendant.</SPAN></P>

The landlord moved for a new trial under &sect; 51-183b when the trial court did not enter a written judgment within 120 days after the conclusion of the trial. On review from an adverse judgment, the tenants argued that &sect; 51-183b was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers provision under Conn. Const. art. II, that it was inapplicable to actions under the CUTPA, and that no provision for setting aside a judgment was provided as a remedy in the statute. The court affirmed the judgment and concluded that &sect; 51-183b did not violate the separation of powers provision of the Connecticut Constitution because it was a statute relating to the jurisdiction of the courts, a subject that is exclusively a province of the legislature under Conn. Const. art. V, &sect; 1. Moreover, the court found that although no remedy existed in the statute, it had been created judicially by prior decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted after a jury trial in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven of robbery in the first degree as an accessory, conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, and hindering prosecution in the first degree. Defendant sought appellate review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant's challenged statements, made when he was being routinely booked, were properly admitted into evidence. The court held that defendant failed to preserve as issues on appeal the denial of his right to cross-examine the victim as to his prior convictions, the jury instructions as to circumstantial evidence, and the alleged failure to properly charge the jury on circumstantial evidence, and to give a specific unanimity instruction on the conspiracy and hindering counts. Defendant also claimed that his double jeopardy rights were violated when he was convicted both as a principal on robbery charges and for hindering prosecution. Although the issue was not preserved for appeal, because of its constitutional implications, the court examined the record and found that there was no double jeopardy in the case at bar because robbery required proof of larceny, whereas hindering prosecution required proof of criminal assistance to another who committed a class A or B felony. The court held that the charged crimes did not arise out of the same act or transaction. The court denied defendant's claims of error and affirmed his convictions.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the charged crimes that defendant contended violated the Double Jeopardy Clause did not arise out of the same act or transaction. The court affirmed the trial court's judgments of conviction and dismissed defendant's appeal.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The jury could have reasonably concluded that the amount possessed by defendant was not intended for his personal use. A trier of fact could have reasonably concluded at the close of the State's case, without any consideration of defendant's evidence, that the State had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed narcotics with an intent to sell them.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant received a 23-year sentence for robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first-degree and assault in the second-degree. On appeal, he alleged that the trial court improperly admitted testimony concerning a pretrial identification of him and the denial of his motion not sever his trial from those of his codefendants. The court affirmed the judgment. The court ruled that there were no requirements that the witness should have been shown a certain number of photographs. The court held that defendant failed to establish that a constitutional violation existed and deprived him of a fair trial. Therefore, the pretrial identification procedure was found not to be unnecessarily suggestive. The court upheld the denial of defendant's motion to sever because defendant failed to specify what, if any, evidence was admitted at the joint trial of defendants that would not have been admissible at his separate trial. The fact that defendant was the only codefendant to present an alibi defense did not render the denial of his motion an abuse of discretion. His alibi was not antagonistic to his codefendant's claims of innocence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim told police that defendant had asked her to enter an office where he ripped off her pants, pushed her back on the floor, and sexually assaulted her. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court's charge to the jury improperly enlarged the offense of sexual assault in the first degree. The trial court instructed the jury that it could convict defendant if it found that he had compelled the victim to engage in sexual intercourse by either the use of force against her, or the threat of use of force. Although &sect; 53a-70(a)(1) created liability under both theories, the substituted information alleged that defendant had violated the statute only by the use of force. The State conceded that there was no evidence on the threat of use of force. The court concluded that the jury was improperly charged. Ten months before trial and following an examination, defendant was found competent to stand trial. Although he claimed that his amnesia impaired his ability to assist counsel in the preparation of his defense, he failed to renew his claim or to request a contemporaneous examination at the time of his trial.

The record was inadequate, and there was ample evidence on which the jury reasonably could have concluded that defendants did not sincerely believe the representations that they made to the victims regarding fortune-telling and other metaphysical matters.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners sought review of a decision by the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut), which dismissed their appeal of a decision by defendant, a town wetlands commission, that denied their request for a permit pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 22a-39(h) to construct a dwelling and driveway within the wetlands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission denied the permit requested because the proposed plan would have a significant impact on the wetlands. The owners also had two other lots, one adjacent to the lot in question and one across the street. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court determined that the owners had the burden of proving that a feasible and prudent alternative to their construction plan did not exist. The court found that one commissioner's questioning of the existence of an alternative was not equivalent to a finding that no alternative existed. With respect to the commission's consideration of the adjacent lot, the court held that the commission did not exceed its authority under Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 4-183(j)(6) because whether the owners had an interest in an adjoining lot was relevant to a determination of whether a permit should be granted. Although the owners alleged an unconstitutional taking of their property, the court found that that claim could not be reached until a final authoritative decision by the commission had been made because a future application with a different excavation and construction plan could be granted.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was driving a truck as part of her duties as a department of transportation employee and she used an exit in which the use of a truck was prohibited. In an effort to make a traffic light while still green, defendant operated the truck at a speed that made it impossible to negotiate a turn at the bottom of the exit ramp. The vehicle overturned onto a passenger car, killing the driver and seriously injuring a passenger. The court found that only due process and ex post facto claims were argued before the trial court, and claims that were not distinctly raised at trial were not reviewable on appeal. The due process and ex post facto claims were not reviewable because they were not asserted in accordance with the rules of practice and were deemed waived. The court noted that whether the evidence established defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was a question of fact for the jury and the jury resolved the question against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the contractor satisfied the statutory requirement to petition the court within 90 days of the effective date of &sect; 2, because the contractor's motion was pending on July 1, 1991, and was thereafter heard and determined by the trial court on September 2, 1991, within the statutory period.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to prosecute them because their indictments were obtained from unconstitutionally selected grand juries.

Had they raised a challenge to the grand jury array during the pretrial proceedings, any possible defect could have been cured through a new indictment. This claim was a constitutional challenge to pretrial proceedings. The equal protection claim did not go to the State's power over petitioners and the charged offenses. All petitioners were indicted by a grand jury as required. Petitioners' equal protection challenges related to the composition of the grand jury and not to the grand jury's underlying power to issue an indictment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction. The court held that where a person might be convicted under more than one statutory alternative, the judgment could not be supported unless the evidence was sufficient to establish guilt under each statutory provision that the trier might have relied upon. The jury reasonably could have found that when defendant, while waving a knife, chased a restaurant employee after she had closed the cash drawer, he was threatening the immediate use of physical force on her for the purpose of overcoming her resistance to the taking of property, which was sufficient evidence to support its jury instruction that defined robbery under both statutory subdivisions. An indirect comment in argument to the court on a point of law was less serious than a comment in jury summation that asked the jury to infer that defendant's silence was evidence of guilt. Thus, the State's remarks were not forbidden prosecutorial comments on defendant's failure to testify. The evidence and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom provided adequate support for the State's closing argument. Defendant was fully allowed to cross-examine the witnesses.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon being convicted of attempted murder and carrying a pistol without a permit, defendant argued on appeal that it was error to deny his motion to suppress the results of an atomic absorption test. Defendant contended that the test results were the fruit of an unconstitutional seizure of his person because law officers did not have a warrant for his arrest prior to entering his home. The court affirmed the judgment. Specifically, the court held that where two witnesses and the victim identified defendant as being the perpetrator of the attempted murder, law officers had probable cause to arrest defendant. Furthermore, the court found that the warrantless arrest of defendant in his home was justified by exigent circumstances under the Dorman test where, among other factors, the offense of attempted murder was grave and violent, the victim had been shot while he lay injured on the ground, and the gun used for the crime was not found at the crime scene, leading to the conclusion that defendant continued to be armed with the weapon. The court also found that the officers had reasonable grounds to believe that if an immediate arrest were not made, defendant would likely flee.</SPAN></P>

An officer arrived while defendant was sitting in his car with the lights on. The officer parked behind his car and turned on the cruiser's overhead light. As he approached the car he detected a strong odor of alcohol. Defendant saw the officer and turned on the ignition. The officer asked him to exit and defendant failed field sobriety tests. He entered a conditional plea of nolo contendere after the trial court denied his motion to suppress. On appeal, the court affirmed. The point at which defendant was seized was not when the officer turned on the cruiser's light but when defendant turned on his ignition as if to leave. At that point, the officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227a was occurring. The facts justified defendant's detention for the limited intrusion of field sobriety testing to confirm or dispel the officer's suspicion. When defendant turned on his ignition, he committed an offense in the presence of the officer, as &sect; 14-227a did not require that defendant actually move the vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The board had standing because it was classically aggrieved by the amendment, which deprived the board of its right under Conn. Gen.

Also, the trial court properly refused to consider irrelevant case law cited by the commission in concluding that the amendment improperly eliminated the board's authority to grant use variances. Finally, the trial court did not improperly rely on the testimony of a town planner in ascertaining the commission's reasons for enacting the amendment to the exclusion of all other testimony and did not substitute its judgment for that of the commission.</SPAN></P>

The testimony of the victim reasonably supported the conclusion that defendant was not the principal, but rather an aider or abettor. There was substantial evidence presented at trial to support the instruction on accessory. A witness testified that defendant told her that he did not shoot her brother. When she accused defendant of being present at the shooting, defendant made no response. The court found that defendant's failure to respond to the accusation was an admission by silence. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the testimony as an admission of guilt. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal as to the charge of assault in the first degree because the jury could reasonably have found that the victim suffered serious physical injury.</SPAN></P>

Defendant also alleged that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that the crime of manslaughter in the first degree with a firearm was a lesser included offense of the crime of murder. The court held that the trial court erred in including the use of a firearm to the lesser included offense of manslaughter. The information did not allege the use of a firearm. Manslaughter with a firearm required proof of an additional element that was not a necessary element of the crime of murder and violated defendant's right to know the exact nature of the charges against him. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in restricting defendant's presentation of his defense by prohibiting him from questioning defense witnesses as to whether they knew why defendant carried a gun.

The court held that because no liberty interest was implicated by the prisoner's claims, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over the subject mater and properly dismissed the petition. Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-125 created no protected constitutional or statutory liberty interest in parole release that gave rise to a claim of illegal confinement in a habeas action. The statute vested board discretion in the judgment of the parole board. It did not give an inmate any right to demand or even apply for parole. It did not require that a parole board actually consider any inmate's eligibility for parole if he fulfilled the statute's two requirements. Although the prisoner alleged that his confinement was illegal because the parole board did not adhere to the UAPA's procedures for rule-making, no such liberty interest could arise.</SPAN></P>

The crime was defined by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70. The trial court had refused to allow defendant access to the victim's hospital alcohol-treatment records and a related psychiatric evaluation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim proffered during trial that approximately a year after the assault he went into a 30-day alcoholism program at a hospital and had a psychiatric interview as part of the program. Defendant contended that the denial of the hospital records and the stymieing of a line of questioning about the record violated his right to confrontation as he could not show the witness' mental condition, which might reasonably have affected that witness' credibility. Relevant was a witness' mental soundness at the time of trial and at the time of the incident about which the witness was to testify. There was no evidence that the victim was inebriated at the time of the crime. Defendant did not ask whether or not the victim had been drinking heavily at or about the time of trial or on either of the two days on which he gave testimony. His hospitalization was remote in time from the time of the assault. The court ruled that defendant had failed to make a preliminary showing that there was a reasonable probability that the hospital records were material, and, thus, no further steps such as an in camera inspection of the records with the victim's permission were required.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found for the State and defendant pleaded nolo contendere and appealed. The State contended that the Gates standard applied to warrants based on informant information, and that the Gates standard should apply where an investigation already existed and the informant only identified a suspect or corroborated facts. The court held that the totality of the circumstances analysis of Gates was sufficient to guarantee defendant's constitutional rights and where the affidavit inferred that sufficient probable cause existed to execute the search, the inadequacy of the affidavit did not render the search unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that he was deprived of a fair trial by the trial court's failure to sua sponte order a new trial. The court affirmed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting and later striking prejudicial evidence. Stricken testimony was cumulative in nature, curative instructions were very thorough, and the trial court's actions followed defendant's request. Defendant's right to a fair trial was protected. Two requirements were met that entitled the State to a missing witness charge: (1) the witness was available; and (2) he was a witness whom the party would naturally produce. When those two conditions existed, the court held that an inference could be drawn that the testimony of that witness was unfavorable to the party's cause. Defendant failed to show that a single misstatement regarding the charge affected the verdict. The court held that alleged prosecutorial misconduct was not severe and counsel for defendant neither objected to the remarks nor asked for a curative instruction.</SPAN></P>

Defendant called the police officer and talked to him about the drug deal and the robbery. The appellate court found that defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not violated when he talked to the police officer after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings and in the absence of his attorney because, of his own volition, defendant initiated the conversation by telephoning the police officer.

The trial court properly refused to instruct the jury that there was insufficient evidence presented to convict defendant of carrying a weapon in a motor vehicle because there was ample evidence from which the jury could have inferred that defendant knowingly possessed a weapon in that car. Also, the court did not find that any extraneous facts arose from the consolidation of defendant's two informations for trial because defendant failed to meet his heavy burden of demonstrating that substantial prejudice resulted from the joinder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court framed the issue as whether or not the zoning regulation as applied to the landowners' properties was so unreasonable and confiscatory as to be for all practical purposes a taking of private property for public use. A balancing test was used to decide whether or not a taking had occurred. That balancing test required that the trial court consider the degree of diminution in value of the particular piece of property and the nature and degree of the public harm to be prevented and the realistic alternative uses available to the landowners. The court found that balanced against the finding that the properties were substantially diminished in value and that there were no realistic alternative uses other than use as residential lots, which would cause the diminution, was the finding that there would be minimal harm if any to the public if the zoning change were not effected. The court ruled that the trial court's finding that the zoning change as applied to the landowners was unreasonable and confiscatory was supported by ample evidence and thus could not be disturbed.</SPAN></P>

However, the exclusionary rule did not bar the state from using the evidence if the taint resulting from the violation was sufficiently attenuated from the initial entry into the home.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission denied the motel owner's application for a special permit a 10 unit addition onto his motel. The trial court sustained the motel owner's appeal of the denial and ordered the commission to approve the permit application.

The commission subsequently rejected the motel owner's submission of revised plans to it for an eight unit addition. The trial court sustained the motel owner's appeal of that decision. The commission appealed. The court held that the parties could not settle their prior litigation without trial court approval and as such, the trial court's original decision was still in effect at the time the motel owner submitted revised plans to the commission. Moreover, an application conforming with applicable zoning regulations at the time of its filing could not be disapproved for its failure to comply with subsequent zoning changes and thus, the fact that zoning rules had changed while the litigation was pending did not bar enforcement of the regulations in force at the time of the motel owner's original application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owner appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Fairfield (Connecticut), which dismissed his appeal from the action of defendant town conservation commission in denying his application for permission to construct a stream crossing within a wetland and a watercourse area. The owner's action also named as defendants, the town clerk and the state commissioner of environmental protection.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought to resubdivide a lot into two separate parcels and build a second house on one of the parcels. The application at issue sought permission to install two box culverts to create a driveway crossing a stream. The owner appealed on the grounds including that the commission abused its discretion in failing to approve the application. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the commission did not abuse its discretion by virtue of its failure to adopt the recommendation of the staff of the town's inland wetlands agency to conditionally approve the owner's application. The statutory scheme for the resolution of permit applications, including Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22a-42(c), 22a-42a(c), (d), and 22a-41, envisioned that the authorized agency itself shall be the decision maker. Further, the trial court correctly found that the commission's denial of the owner's application was not clearly erroneous. The stream crossing was found to be unnecessary because upland access on the lot was feasible and prudent. Finally, there was no evidence to support the owner's claim that the commission's action constituted an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction. The court, in noting that defendant raised no affirmative statutory defense that would have placed a burden of proof on him, held that the jury was properly instructed on the presumption of innocence afforded defendant and on the State's burden to prove every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The court ruled that the trial court's charge that the basic facts leading to the inferences must have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt was incorrect. However, the incorrect charge constituted harmful error because it was cured by other portions of the charge.

The officer observed a successive pattern in which seven persons approached defendant on foot and entered the hallway with him for two or three minutes before exiting and leaving. After a white male entered and left, the officer arrested him. Defendant fled. Another officer spotted defendant and found 29 small glassine envelopes containing a white powder substance, later identified as heroin. The white suspect could not identify defendant as the person who had sold drugs to him. A jury convicted defendant. The court affirmed. To convict defendant, the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a sale occurred and that it was defendant who delivered the heroin. Although the officer had not observed an actual sale because of defendant's use of a darkened hallway, the circumstances he observed that night clearly supported his opinion of a sale, by logical inference. The court did not consider some appellate issues because defendant had not preserved the issues and the unpreserved claims were not of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted, after his conditional plea of nolo contendere, of driving while his license was under suspension in the trial court. In affirming the conviction, the court held that defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were not violated by the investigatory stop. The court concluded that the officer had reasonable articulable suspicion and conducted himself within the scope of his authority under &sect; 14-217 in stopping defendant to determine his identity and his license status. The court reasoned that the state had a compelling interest in making sure only drivers with valid licenses operated vehicles on the public roads. The court noted the stop was minimally intrusive because defendant got out of his vehicle on his own initiative and was not searched or arrested. The court found that the anonymous tip provided a clear and detailed description of the garbage truck, its location, and the location of the occupants. The court concluded that the details of the tip were corroborated because the caller's prediction about defendant's future behavior was enough to establish the caller's reliability, that he was informed, and the information was not an inarticulable hunch.</SPAN></P>

The statute provided defendant with fair notice that he need not physically touch a child to violate &sect; 53-21 and that the photographing of nude and seminude children was prohibited. The trial court's denial of his motion to suppress the photographs was proper because the officers executing the warrants, acted in good faith, and their reliance upon the warrants was objectively reasonable.

Defendant claimed that his activities were authorized by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 26-142a(a) in that he was assisting a licensed fisherman. The trial court found that defendant was not acting as a mere assistant, but was in joint control of the boat with the other man. The court held that there was ample evidence to conclude that defendant was in control of the lobstering activities. The definition of &sect; 26-142a was not vague and without standards for enforcement, and defendant was not without fair notice that his activities would not qualify as assisting. The court found no unconstitutional vagueness in the provisions of &sect; 26-61(d) or 26-142a(a), and no unconstitutional conflict in the statutory scheme. One who had his fishing license suspended could never, during the period of suspension, be classified as one &quot;not licensed&quot; for the purposes of the assistant exception in &sect; 26-142a(a). Defendant was not an unlicensed person; he was a person with a suspended license and did not, therefore, come within the exemption of &sect; 26-142a(a).</SPAN></P>

The court held that defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of the rape shield laws was unpreserved. The court refused to review of the claim because it was a challenge to the constitutionality of an action of the legislature and not a challenge to an action of a trial court. Therefore, the court concluded that defendant was not entitled to review. Further, the court ruled that defendant was not clearly deprived of a fair trial. The court held that the trial court properly excluded the offered evidence of the victim's prior complaints of sexual assault. The court found that defendant failed to establish that either of the victim's other complaints were false because the man in the first complaint pleaded guilty and the second case was still pending. Therefore, the evidence was irrelevant and properly excluded. Moreover, the court ruled that the trial court properly allowed the State to file a second substitute information after the close of evidence but before the start of counsels' arguments to the jury because it did not prejudice defendant.</SPAN></P>

The trial court subsequently granted defendant's modification request and reduced the period of incarceration to time served and increased the probation period to three years. The State's motion for reconsideration was denied. The court reversed, holding that defendant's sentence was not illegal because he was not prejudiced by the clerk's failure to give written notice of defendant's right to apply for sentence review, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 51-195. Defendant's sentence was clearly legal at the time it was imposed in that it was within the permissible range for the crimes charged. The jurisdiction of the trial court terminated when the sentence was imposed. Because the sentence was for more than three years, the modification statute,&nbsp;Conn. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New London (Connecticut), which convicted him on two counts of failure to assist a peace officer in violation of Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers saw a suspect run into defendant's apartment.

Defendant was charged with hindering prosecution and interference with a peace officer but was only convicted of failure to assist in violation of &sect; 53a-167b(a). Defendant's due process rights were not violated by these counts being added on trial day. Under Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 623, additions were allowed prior to trial, and criminal trials did not begin until voir dire. Defendant's sole theory against the other charges was that he was actually assisting the officers, and this defense was relevant to the added charges. Defendant's record was not adequate to review his claim that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-167b(a) was vague and overbroad. The trial court did not err in refusing to read U.S. Const. amend. IV to the jury because defendant's liberty guarantees were not at issue according to his defense. The jury could have found that the officers were authorized to demand assistance because they were entitled to enter private premises when in hot pursuit of a fleeing felon.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Nearly five years after the board granted a firefighter a disability pension on the basis of the firefighter's heart condition, the firefighter applied to be removed from the disability rolls and to be reinstated to his former position.

On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment and held that the trial court properly found that the firefighter was aggrieved by the board's decision because the decision caused the firefighter to lose his life insurance policy, to become unable to obtain medical insurance, and to be deprived of his career employment. The firefighter presented uncontroverted medical evidence from three doctors that he was not disabled. Thus, under City of Waterbury, Conn., Charter and Related Laws &sect; 2746, the firefighter had a right to be reinstated. The 1962 civil service amendment in the 1962 Home Rule Act referendum to the city's charter (1962 civil service amendment) was enacted before the amendments to City of Waterbury, Conn., Charter and Related Laws &sect; 2746 and did not cover retirements. Thus, &sect; 2746 was not implicitly repealed by the 1962 civil service amendment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment which reversed a city's retirement board's decision denying a firefighter's application to be removed from the board's disability pension rolls and to be reinstated to his former position.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The tribal chief's motion to dismiss contended that the trial court lacked civil jurisdiction over an Indian tribal dispute. The trial court granted the motion and characterized the dispute as concerning whether the tribal chief was actually the chief, with authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the Indian tribe. The Indian tribe, however, did not deny in its complaint that he was the tribal chief, but alleged only that, as chief, he failed to obtain the consent and approval of the tribal counsel before entering into the contract. The court reasoned that the basis of the state's statutory rights and obligations to manage tribal lands and to recover misappropriated tribal property, were civil-regulatory in nature and, therefore, were preempted and rendered invalid by federal law. The court dismissed the state's appeal, holding that it followed that the state lacked aggrieved party status because it did not derive a recognizable interest in this case.</SPAN></P>

The court held that evidence of his prior sexual misconduct with his victim was admissible to prove a pattern of criminal activity, and that the probative value of such evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect. The court found that the evidence was admissible for the limited purpose of showing defendant's pattern of criminal sexual activity with the victim.

The court affirmed the judgment, finding no error. The court found no trace in the record of any instigative or vindictive conduct by the trial court. Although the court agreed that defendant should not have been put to plea on the original Part B information, the court found that defendant was not prejudiced or unfairly surprised by the violation because ultimately the State proceeded before a different trial judge under a substitute Part B information about which defendant was properly advised. The court held that the trial court did not err by permitting the State to file the substitute Part B information because defendant did not move to strike the substitute information.

The court rejected defendant's arguments and affirmed. The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting the in-court identification.

On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the corporation had presented evidence that the wife paid the corporation $ 65,000 for the property and that she took the property subject to a mechanic's lien in the amount of $ 20,000. Further, the corporation showed that the condominium had suffered $ 1000 in water damage from a leaking sprinkler and was missing appliances worth approximately $ 1000. The creditor presented no witnesses; he merely rested on the affidavits filed with his ex parte action. The court concluded that the creditor had failed to sustain his burden of showing that either the corporation had conveyed the property for less than substantial consideration and was thereby rendered unable to pay the alleged debts or that the conveyance was made with a fraudulent intent that the wife shared.</SPAN></P>

The superior court entered judgment awarding possession to the owner and taxed costs and expenses in favor of the owner because of the tenants' weak case and abusive pleadings. The tenants appealed.

The court found that the record clearly supported the superior court's conclusion that the tenants had not paid the rent due and owing to the owner for the period noticed in the complaint. The record also contained ample evidence from which the superior court could reasonably have concluded that the parties began an oral month-to-month tenancy at the termination of their written lease.

Although sexual assault charges were dismissed, evidence showed that defendant's penis touched her lips. The court found that the phrase &quot;any person&quot; contained in Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53-21 was not limited to adults and was properly applied to defendant even though he was a minor. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to defendant. Defendant's acts constituted lewd behavior within the reach of the statute and fell with in the definition of sexual contact contained at Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-65(3). The court held that acts likely to impair the morals of a minor included the deliberate touching of a child under 16 with one's private parts in a sexual and indecent manner.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for robbery in the first degree, which required the use of a firearm. The court found that the evidence warranted a modification of the judgment to the lesser charge of robbery in the third degree, in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-136. In rejecting defendant's other claims, the court found that defendant's statements subsequent to the alleged criminal act were admissible to show consciousness of guilt. The court found no error in the consciousness of guilt instruction because it did not unconstitutionally shift the State's burden of proof. The court held that the trial court's decision to admit the photo array did not violate defendant's due process rights; an array composed of different individuals necessarily contained differences.</SPAN></P>

Because defendant allegedly was bothering women parishioners and using the church for personal meetings, the church asked him to stop attending church services.

The court held that defendant's claim that the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the requisite knowledge that he was not licensed to enter church property was without merit. Defendant entered the church property as a knowing trespasser. Defendant had been unequivocally informed and understood that his privilege to attend church services had been revoked. A business invitee could be charged with simple trespass in areas open to the public as long as there was evidence that he entered with knowledge that he was not privileged to do so. The State could discriminate between simple and criminal trespass because there was some natural and substantial difference germane to the subject and purposes of the legislation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the denial by the Superior Court in the judicial district of New London (Connecticut) of his motion to correct an illegal sentence, which he alleged arose out of the trial court's revocation of his probation pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-32. He argued that the trial court exceeded its statutory authority and violated his federal due process rights and his double jeopardy rights under the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The effect of the resentencing by the probation revocation sentencing court was that defendant had to serve 16 years in prison. On appeal, the court held that the revocation sentencing court had the statutory authority to impose a sentence for the underlying offense that ran consecutive to the sentence for intervening offense of robbery. The revocation sentencing court was neither limited to the imposition of a concurrent sentence nor prevented from imposing a longer effective sentence than originally could have been imposed. Because defendant raised the issue for the first time on appeal, his claim that his state double jeopardy rights were violated by the procedure could not be considered. Further, the doctrine of double jeopardy did not apply to revocation proceedings. Defendant's federal due process rights were not violated; his original 10 year sentence was reimposed, not a more severe sentence. Further, the revocation sentencing court did not act vindictively. Although defendant's claim that his due process rights were violated by the consideration of erroneous information was reviewable, he had not shown that the revocation sentencing court relied on that information.</SPAN></P>

The provisions of Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 752 and Conn. Gen.

When the victim started toward a melee that included defendant's sister, defendant struck him with a pool cue. Defendant claimed that he was justified in using force to defend his sister. On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in its charge to the jury on justified physical force in defense of a third person as defined by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-19 by incorrectly defining &quot;initial aggressor&quot; so as to eliminate defendant's justification if the jurors found that the victim had threatened imminent physical harm but defendant had been the first to strike a blow. Defendant failed to file a relevant request to charge and failed to object to the charge as given. The court held that defendant's claim of an erroneous jury instruction was not truly of constitutional proportions, and that the instructions as a whole fairly presented the case to the jury so that no injustice was done to defendant's legal rights. The court also declined to review the unpreserved claim under the doctrine of plain error, finding that the definition of initial aggressor did not result in an unreliable verdict.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed, holding that defendant's challenge to a jury instruction regarding presumption of innocence, which was not raised at trial, failed to reach constitutional proportions for purposes of review. The instruction that the law was made to protect society and the innocent and not the guilty did not dilute the presumption of innocence because it was used in conjunction with a clear instruction both as to the presumption of innocence and as to the duty of the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt defendant's guilt. Defendant's challenge to another jury instruction, also not raised at trial, failed because he simply put a constitutional label on a nonconstitutional claim. The court evaluated the questioned jury instruction in context and found it to be proper. The court did not disturb the sentence because it was within statutory limits and had a reasonable basis.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant offered to sell heroin to an undercover officer. The officer purchased the heroin, initialed and dated the packet, and had it field-tested. The officer identified defendant's picture from a photo array. Defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with the sale of heroin by a person who is not drug-dependent. The defense rested its case without presenting evidence on the issue of drug dependency. Prior to closing arguments, at the request of the trial court, the State filed an amended information that deleted the reference to a person who was not drug-dependent. Defendant was convicted of the sale of heroin. In affirming on appeal, the court held that: (1) where both the original and amended information charged defendant with the sale of heroin in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278(b) and the deletion of any reference to defendant's drug-dependency did not change the offense, defendant was not deprived of his right to fair notice of the charge; and (2) the prosecutor did not abuse his discretion by charging defendant with a violation of &sect; 21a-278(b) to obtain a harsher sentence instead of charging him under Conn.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court in the judicial district of New London (Connecticut) of larceny in the first degree, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-122(a)(2). On appeal, he argued that the trial court erred in denying his two amended motions to suppress, in admitting the testimony of an incompetent witness regarding the value of the items allegedly stolen, and in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Acting pursuant to a search warrant, two teams of police entered defendant's father's home trying to find defendant relative to outstanding charges. While looking for him, the police found and seized certain items related to a recent museum break-in. On appeal, the court noted that the State conceded that defendant had standing to raise the issues. The court agreed that defendant had shown that his subjective expectation of privacy in the basement garage of his father's home was reasonable and was an expectation that society would also recognize as reasonable. But, the court held that there was no clear error in the trial court's factual findings that one team of police officers, entering the house through a basement garage, had found in plain view the items seized before they learned that defendant, hiding in the attic of the home, had been located by the other team. A museum docent was properly allowed to testify as to the value of stolen museum artifacts; she was properly qualified and her reliance on an inventory for details about the artifacts was proper. The State met its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the artifacts exceeded $ 10,000.</SPAN></P>

A motion to suppress evidence required a constitutional adjudication, and a hearing conducted via &sect; 650 could be ex parte and was not an adversarial hearing. The court rejected the argument that the State had waived its right to an adversarial proceeding on the suppression of evidence. The court found that the trial court had not told the State that it was making the probable-cause hearing into a suppression hearing. On a separate jurisdictional issue, the court rejected the contention that the State had failed to comply with Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 54-96.</SPAN></P>

The inclusion of defendant's photograph in two arrays viewed eight days apart was not impermissibly suggestive. Police did not visually, verbally, or demonstratively emphasize defendant's photograph. The trial court properly did not reach the reliability of the identification procedure. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing an officer to testify about the comparative reliability of crime victims' identifications because it was opinion testimony based on her professional experience. Defendant's failure to object to the State's further questioning of the officer did not preserve any alleged error for review and defendant's point of error was not of constitutional proportion to merit review of the unpreserved claim. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's requested charge on the reliability of eyewitness identifications because the trial court's instructions adequately covered the dangers of misidentification.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that the trial court's failure to compel the State to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for its peremptory challenge of a black venire person violated his rights to equal protection and an impartial jury under U.S. Const. amend. VI, XI ,and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect;&sect; 8, 20. The court conducted a Batson inquiry to determine whether the trial court could reasonably conclude that defendant failed to make a prima facie showing of discriminatory abuse of the challenge. The State conducted voir dire of nine panelists before questioning a black venire person, who was asked the same questions as other venire persons but gave equivocal or confused answers. While the first Batson factor was satisfied, i.e., the defendant was black and the State exercised a peremptory challenge to remove a him, the record did not support a reasonable inference that the State exercised the challenge for a racially discriminatory purpose. Defendant's claim that the jury charge on reasonable doubt was overly beneficial to the State was not reviewed because defendant's trial objection was imprecise and because the claim the claim was not of constitutional proportion.</SPAN></P>

The court held that first and second degree sexual assault were separate crimes for which defendant could be prosecuted and punished without violating the prohibition against double jeopardy. Defendant did not show that the legislature intended that sexual assault in the first degree and sexual assault in the second degree be two crimes, nominally distinct for which only one penalty could be imposed. The trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress pornographic materials seized when executing a search warrant for a knife where the materials, found in a drawer in a night table next to defendant's bed, were discovered inadvertently during a legal search. The seizure was lawful under the plain view doctrine because the police did not know that pornographic material was in the night table and went there intending to seize it, using the search warrant for the knife as a subterfuge, and the material was relevant to the charge of injury or risk of injury to a child.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that the trial court erred in permitting a key defense witness to assert his fifth amendment privilege in the presence of the jury and in prohibiting defendant from calling certain expert witnesses to testify that defendant did not fit the profile of a pedophile. The state had questioned a defense witness on his perception ability and the use of marijuana. The witness asserted the fifth amendment privilege with regard to answering any questions on his marijuana use. The court affirmed defendant's conviction holding that defendant's contention of error did not present any constitutional issues, because defendant claimed no violation of his own constitutional rights, and defendant had no standing to assert the constitutional rights of the witness. The court further found no error in the trial court's refusal to admit testimony from defendant's experts because defendant failed to demonstrate that the witnesses had a special skill or knowledge directly applicable to a matter at issue, which was incest, that would have made their testimony informative and helpful to the jury.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed, holding that: (1) the police legally detained defendant on a reasonable suspicion that he was driving under the influence; (2) the roadside sobriety test, which did not involve long delay or unreasonable intrusion, was justified by that reasonable suspicion; (3) the expert testimony of the officer who administered the field sobriety test was not inadmissible as an opinion regarding an issue of ultimate fact because it was based in great part on knowledge and skill beyond the ken of the average juror and was helpful to the jury; (4) the lay opinion testimony of the officer in the hotel lobby was admissible because it was limited to the issue of intoxication; and (5) the reasonable doubt instruction was proper.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court in the judicial district of New Haven (Connecticut) of receiving cash contributions, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 9-348k(9), 9-348l (1983), and one count of larceny in the third degree, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-124(a)(1), 53a-121, 53a-119(1).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As defendant, representing an incumbent mayor up for reelection, returned contributions to contributors because they had been ruled improper, he requested cash or checks payable to cash in return. On appeal, the court noted that Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 9-335(14), (15) were not very clear and the expert's testimony was properly allowed as an aid for the jury. His clarification of the difference between an expenditure and a contribution was not an ultimate issue. The court held that the jury was correctly instructed on the State's burden of proof. A tape recording of a conversation between defendant and an inspector from the State's Attorney's office was properly admitted. The recording was not hearsay, it did not violate defendant's constitutional rights, and it was relevant. The court held that the legislative history of &sect; 9-348k(9) made it clear that checks were intended to be included within the ambit of a &quot;cash contribution&quot; as the term was used in &sect; 9-348k(9). The court held that the denial of defendant's motion for a continuance was not error. Counsel had time to prepare a defense and no claim was made that the lack of a continuance substantially impaired his effectiveness.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was charged with robbery, and the trial court charged the jury by stating the information accused defendant of committing the crime in one or two ways: by use or threatened use of a dangerous instrument and by the use of force for overcoming resistance in the taking of property. Defendant was convicted of robbery in the first degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-133(1), 53a-134(a)(3). Defendant appealed and contended that the trial court's instruction permitted the jury to convict him of robbery in the third degree instead of robbery in the first degree because the jury was not required to find that he used a dangerous weapon. The court set aside the conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court held that the trial court improperly informed the jury that it could convict defendant on the basis of two theories, only one of which involved the use of a dangerous weapon, and there was a possibility that the state was able to gain a conviction without having to prove one of the elements of the crime charged.</SPAN></P>

The trial court expressly found that the officers were aware of various facts that satisfied the &quot;reasonable and articulable suspicion&quot; standard necessary to justify a Terry stop. The officers were sent to an area known for frequent narcotics sales on the basis of information that drug sales were occurring. The officers observed defendant discard a paper bag and, from their training and experience, had reason to believe the bag contained drugs. Each of these circumstances had been held to be a valid basis for assessing the reasonableness of police action. The court concluded that the facts were sufficient to justify the investigative stop. The police had probable cause to make the arrest having found what appeared to be narcotics in a bag tossed away by defendant.

The alleged father had the opportunity to litigate the issue of paternity, but chose instead, to stipulate to a judgment that was approved by the trial court.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a public housing association and some of its members, appealed the decision of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Ansonia-Milford (Connecticut), which denied plaintiffs' request for the payment of alleged overcharges against defendant housing authority pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-72a (Rev. to 1983), although it granted plaintiffs' request to enjoin eviction proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After some members of the association received eviction notices from the housing authority, plaintiffs filed suit on grounds that the housing authority arbitrarily set the maximum allowable income limits for residence in the moderate income housing project in violation of &sect; 8-72a and sought refunds for overcharges. The trial court enjoined the eviction proceedings after the undisputed evidence showed that the housing authority did not consider the average wage for the surrounding town in its computation of the maximum income limits as required by &sect; 8-72a, but rejected plaintiffs' claim for an accounting. On appeal of the latter ruling, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the trial court erred because even though plaintiffs were not entitled to an accounting in its strict sense, their complaint and the evidence clearly showed that they merely sought a computation of the amount of the overcharges in aid of their claim for damages in light of the complicated formula that the housing authority was required to prepare under &sect; 8-72a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court, which had denied plaintiffs' request for an accounting in aid of their claim against the housing authority for a refund of overcharges paid.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the attorney made many claims of error, none of which were sustained by the court. Thus, the court ruled that the attorney's challenge to the jurisdiction of the trial court on constitutional grounds was without merit; no proof of corrupt motive or evil intent was required as a prerequisite to suspending the attorney, nor was the trial court in error in failing to utilize the &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; standard of proof for suspension. Further, the attorney's statements to the social workers were not privileged under constitutional guarantees of free speech as attorneys were not exempt from the laws limiting speech that were applicable to all citizens, and the attorney failed to prove any impairment due to the hearing site.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With the permission of the Superior Court in the judicial district of Ansonia-Milford, geographical area number five (Connecticut), the State appealed that court's grant of defendants' motions to suppress certain evidence and its judgments dismissing charges of illegal possession of narcotics, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-279(a), illegal sale of drugs, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 21a-278, and interfering with an officer, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-167a.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Detectives, acting without a search warrant and without announcing that they were police officers, kicked in a door to defendants' home and secured the premises while a search warrant was being obtained. The State argued that, because the evidence had been seized after the search warrant was obtained, the inevitable discovery doctrine obviated application of the exclusionary rule. On appeal, the State asserted the independent source doctrine, another exception to the exclusionary rule. The court held that the latter claim was reviewable under the plain error doctrine, because neither the Supreme Court of Connecticut nor the court had previously had occasion to consider the independent source doctrine in the context presented. Thus, the issue was of importance to the development of the law of the state and was vital to the proper resolution of the case. But, because whether the evidence was illegally seized was, in the first instance, a factual question, which the trial court had not yet considered, and, further, because defendants had to be given a chance to challenge the validity of the search warrant, the court remanded the case to the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court remanded the case to the superior court for further proceedings in accordance with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70. On appeal, he argued, inter alia, that the trial court erred in permitting the prosecutor to make improper remarks during closing argument in violation of defendant's constitutional rights to a fair trial and due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">During the State's case-in-chief, a police officer was allowed to testify, over defendant's objection, as to defendant's failure to respond to the victim's repeated question: &quot;Why did the both of you do this to me?&quot; On appeal, the court held that the victim's statement carried sufficiently accusatory implications to call for a response. But, given the facts, the trial court erred in allowing the officer to testify that defendant remained silent in the face of the victim's accusation. Under the circumstances, that defendant remained silent was too unreliable as evidence of assent to the statement to be admissible as an admission by silence. However, the court held that its admission was harmless error. The court held that the trial court's failure to charge the jurors that they had to unanimously agree on whether defendant employed &quot;use of force&quot; or &quot;the threat of use of force&quot; did not violate his right to a unanimous verdict in a six-member jury trial. Because defendant failed to object to the prosecutor's remarks when they were made, and because the remarks did not deprive him of a fundamental constitutional right or a fair trial, the court did not review that claimed error.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no reversible error in any of the issues defendant raised.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners owned a triangular parcel of land in a residential district that was smaller than one acre. They also owned a four-acre parcel across the road from the triangular parcel. Zoning regulations adopted in 1950 provided for one-acre residential zoning, and as amended in 1970 for two-acre residential zoning. The town zoning enforcement officer found that the triangular parcel was a nonconforming lot because it had been separately owned since the zoning regulations were adopted, and he issued a building permit allowing the landowners to build on the parcel. The landowners' neighbors appealed and the zoning board reversed the enforcement officer's decision without explanation. The court held that the trial court did not err when it dismissed the landowners' appeal from the board's decision. The parcel was not owned in separate ownership when the zoning regulations were adopted, and the land records did not show the parcel as a separate lot until after the regulations were adopted and amended. Moreover, the parcel was part of the four-acre tract on the other side of the road until 1968. Accordingly, the board did not act arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion.</SPAN></P>

The trial court's deviation from the language of &sect; 54-84(b) was not the type that, in the context of the entire charge, would mislead the jurors by suggesting that it was permissible for them to consider defendant's silence in deciding the case.

In finding no error, the court ruled that the search was incident to a lawful arrest and was not limited in its scope to the evidence of the larceny. The court also ruled that, where defendant was established as the driver of the vehicle and was observed hiding something under the seat where the drugs were found, the jury could have reasonably concluded, upon the facts established and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to justify the verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The court held that the trial court's use of the word &quot;must&quot; was not an improper direction to convict, because the jury instructions, read in their entirety, did not direct or advise the jury how to decide the matter.</SPAN></P>

The officer observed what appeared to him to be a drug transaction between defendant and another man.

At no point did the officer command defendant to stop. During the chase, defendant dropped a pouch that was picked up by the pursuing officer. Upon being apprehended, defendant was arrested and the pouch was opened, revealing a quantity of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana. In affirming defendant's convictions, the court held that the pursuit of defendant did not constitute a seizure. The court held that, applying the reasonable person test, it could not be said that a reasonable person would feel that his liberty was restricted in any way.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner operated a private solid waste disposal landfill in the town pursuant to a permit from the department of environmental protection (DEP), but in violation of the town's zoning ordinance prohibiting such use of property. The court found that the trial court erred in granting the town a permanent injunction against the landowner's operation of his landfill and made the following holdings: (1) The general zoning authority granted the town by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 8-2 did not extend to the enactment of zoning regulations that conflicted with DEP permits because the Solid Waste Management Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 22a-207 through 22a-221, preempted conflicting local zoning regulations. (2) The town's ordinance was a &quot;prohibition&quot; on the business of operating a private landfill and went beyond the power of &quot;regulation&quot; conferred by &sect; 8-2. (3) The landowner was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies by appealing to the town's zoning board of appeals because the board's jurisdiction under &sect; 8-7 did not include determining the legality of zoning regulations.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the judgment granting the permanent injunction against the landowner's operation of a private landfill and charging the landowner with a penalty, costs, and attorney fees.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford (Connecticut) of burglary in the third degree, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-103 (Rev. to 1977). On appeal, he argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could convict him of burglary on the basis of his remaining unlawfully in a building where the State charged him with having committed the unlawful entry form of burglary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed the instruction unconstitutionally enlarged the burglary offense as stated in the information, thereby permitting the jury to convict him on the basis of an uncharged portion of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-103 in violation of his rights under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Conn. Const. art. I, &sect; 8. Although defendant failed to raise that claim at trial and failed to take an exception to the trial court's charge, the court reviewed the claim under State v. Evans, because it implicated his constitutional right to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation against him and because the court had granted such review for a similar claim. But the court refused to review his claim that he was prejudiced because his trial defense of a right to enter the building as a guest was insufficient to meet the enlarged offense. The record did not support that portion of his claim. The court held that defendant's theory of defense presented at trial that he never intended to commit a crime in the building was not prejudiced by the erroneous instruction. The court concluded from the verdicts that the erroneous charge manifestly did not affect the verdict, so the error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found no reversible error.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that the trial court did not violate defendants' rights of confrontation by a refusal to admit into evidence, for impeachment purposes, tape recordings of telephone conversations that involved a witness where both defendants were permitted to question the witness at length regarding his character, his habitual lying, and his strong motive for testifying for the State.</SPAN></P>

Defendant fled, police caught him, retraced his route, and found an unexploded .38 caliber bullet with a dented primer. An expert testified that the dented primer was probably caused when the gun misfired. The instant court held that the evidence was sufficient to prove defendant intended to cause the victim serious physical harm under Conn. Gen.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction, after a jury trial in the lower court (Connecticut), of carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-35 and criminal possession of a revolver in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-217.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Each of defendant's claims had recently been addressed and rejected by the court. Defendant's argued that the trial court erred in refusing to sever the criminal possession of a revolver charge, which required proof of a prior felony conviction, from the charge of carrying a pistol without a permit. The court disagreed and found that defendant failed to sustain his heavy burden of showing that the denial of his motion to sever resulted in substantial injustice or prejudice. Defendant also claimed that the trial court's failure to bifurcate, sua sponte, the trial of the criminal possession of a revolver charge for separate jury consideration of the two elements of the crime, amounted to plain error. This claim was without merit. Defendant's challenge to the constitutionality of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-217(a) was raised for the first time on appeal. Defendant's conviction of carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 29-35, and his conviction of criminal possession of a revolver in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-217(a), did not violate the protection against multiple punishments for the same offense under the Double Jeopardy Clause.</SPAN></P>

Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-125 and breach of the peace in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-181 while he was on probation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was found to be a delinquent and ordered to live at a state owned psychiatric hospital for adolescents as a condition of probation. A breach of peace charge arose when he struck a staff member. Subsequent to that incident, he was released. While he was still on probation, he was found to be in possession of stolen property. On appeal of his adjudication as a delinquent, the court affirmed. The court held that although he was charged in the petition with unlawfully taking property and adjudicated a delinquent for possession of stolen property, his defense was not prejudiced. Pursuant to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-119, proof of the receipt of stolen property was sufficient proof of larceny in the fourth degree regardless of whether respondent was charged with wrongfully taking, or obtaining, or withholding the property from the owner. Further, the trial court could reasonably have inferred a criminal connection with the property from his possession of it shortly after it was stolen. Respondent's right to cross-examine the complainant in the breach of the peace charge was not unconstitutionally restricted, as the line of questioning excluded was irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the seizure of the gun was simultaneous with defendant's arrest and the police had adequate justification. Next, defendant asserted that his statements made regarding the weapon should have been suppressed. The court decided there was no error in admitting the statements because they were made after defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his rights under Miranda. Defendant further contended that admission of another individual's statement into evidence was erroneous because it was hearsay. The court disagreed and held that there was a hearsay exception that applied and the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Defendant also argued that the jury instructions were invalid. The court determined that the jury was not misled, any error was harmless, and there was no confusion. Finally, defendant claimed that there was pervasive prosecutorial misconduct but the court noted that the remarks did not warrant reversal.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held the State's failure to prove the dates of the risk of injury did not violate his constitutional right to present a defense. The court stated defendant placed the victims in a situation likely to injure their health over a period of more than two years and the threat was continual in nature. The court also held the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions and evidentiary rulings were correct. The court ruled evidence of sexual conduct between defendant and an adult friend of the victims was admissible and the trial court properly denied a motion to suppress marihuana seized at defendant's home. The court further stated a unanimity instruction and other jury instructions correctly stated the law and the trial court did not commit errors in sentencing defendant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the denial of their motions to sever and to order separate trials and the jury instructions on drawing inferences from circumstantial evidence. The court affirmed. First, the trial court gave adequate consideration to the potential for prejudice caused by the joinder of the charges. In light of the numerous references to the second defendant's prior felony convictions and incarceration, the court could not conclude that any substantial injustice resulted from the refusal to order separate trials on the two offenses. Any prejudicial effect to the first defendant, who did not testify at trial, caused by the joinder of the two counts was minimal. His prior conviction was presented to the jury by stipulation, but the cautionary instruction was complete and emphatic. Second, despite defendants' failure to except to the charge, the claim was reviewable because the instruction was erroneous. However, it was not reasonably possible that the erroneous instruction misled the jury on the state's burden of proof on the robbery charge because the jury's verdict depended not on circumstantial evidence but upon the credit it gave to the complainant's direct testimony.</SPAN></P>

The State did not err in using defendant's pre-arrest silence to impeach the credibility of his self-defense claim. The State's comment regarding defendant's post-arrest silence were improper, but it was clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict without the impermissible questioning and impermissible comment. The pre-trial identification of defendant through a photographic line-up was proper. The record did not reveal that the trial court's demeanor or conduct denied defendant a fair trial, thus a mistrial was not warranted. While the State did make improper comments about defendant, the impropriety was not so egregious as to deny defendant a fair trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Waterbury (Connecticut), which entered a judgment of guilty against defendant on the State's charges of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70(a) and conspiracy to commit sexual assault in the first degree in violation of &sect; 53a-70(a) and of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-48(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on the elements of first degree sexual assault and that its refusal to admit evidence of the victim's prior conduct denied his Sixth Amendment rights. On appeal, the court found no reversible error. The jury instruction was an accurate statement of law because the plain language of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-70(a) imposed liability for sexual assault on anyone who compelled another to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force regardless of with whom the sexual act was performed. Likewise, evidence of the victim's prior sexual conduct was properly excluded because it did not tend to show that the victim lied about her prior experiences. Further, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting defense counsel's cross-examination of the victim about her prior rape complaint by prohibiting questions collateral to the issue of the victim's reliability, and defendant failed to show that he was prejudiced by the limitation. Finally, the Sixth Amendment was satisfied where defense counsel was allowed to question the victim about the prior complaint so as to put the issue of her reliability before the jury.</SPAN></P>

The trial court rendered judgment for the landlord and denied the victim's motion to set aside the verdict. He appealed, asserting that the trial court erred in marking an exhibit for identification after the trial, and in instructing the jury as to the landlord's duty of care. The court disagreed and affirmed. It explained that, when requested by the victim, the trial court failed to mark for identification a written statement of the landlord that was in the possession of the landlord's counsel. Posttrial the trial court acknowledged this error and marked the statement for identification. The court noted the rule that all exhibits offered had to be marked for identification, and held that the trial court should have had the proffered statement marked. But, as the statement contained nothing useful for impeachment, even had it been admissible, the victim had not been harmed by the omission. The jury charge, as to a landlord's duty to remove snow and ice within a reasonable time after a storm, was proper.</SPAN></P>

After the cross-examination of an accomplice was complete, the State, over the juvenile's objection and exception, was permitted to amend the petition of delinquency to include four additional charges, including conspiracy to commit robbery in the second degree. After the juvenile's motion to dismiss the four additional counts was denied, the juvenile entered a plea of nolo contendere to a reduced charge of conspiracy to commit robbery in the second degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect;&sect; 53a-48 and 53-136. The juvenile was then adjudicated a delinquent child. On appeal, the court found that the midtrial amendments, which were allowed by Conn. Gen. Prac. Book &sect; 1029, did not violate the juvenile's constitutional right in terms of adequate and timely notice of the charges against him because the amendments could not have come as a complete surprise because pretrial discovery established that there was enough evidence therein on which to base a conspiracy charge.

Whether the grounds for termination existed for not less than one year, as required by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 17-43a(b), was a question of fact. The child's mother suffered from a long history of mental illness, diagnosed as chronic schizophrenia, undifferentiated. Her prognosis was poor and the child would clearly have been at risk if placed in her care. Visits between the mother and child failed to establish a positive bond. The child had no emotional ties to the mother and had developed a warm and loving relationship with her foster parents.

The court held that in order to prove a larceny, the state had to prove that defendant intentionally took possession of a television set that was offered for sale and that defendant did not pay the purchase price of the television. The state presented no direct evidence on either of these points. Defendant admitted being in the store. There was no direct evidence that a television set was purchased that evening, nor was there any direct evidence that the television set carton that was observed outside next to defendant contained a TV set or was from the victim. This was not a case where circumstantial evidence was used to bolster the direct evidence; rather, it was a case in which circumstantial evidence was used to prove essential elements of the crime charged.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New Haven, Geographical Area Number Six (Connecticut) of robbery in the third degree, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-136, and larceny in the second degree, Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-123.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although a robber had a nylon stocking over his face, the victim was able to give the police a description of his age, height, race, build, facial features, and clothing. Three days later, after viewing numerous persons in the parking lot at defendant's place of employment, including about seven white males, the victim identified defendant, a white male, as the robber. On appeal, the court held that the identification procedure was not impermissibly suggestive. Therefore, the denial of defendant's motion to suppress the victim's in-court and out-of-court identifications was proper. The jury charge on the issue of identity was balanced as to the respective functions of the judge and the jury and it did not direct or advise the jury on how to decide the matter. No injustice was done to defendant. Although the charge on circumstantial evidence was error, considering the overall charge and its likely effect on the jury, it was not reasonably possible that the jury was misled, so the error was not reversible. Defendant's convictions for larceny in the second degree and robbery in the third degree did not violate his double jeopardy rights, and the separate sentences imposed were proper.</SPAN></P>

Second, the court did not err in giving a Ledbetter jury instruction, because the officer had a good look at defendant when he threatened the officer at the scene and the officer was able to provide a good description. Third, the trial court's instructions on the presumption of innocence were sufficient and defendant was not deprived of a fair trial thereby.

On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the borrower received due process of law because he was given a full hearing. The court also held that the trial court properly awarded fees and expenses for the aborted sales under &sect; 49-25 because the use of the phrase &quot;of such sale&quot; did not require confirmation by the trial court of the sale as a condition precedent to the allowance of costs and fees.</SPAN></P>

The insurance company appealed a decision from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Stamford-Norwalk (Connecticut), which rendered judgment in accordance with the court-appointed arbitrator's findings in favor of plaintiff, and denied its motions for a trial de novo and to reopen the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court referred the action to an arbitrator, but neither the insurer nor its counsel appeared. The trial court adopted the arbitrator's decision, and the sole issue presented was whether the right of the insurer to trial by jury under the Connecticut Constitution was violated. The court affirmed and held that the right was not violated. A party who challenged a statute on constitutional grounds had no easy burden; every intendment would be made in favor of constitutionality, and invalidity had to be established beyond a reasonable doubt. The right to a jury trial could be subjected to reasonable conditions, and provision by the legislature for an alternative means of dispute resolution through the use of arbitrators to hear cases claimed for jury trial was part of an effort to alleviate court congestion. The right to a trial by jury in such cases was preserved inviolate by Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 52-549z and Conn. Gen. Prac. Book, R. Super. Ct. &sect; 546S; however, only a party who had appeared at the hearing could claim a trial de novo. The insurer did not attend the hearing before the arbitrator, and the objection to its motion for trial de novo was properly sustained.</SPAN></P>

The court addressed defendant's concerns and instructed him to discuss his concerns further with his attorney, and was advised that he could get a new lawyer only if he retained private counsel. Following a recess, the trial resumed, at which time the assistant public defender orally moved that alternate counsel be appointed to represent defendant, on the basis of defendant's earlier complaint and on counsel's own representation of a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship. After a brief colloquy, the court denied the motion. The trial continued, and defendant was found guilty. The court held that the trial judge's failure to inquire into defendant's request for new counsel, where defendant had already made known the reasons for his request, was not error. It was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to have refused to appoint alternate counsel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Tolland, Geographical Area Number Nineteen (Connecticut), which denied his amended motion to suppress two breathalyzer tests upon entry of a plea of nolo contendere to the charge of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227a(a).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the results of the breathalyzer tests were inadmissible on the grounds that his consent to the tests, after being warned of the possible loss of his license if he refused to take the tests, did not constitute the voluntary consent to a search required by U.S. Const. amend. IV. The court rejected defendant's contention, finding that defendant chose to engage in a regulated activity, that of driving a motor vehicle, and thereby became subject to Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 14-227b. Further, the court found that the choice between consent to a breathalyzer test or refusal with the possible loss of license did not vitiate consent if no force, deception, or coercion was used or threatened. The court determined that the denial of defendant's motion was warranted whether the denial was analyzed in terms of statutory implied consent or in terms of the reasonableness of the search in view of exigent circumstances. Thus, the court concluded that the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress because there was no unreasonable search.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 15-144(h) after a boat patrol officer observed their vessels docked in Connecticut waters for more than 60 days. Defendants appealed. In affirming, the appellate court ruled that credibility of witnesses was for the trier of fact and the evidence was sufficient to find the vessels were in Connecticut waters for the requisite number of days. There was no authority for defendants' claims that their Sixth Amendment rights to cross-examination had been violated and the court declined to consider their argument that the statutory scheme violated the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, because there was no evidence that their vessels were engaged in interstate commerce. Payment of a use tax was not necessarily a precondition to registration and defendants' claims that the use tax was tonnage duty, in violation of U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim testified at trial that he received the iron burn as an accident. However, the victim had previously told police that defendant burned him to punish him for a mini bike accident. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred in its charge to the jury on the offense of risk of injury to a minor. In a bill of particulars, the state specified that defendant was charged only with committing an act directly on the minor that was injurious to his moral or physical well-being. However, the jury instructions referred to another alternative under the statute that dealt with willfully or unlawfully permitting a child to have been placed in a situation where it's life or limb was in danger. Defendant's defense was directed to the specific act alleged in the bill of particulars. The evidence which defendant might have offered had he been charged with the entire risk of injury statute, however, would logically have differed from that which he did present to defend against the portion of the statute with which he was charged. The court concluded that defendant met his burden of proving that he was prejudiced in the presentation of his defense by the trial court's charge to the jury.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed as to the simple trespass charge and affirmed as to the public disturbance charge. The court held that defendant was a business invitee that was not required to make a purchase. The court found that in the absence of evidence that defendant knowingly entered as a trespasser, there could be no trespass unless the possessor revoked the business invitee status.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of robbery in the first degree, a violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-134. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in not charging the jury properly and in failing to suppress several out-of-court and in-court identifications. The court upheld defendant's conviction. The court ruled that the charge given by the trial court involving specific intent was specifically requested by defendant. The section of the charge defendant claimed was erroneous was precisely what he requested; therefore he was not entitled to review. The court held that photographic identifications by the State's witnesses were not impremissively suggestive. The identification of defendant by one of the witnesses was unexpected. The procedure used by the police accidentally aided in defendant's identification. The court concluded that the photographic array was reliable and supported by sufficient evidence. All the witnesses' had the opportunity to get a view of defendant and all three witnesses' description matched.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Fairfield (Connecticut), which convicted her upon a jury verdict of manslaughter in the second degree in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-56.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's husband attempted to take a gun from defendant during a domestic dispute. The gun fired and fatally wounded the husband. Defendant claimed that the trial court's instruction on circumstantial evidence was erroneous. The court remanded the action for a new trial, finding error in the trial court's jury instruction. Because defendant's state of mind was the principal disputed issue in the instant case, the court concluded that the trial court's charge was subject to the court's close scrutiny. The court held that the charge impermissibly diluted the State's burden of proof at trial because it informed the jurors that an inferred fact could be drawn from a proven fact if the jurors found that such proven fact made it more probable than not that the fact to be inferred from the evidence was true. The court rejected defendant's claim that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that she caused her husband's death. The court could not find as a matter of law that the decedent's conduct constituted a sufficient intervening cause of his own demise so as to break the chain of causation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the decision of the Superior Court in the Judicial District of Ansonia-Milford (Connecticut), which denied defendant's motion to suppress the blood-alcohol test results of two blood samples and one urine sample and convicted defendant of two counts of misconduct with a motor vehicle in violation of Conn. Gen. Stat. &sect; 53a-57.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant crashed his car while driving under the influence of alcohol. Two passengers died in the crash. Defendant consented to the hospital's release of a blood-alcohol test and consented to a blood-alcohol and urine test performed by the police. The State later charged defendant with two counts of manslaughter in the second degree. The trial court denied defendant's motion to suppress the test results, which showed that he was drunk, and instructed the jury on misconduct with a motor vehicle in violation of &sect; 53a-57 as a lesser included offense. The jury convicted on the lesser included offense. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that the blood and urine test results were properly admitted, even though defendant was not under arrest at the time they were taken, because he gave consent. However, the court held that misconduct with a motor vehicle was not a lesser included offense to manslaughter in the second degree because conviction of misconduct with a motor vehicle required proof of the mental state involved in criminal negligence, which was not an element of manslaughter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ditched two of the victim's friends, drove the victim to the woods on a pretense, and forcibly raped her before driving her to her friend's house. Defendant was convicted of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of &sect; 53a-70. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 53a-70(a) was not void for vagueness because a person of ordinary intelligence could understand what a &quot;threat of the use of force&quot; meant and because defendant failed to show any spatial or temporal disjunction that could have truncated his use of force from the ensuing sexual intercourse. The court also held that the trial court properly denied defendant's requested instruction on consent or resistance because the State did not have to show that defendant had to &quot;overcome earnest resistance&quot; as an element of the crime. The court also held that the trial court properly admitted evidence of spermatozoa and properly summarized the evidence during the charge because it also properly instructed the jury that it was its duty to assess the credibility of witnesses, weigh the evidence, and determine the facts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant company sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court in the Judicial District of New London (Connecticut), which granted appellee city's request for an injunction enjoining the company from using its premises, on which was located a cement manufacturing operation, as a trucking terminal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city claimed that the company was required to obtain site plan approval from the commission on the city plan before using its premises as a trucking terminal. The court affirmed the judgment, rejecting the company's contention that the trial court erred in concluding that site plan approval was required for the addition of truck storage use. The trial court concluded that the use of the company's premises as a trucking terminal was an increase in a preexisting permitted use, and it interpreted the city's zoning ordinances to require site plan approval whenever there was an increase in a permitted use of property. The court, however, determined that the company added a different permitted use to the previously permitted use on its property. The court held that the addition of a different permitted use required site plan approval to determine the effect of the use on the surrounding area. The court interpreted Norwich, Conn., Code &sect; 10.2.2 to mean that each and every use in the heavy industrial district must be approved by the commission.</SPAN></P>
