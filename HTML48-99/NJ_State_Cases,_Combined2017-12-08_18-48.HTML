</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff customer filed a product liability suit against a corporation. After plaintiff realized that the corporation did not manufacture the item, she sued defendant manufacturer. Defendant earned a dismissal of the suit on the grounds that the action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations. Plaintiff moved to reinstate the suit based on a recently decided decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, which permitted the tolling of the statute of limitations, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-22, for suits instituted before a certain date, including plaintiff's. The reviewing court found that the motion was improperly denied. The trial judge should have considered the original dismissal to be a mistake. Plaintiff's application to the trial court was timely, so the denial of the reinstatement of the complaint was a mistaken exercise of discretion under N.J. Ct. R. 4:50-1(a).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The denial of plaintiff customer's request for reinstatement and restoration to the trial list of her product liability complaint against defendant manufacturer was reversed and remanded because the statute of limitations was tolled pursuant to a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States.</SPAN></P>

However, defendant refused to take a breathalyzer test. At trial, defendant was acquitted of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol but convicted of refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction for refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test. The court noted that defendant had refused to take the test and that the elements of the offense as provided by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-50.4a were established in the state's proofs. However, the court ruled that that an additional element of the offense, operation in fact, was not proven. The court held that without his express or implied consent, defendant had no obligation to submit to a breathalyzer test and was not subject to &sect; 39:4-50.4a or its sanctions, including driver's license suspension. The court found that defendant did not give his express consent and that because he was not the operator of the vehicle, he had not given his complied consent as well.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Attorney general challenged the decision of the Superior Court, Law Division, Bergen County (New Jersey), which declared that 1982 N.J. Laws 220 as amended by 1983 N.J. Laws 55, N.J. Stat. Ann. 54:4-23a, was unconstitutional because it exempted newly constructed residential structures from taxation until occupancy, and, thus violated N.J. Const. art. VIII (1947). Attorney general contended the law was general, not special, legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, attorney general contended that the trial court erred in declaring that 1982 N.J. Laws 220 as amended by 1983 N.J. Laws 55, N.J. Stat. Ann. 54:4-23a was unconstitutional. The court agreed and reversed the trial court's decision. The legislation was constitutional because it was general, rather than special, in application. Applying a three part test, the court held that the legislation was designed to reduce the cost of housing; that it was not invalid merely because there may be some discriminatory impact and some imperfections; and, that there was a rational basis to support the exclusion of residential rental units. Therefore, plaintiff taxpayers failed to carry the burden of clearly demonstrating a violation of N.J. Const. art. VIII (1947).</SPAN></P>

Therefore, it was not unconstitutional &quot;special&quot; legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Numerous senators sponsored and introduced a proposed amendment to N.J. Const. art. V, &sect; 4, par. 6. The resolution set forth the form of the question on the ballot and an interpretive statement to appear on the ballot. The resolution was adopted in the Senate and the General Assembly. The following year, the legislature decided to place the resolution on the ballot during the 1985 general election. Respondent secretary of state decided that she would place the proposed amendment on the ballot unless otherwise instructed by the courts. Appellant attorney general sought an injunction barring respondent from placing the issue on the ballot, arguing that the proposed amendment was too ambiguous. The court denied appellant's request for an injunction. However, the court invalidated the interpretive statement included with the proposed amendment, on the ground that it was highly misleading, and remanded to the legislature for preparation of a new interpretive statement.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:21-19.1(a)(3), by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Morris County, on the grounds that &sect; 24:21-19.1(a)(3) was unconstitutional and that the trial court improperly refused to admit the physician's desk reference into evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested after officers found a plastic bag containing 200 white capsules on his person. Due to their size and shape, the officers believed the capsules contained a controlled substance. Defendant gave a statement that he believed the pills to be &quot;speed&quot; and that he had intended to sell them. A lab test revealed that the pills contained caffeine, and defendant was charged with and convicted of possession of a &quot;look-alike&quot; drug with intent to distribute under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:21-19.1(a)(3). The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that &sect; 24:21-19.1(a)(3) was not unconstitutionally vague because persons of ordinary intelligence would understand what conduct the statute proscribed. Defendant's conviction precluded him from complaining of the vagueness of &sect; 24:21-19.1(a)(3) as applied to his own conduct. Section 24:21-19.1(a)(3) was not overbroad because it did not reach any constitutionally protected conduct. The statutory presumption was reasonable. The trial court's ruling as to the physician's desk reference was harmless error because the refusal to admit the book did not create a potential for prejudice or injustice.</SPAN></P>

The statute read that the credit was to apply against &quot;such annual charge.&quot; Appellant was obligated to pay an &quot;annual service charge.&quot; The court held that that the reference to &quot;such&quot; annual charge, which referred collaterally to real estate taxes, was forcefully and directly concerned with the annual service charge, and that it could only have meant the annual service charge. The court further held that the distinction between &quot;annual service charge&quot; and &quot;annual charge,&quot; considered in the context of the whole body of law was too thin a reed to thwart the obvious public purpose inherent in the statute.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to a referendum held pursuant to 1984 N.J. Laws 160 (chapter 160), an amendment and supplement to the Sunday Closing Law, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:171-5.8 to -5.18, plaintiff resident, plaintiff developer, plaintiff retailer, and plaintiff organization, among others, filed suit against defendant clerk and defendant attorney general. Plaintiffs contended chapter 160 was unconstitutional special legislation that violated constitutional guarantees of equal protection. Based upon their contention that a fundamental right was involved, plaintiffs argued chapter 160 was subject to strict scrutiny and had to serve a compelling state interest in order to be sustainable. The trial court applied the test of minimal scrutiny and upheld the validity of chapter 160. Consequently, plaintiffs sought review, again asserting that strict scrutiny was necessary. On review, the court affirmed, finding minimal scrutiny was sufficient, because chapter 160 did not indirectly affect a fundamental right in a substantial enough way to require even intermediate scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order upholding the act because the act concerned the right to vote in a referendum, which was only statutory, not constitutional, and the act did not indirectly affect a fundamental right in a substantial enough way to require more than minimal scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

Appellants challenged the 20% net fill rule, N.J. Admin. Code tit. 7 &sect; 13-4.7(d), the creation of a category of Projects of Special Concern, N.J. Admin. Code tit. 7 &sect; 13-5.1, et seq. and the so-called grandfather clause, N.J. Admin. Code tit. 7 &sect; 13-1.4(d). The court found that appellants' allegations that respondent failed to provide the public with technical justification for the 20% net fill rule was without merit. The court held that the 20% net fill rule was neither arbitrary nor factually unsupported and did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of property without just compensation. The court rejected appellants' argument that respondent did not have statutory authority to formulate criteria for Projects of Special Concern because N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:1D-1, et seq., accorded respondent broad powers of conservation and ecological control.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owners brought an action to have 1984 N.J. Laws 67 (statute) declared unconstitutional because it permitted defendants, city and officials, to defer implementation of a revaluation of real property for the 1984 tax year. The trial court ruled the statute was unconstitutional. On review, the court found that, although there was litigation in which defendant city had been ordered to undertake a complete revaluation, it did not bar the legislature from enacting the statute because the suit involved a public right. The court also found the statute was not special legislation, in violation of N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, par. 9(6), because the peculiar and profound disturbance of real estate values that resulted from the adoption of the casino referendum provided a rational basis for the legislature to deal separately with defendant city. The court ruled the statute did not unconstitutionally delegate authority to the state treasurer by allowing him to extend the temporary moratorium for the 1985 tax year if it was in defendant's best interest. The court held, given the complexity of the revaluation a more precise standard was unrealistic, and reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The continued participation of appellants in the casino industry created an unacceptable risk of corruption. The court found that U.S. Const. amend.

On appeal, the court examined the statute, and first held that there were no specific standards governing the use of discretion by boards of education in resolving whether to pay additional sick leave. The court found that because no formal guidelines had been adopted by respondent, and respondent had indeed considered the individual characteristics of each case, including length of service, imminence of retirement, nature of the sickness or injury, that merely denying the appellants' applications did not amount to blanket denial per se, and affirmed the decisions of respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed respondent regional school district board's decision denying applications of appellant individual school employees, holding that denial of appellants' cases did not per se establish a blanket policy of denial of sick leave petitions, and that respondent had statutory discretion to review each case on its merits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff township residents brought an action for negligence against defendant township after defendant's landfill contaminated plaintiffs' well water. The trial court awarded plaintiffs damages for emotional distress, loss of quality of life, and the cost of medical surveillance to guard against plaintiffs' increased risk of developing cancer. On appeal, the court affirmed the award for loss of quality of life and vacated that portion of the award that granted recovery for emotional distress and medical surveillance. The court held that the award for emotional distress was an award for pain and suffering and that defendant was immune from liability pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 59:9-2(d). The court held that the evidence was insufficient to prove that defendant's negligence had so significantly increased the reasonable probability that any of plaintiffs would develop cancer as to justify an award for the costs of a lifetime of medical surveillance. The court further held that the award for loss of quality of life did not represent compensation for pain and suffering but rather was compensation for damages characterized by inconvenience and disruption of daily activities.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Borough of Paramus and Borough of Midland Park, sought review of summary judgments from the Superior Court, Bergen County (New Jersey), which invalidated municipal ordinances that prohibited virtually all commercial activities on Sunday. The trial court held that these ordinances were ultra vires, because their subject matter was preempted by the Code of Criminal Justice, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:1-5(d).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Code of Criminal Justice (code), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:1-5(d), prohibited the local governmental units of New Jersey from enacting or enforcing any ordinance or other local law or regulation conflicting with, or preempted by, any provision of the code or with any policy of New Jersey expressed by the code, whether that policy was expressed by inclusion of a provision in the code or by exclusion of that subject from the code. These consolidated cases implicated the validity of municipal ordinances adopted by appellants, Borough of Paramus and Borough of Midland Park, curtailing commercial activities on Sundays. The court held that the code, by saving the Chapter 119 county option for the applicability of limited Sunday closing provisions prohibiting the sale of certain merchandise, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:171-5.8 et seq., from repeal, repealing the balance of the Sunday closing sections, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:171-1, 2, 4, 5, and 6-12, and failing to include any municipal option to expand upon this expressed state policy, preempted concurrent municipal regulation in this field. Thus, appellants were without authority to adopt the ordinances, which therefore were invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner, who was convicted of manslaughter, atrocious assault and battery, assault with the intent to kill and committing the crimes while armed, sought review of his sentence from the Superior Court of New Jersey.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner contended that the trial court erred in re-sentencing him because the trial court imposed more than the 17 year maximum which he was sentenced to in the first sentencing hearing. The court noted that appellant was in a &quot;transitional&quot; class of offenders who could choose whether to be sentenced under Title 2A or Title 2C pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:1-1(c)(2). The court stated that appellant was fully warned by the sentencing judge, that resentencing would restore the Title 2A convictions as they existed before sentencing, except that the conviction for atrocious assault and battery would still be merged into the assault to kill conviction and that count four for being armed would be restored, which would expose appellant to an enhanced sentence for having committed an assault with intent to kill while armed. The court stated that vacation of the second sentence would be anomalous because appellant chose to be sentenced under Title 2A knowing of his exposure to a greater maximum term under 2A but equally aware that he would probably serve less real time because of the earlier parole date.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner's sentence was affirmed. Appellant was fully informed at resentencing that if he chose to be sentenced under a certain law he would have been exposed to a greater maximum term but probably serve less time due to an earlier parole date. Therefore, appellant could not claim that his second sentence was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant township challenged the judgment finding that its ordinance imposing a licensing fee on vending machines was invalid, in the class action of respondents, vending machine owners and operators, challenging the ordinance's validity. The lower court found the fee unreasonable and arbitrary. The court affirmed the judgment in part, findng that appellant's licensing power was granted under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:52-1(d), (g), and 52-2. Section 52-2 permitted license fees enacted pursuant to &sect; 52-1(d), (g) to be imposed for revenue.

Appellant's total cost of regulation of any one machine under the ordinance totaled $ 6.93, and appellant set the license fee at $ 40. The court held that, under &sect; 52-2, appellant's fee of $ 40 was six times the proven regulatory costs and was thus unreasonable and arbitrary.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of the lower court's suppression of evidence obtained from respondent's barbershop pursuant to a search warrant. The state claimed that the property was seized in good faith reliance on the warrant, and that it was harmless error that the description on the warrant was incorrect because the warrant application supported the description of the property to be seized. The court determined that United States Supreme Court decisions dealing with whether officers reasonably believed the search they conducted was authorized by a valid warrant would apply retroactively because there was no bar to retroactive application when it was determined that police action was constitutional. The court found the affidavit correctly set forth the items to be seized, that the judge signing the warrant had performed the factual scrutiny necessary that probable cause existed, and that the officer's good faith reliance that the warrant authorized the requested search, even though the items described in the actual warrant were incorrect, was objectively reasonable.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Hackensack Meadowlands Reclamation and Development Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 13:17-1 et seq., featured the establishment of an &quot;intermunicipal account&quot; to adjust among the constituent municipalities the losses and benefits accruing from the development of a meadowlands district. Previously, the Act's scheme was held to be constitutional against an attack that it was arbitrary. Mounting another constitutional challenge, appellant township contended that the Act required it to pay more than its fair share into the account. Essentially, appellant asserted that the Act failed to make timely adjustments for reductions in the aggregate assessed value because the Act did not account for assessment modifications in the tax court. The trial court entered summary judgment against appellant, which sought review. The court affirmed, holding that, because appellant was a municipality, it did not have standing to raise equal protection arguments against the state. Moreover, even if appellant had standing, it failed to support its equal protection argument with any evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tenants appealed an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Hudson County, which interpreted the Senior Citizens and Disabled Protected Tenancy Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:18-61.22 et seq., only partly in their favor. Plaintiff landlord cross-appealed, asserting that the act impaired existing contracts, in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, and N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, par. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landlord converted an apartment complex to condomiums. Two months later, the Senior Citizens and Disabled Protected Tenancy Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:18-61.22 et seq., was enacted with retroactive effect, granting protected status against removal to defendant tenants. Plaintiff brought an action to require defendants to vacate the premises but the trial court found for defendants, except on one point. Defendants appealed and plaintiff cross-appealed. The court found that the Act did not impermissibly impair existing contracts in violation of U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, or N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, par. 3. The state had a long history of regulating the housing industry and the remedial purpose of protecting elderly citizens constituted an appropriate governmental objective. The court also found that no taking had been committed simply because plaintiff was prevented from obtaining maximum profit. The court affirmed the trial court's enforcement of the Act against plaintiff but reversed the portion regarding defendants' applications under the Act, finding that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:18-61.24c only included their net, rather than gross, business income.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of defendant tenants on the action by plaintiff landlord to have them vacate their apartments so that condominiums could be sold, finding that the Senior Citizens and Disabled Protected Tenancy Act was constitutional in granting defendants a 40-year stay. The court reversed the judgment allowing consideration of defendants' gross business income in their applications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of three first-degree robberies of two attendants at a gasoline station, and was sentenced to three concurrent 15-year custodial terms with five years of parole ineligibility. Defendant, who was black, was tried to an all-white jury, comprised of six males and six females. During the jury selection, nine black potential jurors were seated in the jury box at different times. Two of them were excused for cause. The assistant prosecutor used peremptory challenges to excuse the remaining seven black prospective jurors. The court reversed, holding that peremptory challenges could only be used to eliminate prospective jurors based on a bias which related to the case on trial, the parties, attorneys or witnesses in the case, and that N.J. Const. art. I, paras. 5, 9, 10 proscribed the use of peremptory challenges to exclude prospective jurors solely by virtue of their membership in a cognizable group. The court found the assistant prosecutor's reasons for his preemptory challenges were sham excuses belatedly contrived to avoid admitting acts of group discrimination against all the black prospective jurors.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed, holding that defendant was denied his right to a fair and impartial trial.

Defendant landfill notified its customers that it would reach capacity and would close. Plaintiff filed a verified complaint to enjoin the closure and restricted use of defendant landfill. On appeal, the court affirmed the order, holding that by approving the new 16-foot vertical lift that would extend capacity of defendant landfill, the trial court ordered defendant landfill to accept new waste beyond its previously-determined environmentally-sound and lawful disposal capacity, but only to assure local health concerns, not to enhance provincial economic interests. The court also found that the order did not violate U.S. Const. Art. I, &sect; 8, because it barred all trash from the emergently affected area and therefore it was not based on origin alone. Lastly, the court found that the trial court's order was narrowly tailored in duration, location, and neutrality of preclusion to meet the emergency needs of the citizens until new waste disposal sites could be established.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his conviction. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the application of &sect; 2C:4-2 did not violate defendant's substantive and procedural due process rights and was properly applied at defendant's trial because the prosecution was required to establish the requisite state of defendant's criminal culpability beyond a reasonable doubt after the defense was raised.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the state of New Jersey, challenged the dismissal of the charge against defendant of possession of a weapon having previously been convicted of a crime in violation of N.

There clearly was a rational nexus between the statute and a valid legislative purpose. The court held that &sect; 2C: 39-7 was not overly broad. Further, the court found that &sect; 2C: 39-7 was sufficiently precise in its language to apprise the citizenry of the conduct proscribed. The statute provided fair notice of the activities prohibited and did not constitute a trap for a person of ordinary intelligence acting in good faith. Accordingly, the court reversed the order granting defendant's motion to dismiss and remanded for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a motion for dismissal of the count of the indictment charging him with distribution of more than one ounce of cocaine, of which at least 3.5 grams were pure freebase cocaine. At issue was his claim that the classification of cocaine as a Schedule II narcotic under the New Jersey Controlled Dangerous Substances Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24: 21-1 et seq. violated his constitutional rights of equal protection and due process. The court found that although biologically a narcotic was a drug derived from the opium poppy and cocaine was not biologically a narcotic, its classification as such for purposes of regulation and penalty was not a constitutional violation, because it posed serious problems for the community and had a high potential for abuse. The court determined that the state statute was not unconstitutionally vague, because its definition of a &quot;pure free base&quot; drug apprised defendant that his particular conduct was unlawful. In affirming the denial of the motion to dismiss, the court held that the classification of cocaine as a Schedule II narcotic was constitutionally sound.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court committed appellant psychiatric patients for treatment on applications that appellants asserted were filed after the period allowed by statute. Their cases were consolidated for appeal after they were released from hospitalization, and the court affirmed. The court found that the 20-day period within which N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:4-38 required a hearing to be held on a commitment application ran from the end of the statutory post-entry observation period, not from the date appellants physically entered the hospital. The court found that the period appellants were hospitalized before their hearing did not deprive them of their constitutional rights. The court held that, absent constitutional violation, it was proper to hear the late applications to commit appellants and, provided the applications were otherwise facially valid, it was proper to schedule them for prompt hearings. The court ruled that minor time delays did not require the trial court to dismiss the applications where two physicians said appellants would be a danger to themselves or others outside of the hospital. The interests of appellants and of the community outweighed the benefit of penalizing delays.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' overweight trucks were registered in Pennsylvania, but not in New Jersey. Defendants challenged the lower court's judgments of conviction, contending that their vehicles were not subject to axle weight limitations because under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-84.1, the legislature had intended only to regulate the axle weights of vehicles registered in New Jersey. The court affirmed the judgments of conviction. It held that there was no reason to exempt out-of-state vehicles from the axle weight limitations. The purpose of the weight limitations was to protect the highways from damage from overweight vehicles, and defendants' argument would frustrate that purpose. Further, to use Pennsylvania solid waste vehicles in New Jersey and take benefit of a statutory exception, defendants would be required to obtain dual registrations and pay fees to both jurisdictions. The court finally found that the burden created by the state's axle weight limitations was reasonable and was far outweighed by the state's benefit receiving compensation for highway damage. Thus, it was a reasonable nondiscriminatory burden and was tolerated.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the judgment because although the plea agreement with the co-defendants that included the no testimony agreement was misconduct by the prosecutor that was intended to deprive defendants of compulsory process, in order to prevail defendants must have established prejudice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed their convictions for possession of a prohibited weapon. A sawed-off shotgun, possession of a sawed-off shotgun and two handguns with a purpose to use them unlawfully, and possession without obtaining a permit to carry two handguns. The court concluded that defendants' motion for acquittal was properly denied. Their claims that the verdicts were against the weight of the evidence and of an improper jury charge were not preserved for appeal, and, nonetheless, were without merit. The court affirmed the convictions, except two charges were merged and the corresponding sentences were vacated. The essence of the offenses was the failure to have a permit and the unlawful purpose, and neither was expanded or diminished by the quantity of weapons constructively possessed. The court concluded that the handgun convictions for no permit and the convictions for unlawful purpose should have been merged. One defendant did not have written notice of the intention to impose an extended sentence, thus, those sentences were vacated and remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the convictions, except the handgun convictions, which were merged and the sentences imposed on those counts were vacated. The sentences imposed on two counts were vacated for one of defendant and the matter remanded to the trial judge for resentencing, without extended terms. On remand, the trial judge was directed to set forth expanded statements of reasons for the sentences imposed upon two of defendants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant advertising company was the low bidder for a contract to provide advertising for the New Jersey Lottery Commission, but respondent, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Purchase and Property, rejected appellant's bid because of an appearance of wrongdoing associated with appellant's relationship with the lottery commission director. The court vacated the order rejecting appellant's bid and held that the standard respondent applied was non-objective and improper and that respondent abused his discretion in applying it. The court found that rejecting public bids based on a subjective standard of an appearance of wrongdoing absent a finding of actual wrongdoing would undermine confidence in the public bidding process. The court directed that the contract be awarded to appellant and found no principled basis on which to say that respondent could reject bidders for contracts with the lottery commission under criteria distinctly different from those applicable to other user agencies.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant parents unsuccessfully challenged the refusal by the local board of education (board) of their request for private school transportation for their child to a private school in Pennsylvania. Appellants sought review of respondent New Jersey Commissioner of Education's decision and alleged that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:39-1 was unconstitutional as a violation of equal protection if limited to New Jersey. On review, the court affirmed respondent's decision. The court first noted that respondent lacked jurisdiction to decide constitutional claims, but that their decision was sound. The court held that the equal protection clause did not require uniformity provided that the classification was reasonable. The court found that controlling the expenditures of local school boards by limiting buses to school in New Jersey was a reasonable classification that did not offend equal protection. Thus, the limitation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:39-1 to payment for transportation within the state was constitutionally permissible.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a state trooper conducted a routine stop of defendant's vehicle and discovered a knife and marijuana, defendant was charged with unlawful possession of marijuana, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, and unlawful possession of a dangerous weapon. When his motion to suppress the evidence was denied, defendant pleaded guilty to counts two and three under a plea agreement that dismissed count one. Defendant later filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court granted defendant's petition, suppressed the evidence, and vacated his conviction. On appeal, the court reversed. The court found that while the valid search of defendant's car had become invalid by retroactive application of case law since his arrest, the application of two more recent cases had made the search valid again. The court found that pursuant to these cases, the search of both the interior and the trunk of defendant's car was reasonable, and constitutionally permissible, and the evidence should not have been suppressed.

The court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:11-4 was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The court determined that the statute gives a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited so that he or she may conform his acts to the law.

The ordinance did not violate due process, as it was not arbitrary or unreasonable. The ordinance did not violate U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owner challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Atlantic County (New Jersey), which enforced a default judgment rendered against defendant owner and defendant driver in Pennsylvania for liability to plaintiffs, injured party and spouse, arising from an automobile accident that involved defendant owner's vehicle driven by his spouse, defendant driver.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owner allowed defendant driver to take his vehicle to Pennsylvania, where she was in an accident. Plaintiffs, injured party and spouse, brought suit in Pennsylvania and recovered a default judgment against defendants for damages arising out of the accident. Defendant owner contended that Pennsylvania did not have personal jurisdiction over him such that the instant New Jersey trial court must give full faith and credit to the judgment. Pennsylvania's long-arm statute,&nbsp;75 P.S. &sect; 2001 (Supp. 1971), included a nonresident owner of a motor vehicle operated in Pennsylvania with his consent. However, the court held that defendant owner did not purposefully avail himself of activities in Pennsylvania by casually giving his wife permission to drive his vehicle there on her personal business. Thus, the judgment entered against defendant owner was not entitled to full faith and credit. Defendants' other issues were rendered moot by this opinion reversing that judgment. Because defendant driver died, those having an interest in her estate had to be made parties as required by N.J. R. Civ. P. 4:34-1(b) before a judgment against her estate could be valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment against defendant owner because he did not purposefully avail himself of activities in Pennsylvania, and thus the judgment against him was not entitled to full faith and credit in New Jersey. The court also reversed and remanded the judgment against defendant driver because she had subsequently died, and plaintiffs, injured party and spouse, had to substitute a proper party before proceeding against her estate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mortgage holder and appellant city challenged the judgment of the Superior Court, Passaic County (New Jersey), which was entered in the state's favor and which held that the Spill Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58:10-23.11f(f), gave the state a paramount lien over appellant city's preexisting tax lien and the interests of appellant mortgage holder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Toxic chemicals had been illegally stored on the property at issue. The property owner entered into a consent order with the state to clean up the property. The property owner defaulted under the consent order. The state obtained an order to clean up the site and expended considerable sums in performing that task. Appellant city also expended considerable sums in assisting in the clean up. Thereafter, appellant mortgage holder filed a complaint to foreclose on the property. Appellant city asserted a statutory lien on the property for unpaid taxes. The state filed its lien pursuant to the Spill Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 58:10-23.11f(f). The trial court entered judgment in the state's favor. Appellants challenged that judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The Spill Act lien provision was retroactive. Thus, appellant city's lien did not have priority over the state's lien. Also, appellant city had no rights against the state based on impairment of its statutory lien. If any impairment of appellant mortgage holder's contract occurred, such impairment was permissible under the state's police power. The imposition of the Spill Act lien was not a taking without just compensation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment which was entered in favor of the state. Because the state had been required to remove toxic waste from the subject property, the trial court properly gave it a priority lien over appellant city's preexisting tax lien on the property and appellant mortgage holder's interests in the property.</SPAN></P>

Respondent countered that the statute was unconstitutional because it was based on an irrational classification and that the ordinance was therefore valid and enforceable. After the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent, appellant sought review. The court held that the statute constituted a valid exercise of legislative power because it bore a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental objective. The legislative scheme of which the statute was a part accorded municipalities the right to give preference to candidates who were also residents while allowing the municipalities to consider non-residents if necessary to maintain an adequate police force. The court held that the scheme constituted a rational response to a governmental problem. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant widower appealed a judgment from the Tax Court of New Jersey that upheld the constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-3.30, in a suit by plaintiff Borough of Wrightstown to collect a property tax, despite the law's facial discrimination against widowers of disabled war veterans in the granting of a tax exemption to widows of disabled war veterans only.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant widower's deceased wife was a disabled veteran. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-3.30 provided that widows of disabled veterans were entitled to an exemption from property taxes, but widowers of disabled veterans were not. The court held that &sect; 54:4-3.30 and other similar discriminatory statutes violated the U.S. Const. amend XIV guarantee of equal protection insofar as they withheld from spouses of female veterans the tax relief given to spouses of male veterans. The court held that the state's policy of cushioning the financial impact of spousal loss upon the sex for whom that loss imposed a disproportionately heavy burden was not a sufficient governmental objective to support the classification. Because the class of women receiving the tax break was restricted to the wives of veterans, as opposed to all women, the tax break required further justification. This back-handed discrimination was unconstitutional. Rather than deprive the current beneficiaries of the exemption, and noting that the constitutional authorization for the exemption, N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 1, para. 3, was now gender-neutral, the court construed the statute to extend to widowers as well as widows.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment for plaintiff Borough of Wrightstown and reinstated the judgment for defendant widower. The court held that a tax exemption extended to the widows of disabled veterans but not to widowers of disabled veterans was a back-handed discrimination against women based on outmoded stereotypes, was not supported by an adequate governmental interest, and violated equal protection of the laws.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court held that defendant municipality could not set off a refund of real estate taxes due plaintiff trustee in bankruptcy against taxes due for subsequent years on the same property. On appeal, the court affirmed. The amendment to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:3-27.2 that authorized any municipal governing body to set off a refund of real estate property taxes against delinquent taxes owed on the same property became effective nearly a year after the action was commenced, and the action did not fall within the enumerated types of pending actions to which the amendment applied. Defendant asserted that plaintiff was equitably estopped from bringing this action, but defendant did not rely upon any conduct of plaintiff and was not led to change its position by any conduct of or inaction by plaintiff. There was no unreasonable delay by plaintiff in instituting suit for funds rightly due under a prior judgment. Defendant, of its own volition, improperly applied the refund to delinquent taxes instead of making a refund to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

Defendant did not rely on any conduct of plaintiff, and plaintiff was thus not estopped from bringing the action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged the decision of the Superior Court, Law Division, Ocean County (New Jersey), finding them guilty of conspiracy, tampering with a witness and bribery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, attorney and defendant, were both found guilty of conspiracy. Appellant attorney was also found guilty of tampering with a witness and appellant defendant was found guilty of bribery. On appeal, the court found that appellant attorney attended an arranged meeting between himself and the complaining parties. At that meeting, appellant attorney indicated that appellant defendant had altered the original arrest report and discussed the possibility of having a putative witness purposely fail to identify appellant attorney's client. The court reasoned that this was sufficient evidence indicating appellant attorney was involved in tampering with the putative witness. Both appellants contended that the trial judge erroneously refused to hold a charge hearing. The court found that neither party requested a charge hearing, nor was the trial judge required to hold a charge hearing. Further, the court found that appellants did not object to the trial judge's failure to hold a charge hearing until after deliberations began. The court also rejected appellants' argument that the conviction for conspiracy should be reversed because the other conspirators were undercover agents.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellants' convictions for conspiracy, tampering with a witness and bribery. The court held that there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant attorney co-conspired to tamper with a putative witness. Further, the court found that the trial judge did not commit error in his procedure in framing and delivering the jury charge.</SPAN></P>

Appellant's municipal budget had been denied, because it failed to deduct an amount equal to the cost of providing street lighting services after transferring responsibility for those services pursuant to N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant borough challenged the decision that denied approval of its municipal budget. Appellant created a lighting district pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 40:91-1 et seq. and transferred responsibility for its street lighting services. Appellee Director of the Division of Local Government Services disapproved the budget, because it had not deducted the amount equal to what it had expended to provide street lighting services in violation of 1981 N.J. Laws ch. 64, &sect; 1, the supplement to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:4-45.2. Appellant argued that the retroactive application of that law divested appellant of a vested right, the right to establish a lighting district as a means of creating a valid legal exemption to the &quot;CAP&quot; law, in violation of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed, holding that appellant, as a political subdivision of the state, had no standing to invoke protection of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV against the state. Appellant had no vested right by its creation of a lighting district prior to the enactment of the law, which was a valid exercise of the legislature's control over the financial affairs of appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An administrative law judge's initial decision was overridden by appellee health commissioner's conclusion that contracts between appellants, health management corporations, and physician practice groups altered the essential private-practice character of the physician groups, making them subject to agency and regulatory control under The New Jersey Health Care Facilities Planning Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 26:2H-1 et seq. In a consolidated appeal, the court reversed, holding that, while appellants were health care facilities regulated by the Act, the business services appellants' provided to the physicians did not impinge upon the ordinary patient-private physician relationship or professional control by the physicians. Thus, the physicians' work in appellants' facilities was considered to be private practice, which exempted them from regulation under the Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged his car, which was used by his son in three robberies, was not subject to forfeiture. On appeal, the court held forfeitures could be justified only if the owner could have prevented the abuse for which the forfeiture proceeding was begun. The court reversed the forfeiture and remanded for a plenary hearing because the record did not show defendant's property was used to further an unlawful purpose. Although the 1981 amendments to the forfeiture statute excised the exemption from forfeiture for an owner of property who had not consented and was not privy to the unlawful use of this property, the court inferred the legislature did not intend forfeiture to be applied inflexibly in all cases. Forfeitures could be justified only where it was within the owner's power to prevent the abuse for which the forfeiture proceeding was begun. It was difficult to reject an owner's constitutional claim when his property was taken from him without his privity or consent or when he proved, not only that he was uninvolved in and unaware of the wrongful activity, but also that he had done all that reasonably could be expected to prevent the proscribed use of his property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant retiree sought review of an order of respondent Board of Trustees of Public Employees' Retirement System (New Jersey), which denied the payment of pre- and post-judgment interest pursuant to N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant retiree was awarded a judgment against respondent Board of Trustees of Public Employees' Retirement System for overpayments. Appellant received a payment and notified respondent that he was entitled to interest. Respondent refused to pay interest and denied appellant a hearing. Respondent contended that there was no provision in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43:15A-1 et seq. to pay interest on the refund of moneys other than when a member withdrew from the system. On appeal, the court held that appellant should have received interest on his excess contributions from the date of deposit and on his pension arrearages from the date due until the date of final payment. Appellant did not waive his right to interest because there was no point at which he had been required to raise it. In the absence of a statutory provision for interest on an obligation of a governmental entity, a legislative purpose to allow interest was found in the nature of the burden imposed and the relative equities between the beneficiaries. Interest was due because appellant had been required to overpay his contributions, at respondent's direction, and received no benefit from the improper retention of his funds.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff doctors of osteopathy challenged the validity of N.J. Stat. Ann. 45:9-16 and N.J. Admin. Code tit. 13, &sect;&sect; 35-4.1, 35-6.13, which were implemented by the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff doctors of osteopathy challenged the validity of N.J. Stat. Ann. 45:9-16 and N.J. Admin. Code tit. 13, &sect;&sect; 35-4.1, 35-6.13, implemented by the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners (Board). One plaintiff previously brought similar claims, which were rejected. The court ruled that res judicata and collateral estoppel did not bar the remaining plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs objected to the designations of &quot;M.D.&quot; and &quot;D.O.&quot; on licenses and in advertising. The court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. 45:9-16 restricted the Board to issue licenses to practice, but did not authorize a degree designation, and the court found no implied authority allowing the Board to do so. The court concluded that the Board exceeded its statutory powers in designating M.D. and/or D.O. on licenses and in adopting the challenged regulations. The court enjoined the Board from placing the designations on licenses issued in New Jersey. However, the court found no federal or state equal protection violations in the licensing scheme, and that the challenged regulations on commercial speech did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I or N.J. Const. art. I, para. 6.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant applicant was found guilty of kidnapping, which at the time was a high misdemeanor. Appellant's sentence to several years in prison was commuted. After his release, appellant was granted a writ of habeas corpus, which was never challenged. Several years later, appellant applied for a private detective license. The state police department denied the license application because appellant's conviction for kidnapping created a regulatory disqualification of appellant as an applicant for a private detective license. Appellant requested an administrative hearing. The administrative law judge concluded that appellant's license denial, solely on the ground that his disqualifying conviction for a high misdemeanor was still of record, was appropriate. The court reversed, holding that the reliability of the facts supporting appellant's conviction for kidnapping was inherently suspect and that his unchallenged habeas corpus nullified his state criminal conviction. The court remanded the matter to the state police department for reconsideration of appellant's application for a private detective license as if the record of the kidnapping conviction never existed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, who were tried together by a jury, challenged a judgment of the Superior Court, Atlantic County (New Jersey), which convicted them of three counts of possession of a stolen credit card and one count of unlawful possession of an automatic pistol in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-5b.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were each convicted of three counts of possession of a stolen credit card and one count of unlawful possession of a so-called B.B. automatic pistol in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-5b. Defendants challenged the convictions, arguing that &sect; 2C:39-5b and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:39-2b, taken together, impermissibly relieved the state of its obligation to prove each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Under &sect; 2C:39-2b, where the legality of a person's conduct depended on the possession of a license or a permit, it was presumed that he did not possess such a license or permit until he established the contrary. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions. The court concluded that the statutory presumption was constitutional because it met the rational connection criterion and because it was not accorded mandatory effect. The court found that defendants, who were apprehended in possession of a weapon, would of necessity have been in the best position to offer proof of compliance with the license or permit requirements. The court also found that the trial court charged the jury in a constitutionally acceptable manner with regard to the presumption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both houses of the state legislature passed an annual appropriations bill and presented it to respondent governor for review and signature. Respondent objected to several items and used his line-item veto power to delete them. The legislature did not attempt to override respondent's veto. Appellants, the speaker of the general assembly and the president of the senate, filed an action seeking a declaration that respondent had exceeded his constitutional authority in his use of the line-item veto. The court held that respondent's use of the line-item veto to delete certain items that were not items of appropriation of money violated N.J. Const. (1947) art. V, &sect; 1, para. 15. The court ruled that the failure of the legislature to attempt to override respondent's veto did not validate his improper use of the line-item veto power, but struck down those portions of the new law that it held unconstitutional. The court held that respondent's deletion of items related to public utilities franchise and gross receipts tax revenues was a proper use of the line-item veto because those were items of appropriation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from the decision of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Monmouth County (New Jersey), which found that he was not entitled to expungement of the record of his conviction for drug offenses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had previously pled guilty to two drug offenses in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 24:21-19. He later sought expungement of the criminal record, which could have prevented his licensing as a real estate agent. He sought expungement under the predecessor statute to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:52-25, claiming that the new statute did not apply to him based on the ex post facto doctrine. The prior statute permitted expungement as of right to youthful offenders, while the new statute no longer did so. The trial court held that &sect; 2C:52-25 was retroactive and applicable to defendant. On appeal, the court affirmed. The trial court properly rejected defendant's federal constitutional challenge based on ex post facto and due process principles. Any injury allegedly sustained by defendant in being unable to obtain a real estate license was speculative and indirect. The expungement statute was remedial, not punitive. Expungement was only a potential remedy, not a right that inured to defendant's benefit. Defendant's criminal record was not part of the sentence and punishment. Thus, he had no constitutionally protected right to assume that the legislative remedy of expungement was immutable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed denial of defendant's right to expungement of his criminal record. The rejection of that right based on a new, stricter statute did not violate defendant's constitutional rights, as it was not an ex post facto law, and defendant had no constitutional right to expungement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorney brought a complaint against respondent board of education based on his dismissal as counsel without a fair and impartial hearing demonstrating good cause. The trial court found that the tenure provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 38:16-1 were inapplicable and that, under N.J. Disciplinary R. 2-110(B)(4), appellant was required to withdraw from his position as attorney when his client no longer wanted him as its counsel. Appellant sought review, and the court affirmed, finding that &sect; 38:16-1 and R. 2-110(B)(4) were in direct conflict. The court found that the general legislative grant of tenure of &sect; 38:16-1 must give way to R. 2-110(B)(4), which was enacted by the N.J. Supreme Court under its exclusive constitutional responsibility for regulation of the practice of law pursuant to N.J. Const. art. VI, &sect; II, para. 3 (1947).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the judgment of the Superior Court of Bergen County, New Jersey, which convicted him of possession of heroin with intent to distribute, possession of heroin and cocaine, and possession in an automobile of a .22-caliber pistol without first having obtained the requisite permit. The trial court sentenced defendant to $ 25 as a mandatory penalty under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-3.1(a)(2).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of heroin with intent to distribute, possession of heroin and cocaine, and possession in an automobile of a .22-caliber pistol without first having obtained the requisite permit. Defendant sought review of the judgment and challenged the imposition of the mandatory fines of $ 25 pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-3.1a(2). The court held that it was clear from the sentencing transcript that the trial judge felt constrained to impose for each conviction the $ 25 penalty required by &sect; 2C:43-3.1a(2). The court held that the trial judge erred when he imposed the $ 25 penalties. The new code expressly provided that it did not apply to offenses committed prior to its effective date. Because defendant committed the crimes for which he was convicted prior to the effective date, and defendant did not voluntarily consent to be sentenced under the new code pursuant to the provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:1-1c(2), the trial judge could not impose the mandatory penalties. The penalty was unquestionably barred by the prohibition of ex post facto legislation found in U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1, and N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, par. 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and vacated the imposition of the $ 25 mandatory penalties imposed upon defendant, and affirmed as modified. The matter was remanded for entry of an amendatory judgment. Defendant committed the crimes for which he was convicted prior to the effective date of the new code, and the trial court could not impose mandatory penalties of $ 25 as part of the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment from the Superior Court of New Jersey, Atlantic County, after he was convicted of distributing methamphetamine, receiving a stolen police motorcycle, misconduct in office in connection with the sale of the police motorcycle, and receiving stolen police identification cards. The conviction for receiving the stolen motorcycle was vacated and an aggregate sentence of eight years was imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a police officer, was arrested after selling a police motorcycle, police identification cards, and speed to undercover officers. On review of his conviction for distributing methamphetamine, misconduct in office in connection with the sale of a police motorcycle, and receiving stolen police identification cards, defendant argued that he was the victim of entrapment due to his drug and alcohol addiction. The court affirmed defendant's convictions, finding that the defense of subjective entrapment was not of constitutional dimension. Placing the burden of proving entrapment on defendant under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:2-12(b), was not improper as long as the state still had to prove every element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The change in burden of proof was intended to both objective and subjective entrapment. There was no evidence of egregious conduct by the state to support the defense of objective entrapment. There was no prejudice from a charge on objective entrapment. Defendant's misconduct in office charge was supported by his status as a public servant at the time of the offense. Defendant's sentence was within the trial court's discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, finding that the burden of proof was properly on defendant to prove entrapment, whether subjective or objective. There was no showing of objective entrapment, but defendant was not prejudiced by the instruction on objective entrapment. Aggravating circumstances substantially outweighed mitigating factors in defendant's sentence and there was no abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city and associated individuals, sought review of a judgment of the Superior Court of Essex County (New Jersey), which declared that the appointment of police chiefs in unclassified civil service as required by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:69A-60.7 was unconstitutional as special legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city and associated individuals, adopted a Plan C form of government. After the city police chief retired, defendants did not appoint a new chief for several years. During that time, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:69A-60.7 was enacted which provided that any governing body of any city of the first class which adopted Plan C could provide by ordinance that the mayor appoint a police director and that the director was in the unclassified civil service. Plaintiff deputy police chiefs challenged the statute, and the trial court ruled that it was special legislation enacted in violation of N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, para. 9(13). On appeal, the court affirmed because there was no rational basis for cities not of the first class, cities which did not adopt the plan, and municipalities other than cities, to be excluded from the class which may adopt the ordinance. The statute's purpose of assuring the police chief's cooperation with the municipal administration was not a reasonable explanation of why the legislation was not equally desirable for other municipalities, thus, the classification did not have a reasonable basis and was unconstitutional special legislation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment that statute was special legislation that violated the state constitution was affirmed. There was no reasonable basis for the statute's classification that only cities of the first class that adopted a specific plan of government could enact an ordinance that allowed the mayor to appoint a police director.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs brought an action and sought to tack benefits under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:9-5, based upon prior employment in county government.

The court ruled that a lawful use of a weapon did not necessarily legitimate its prior possession and that the proscription contained within &sect; 2C:39-5(d) was against possession, not use. Further, the court held that the issue was not whether a weapon could be lawfully used, but whether the circumstances surrounding the possession were manifestly appropriate for such lawful uses. The court affirmed defendant's conviction and concluded that &sect; 2C:39-5(d) was not unconstitutionally vague because it gave sufficient notice that the conduct charged was criminal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of a violation of Belmar, N.J., Ordinance 5-1.2 which prohibited indecent exposure. On her appeal, the conviction was reversed, without consideration of the merits, on the ground that the subject matter of the ordinance was preempted by statute. The borough appealed and the court reversed the order reversing the conviction. The court held that the enactment of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:14-4, which prohibited lewd acts, was not intended to preclude a municipality from prohibiting public nudity of a character which did not rise to the level of lewdness as therein defined but which it nevertheless regarded as indecent by prevailing community standards. Municipalities were precluded from exercising their delegated police powers on preemption grounds only if an enactment was intended to exclusively occupy the legislated area, or if the ordinance conflicted with the objectives, policy, or provision of state law, or if the subject matter was one requiring by its nature a uniform state-wide approach, or if the state law was so pervasive or comprehensive that it precluded coexistence of municipal regulation. The ordinance here met none of the tests of preemption.</SPAN></P>

With respect to lands that were not tide-flowed for 40 years immediately before the adoption of the amendment, the state was given an additional one-year after the adoption of the amendment to assert its claim. Plaintiff landowners filed suit alleging that the amendment was invalid. The court concluded that the amendment was invalid because the state could not complete its mapping process within the one-year in order to assert its claim to certain lands. Defendant state officers appealed. After review, this court concluded that the amendment was, in all respects, valid and that in order for the state to comply with the amendment, it had to specifically define and assert a claim. The contention that some persons' property would be timely mapped and others would not was without merit. The trial court's judgment was reversed, and the complaint was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that &sect; 2C:39-5(d) was neither vague nor overbroad.

The court held that where the DEP had the duty to &quot;promote the public health, safety, and welfare under N.J. Stat.

As such, the court found that the DEP could engage in inclusionary zoning, which required low and moderate income housing to be built, where it had the duty to &quot;promote the public health, safety, and welfare.

The court held that the failure of the hearing officers to allow evidence on the reasonableness of the minimum base period challenge, the accuracy of the economic factor, and the validity of the geographic equalization factor was not arbitrary, capricious or a denial of due process. The court held that the carry-over process did not deny appellants the opportunity to establish the reasonableness of the prior year's over-expenditures. The court held that appellants were not entitled to individual hearings on the desirability of economic and geographic equalization factors because that was part of the rulemaking process.

Appellant sought review and asserted that the trial court erred in declaring the statutes unconstitutional. The court agreed and held that because the statutes were carefully tailored to reach only conduct which knowingly facilitated or promoted violations of the criminal law, they did not impinge on any constitutionally protected conduct. The court noted that respondents' right to sell smoking accessories and a purchaser's right to buy and use them were entitled to only minimal due process protection. The court reasoned that regulation of items that had some lawful as well as unlawful uses was not an irrational means of discouraging drug use.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant police union filed a grievance claiming benefits under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:9-5, which credited the period of a municipal employee's prior employment by a county or other municipality to his current period of employment. The grievance was denied by the Director of Public Safety, and the ensuing arbitration resulted in an award directing plaintiff city to grant the grievants credit for prior service under &sect; 40A:9-5. The trial court confirmed the award, and plaintiff sought review, contending that because of an intervening court decision, &sect; 40A:9-5 was unconstitutional and that the award thus must be vacated. The court affirmed the confirmation of the arbitration award. It held that the arbitrator's incorporation of the statutory rights into the grievants' union contract was not vitiated by the intervening finding of unconstitutionality of the statute. It reasoned that the disputed benefits were intended, to the extent that they were negotiable in the absence of the statute, to be encompassed by the arbitration award, and that any remaining issues as to the scope of the benefits should be resolved through recourse to the Public Employment Relations Commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, U.S. House of Representatives members, filed an application challenging the constitutionality of 1982 N.J. Laws 1. Petitioners claimed that the process by which that law was passed violated N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; IV, para. 6, in that the bill enacted proceeded to a third reading without a one day interval and without a three-fourths vote to proceed in this fashion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New Jersey Senate passed a redistricting bill and forwarded it to the General Assembly. By the time the Senate bill arrived in the General Assembly, an identical bill had received two readings there six days earlier. The Senate bill was read in the General Assembly, and on a motion passed by less than a three-fourths vote, received a second reading. The Senate bill, by motion, was then substituted for the General Assembly bill, and was immediately read a third time, was passed, and was delivered to the governor and signed into law. Petitioners, U.S. House of Representatives members, challenged this procedure. The court held that the procedure did not offend the provision of the N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; IV, para. 6, that required a one-day interval between the second and third readings of a bill in either house unless three-fourths of the members of the house agreed to dispense with the interval. The court reasoned that because the bills were identical as to their content, if not their number or sponsor, they were but one bill, and the required interval between readings was satisfied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the application of petitioners, U.S. House of Representatives members. The court held that the procedure employed in the passage of a redistricting bill did not unconstitutionally dispense with the one-day interval between second and third readings of the bill readings, because between the two identical bills that were read to the General Assembly, there was a one day-interval between the readings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State challenged an order by the Superior Court of New Jersey which imposed a sentence of probation upon defendant for his conviction for the offenses of armed robbery, unlawful possession of a shotgun without first having obtained the requisite firearms purchaser's identification card, and possession of a shotgun with purpose of using unlawfully against another person. Defendant appealed his judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty by a jury of armed robbery, unlawful possession of a shotgun without first having obtained the requisite firearms purchaser's identification card, and possession of a shotgun with purpose of using unlawfully against another person. The trial court sentenced him to probation with a 90-day period of confinement. The court found that the state's cross-examination of defendant regarding his unemployment and substantial financial obligations was proper because the state's questioning of defendant was in direct response to defendant's testimony that he was employed and had money on the date of the armed robbery. The court dismissed the state's appeal of defendant's sentence because defendant's constitutional guarantee against double punishment barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause would be violated if the appeal resulted in an increase in his sentence. The court held that jeopardy attached when defendant commenced serving his sentences. Furthermore, by the time the state moved for a stay of defendant's sentenced pursuant to N.J. R. Civ. P. r. 2:9-3(d), defendant had already served over a month of his 90-day custodial sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">State's appeal from the sentence imposed on defendant by the trial court was dismissed and defendant's conviction was affirmed because state's cross-examination of defendant regarding his unemployment was proper after he testified as to his employment and constitutional guarantee against double punishment would have been violated if the appeal were to result in the court increasing his sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile was adjudicated a delinquent for directing threatening and vulgar language towards a police officer for an extended period of time. Defendant moved to set aside the adjudication on the basis that the complaint failed to set out a violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:33-2(b). Defendant contended the statute was unconstitutional because it could punish as a criminal act spoken words arguably protected by the First Amendment. The court rejected defendant's motion to set aside the adjudication of delinquency. The court determined that the statute extended only to unreasonably loud and offensively coarse or abusive language, and only when the speaker's intent was to offend the hearer or where he recklessly disregarded the likelihood of such offending. Language alone was no longer enough to support a conviction merely because it was vulgar. Therefore, the statute was constitutional because it did not seek to punish the speaker merely for speaking vulgar language. Defendant was in violation of the statute because defendant's prolonged harassment of the officer was a clear indication that the juvenile meant to offend the officer.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant commercial tenants leased commercial premises from plaintiff landlords for the purpose of operating a retail store. After defendants fell two months behind in their rent, plaintiffs instructed a municipal constable to secure the premises. One of the defendants notified a government agency which had a security interest in defendants' property. Plaintiffs gave the keys to the premises to the agency, and it auctioned off all of the goods to satisfy its security interest. Plaintiffs then brought an action against defendants for unpaid rent. Defendants counterclaimed for damages arising out of the allegedly illegal distraint issued by the constable. The trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs and dismissed defendants' complaint. On appeal, the court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:33-1 et seq., the statute that permitted plaintiffs to seize defendants' property without any notice and without any prior judicial review, violated due process and was unconstitutional. However, the court also held that plaintiffs were entitled to damages because defendants were liable for the unpaid rent. Judgment was affirmed in part and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>

The court remanded the action to the Law Division for a de novo trial pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 3:23. The Law Division erred in concluding it lacked jurisdiction to hear defendant's collateral attack on the validity of N.J. Admin. Code tit. 16:30-3.6. The state supreme court, in its adoption of N.J. Ct. R. 3:10-3, expressly authorized the Law Division to consider, in criminal proceedings, collateral attacks on regulations. The state supreme court also by way of N.J. Ct. R. 3:23 and N.J. Ct.

Appellants sought review of the trial court judgment, arguing that at the time of adoption in 1948 New Jersey law barred an illegitimate child from inheriting from her natural father. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, holding that the trial court correctly applied the law of inheritance as it existed in New Jersey at the time of decedent's death. The court held that that law allowed inheritance by illegitimate children from either the natural mother or natural father. The court further held that the right of inheritance did not conflict with the adoption laws of New Jersey as they existed in 1948, the year of illegitimate child was adopted. The court also held that a mere expectation of property in the future was not considered a vested right, and hence the rules of descent were subject to change in their application to all estates not already passed to the heir by the death of the owner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff county executive and sheriff challenged the order of the Superior Court, Law Division, Atlantic County (New Jersey), which upheld defendant governor's executive order giving authority to defendant Commissioner of the Department of Corrections to alleviate inmate overcrowding in state and county correctional facilities as a temporary measure under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; A:9-30 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant Governor of New Jersey (governor) issued an executive order, declaring a state of emergency in state and county correctional facilities because of overcrowding. The 90-day order stated that defendant Department of Corrections (department) was unable to accept inmates sentenced to the department and authorized the department to allocate inmates of state and county institutions to those institutions with available space. Plaintiff county executive and sheriff filed a complaint, seeking to compel the department to accept prisoners from plaintiffs' county based on N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:43-10(e) and N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:4-6. The trial court denied relief. The court affirmed and held that the extensive powers delegated by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; A:9-30 gave the governor the means to deal with an emergency until the legislature acted. The court further held that the specific power delegated to utilize and employ all the available resources of each political subdivision of New Jersey to avoid or protect against any emergency clearly gave authority to utilize and employ, temporarily, county correctional facilities, fairly paid for, as needed, without plaintiffs' consent.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 2C:17-2(c). The incident involved his placing a smoke bomb in a vacant locker in the high school. Upon discovery the school officials evacuated the school and closed it for two days, canceling school activities. The incident received widespread notoriety due to the mistaken information that the device was explosive and lethal. A social investigation was ordered by the court and the matter was listed for dispositional hearing. The newspapers moved to open the dispositional proceedings to the press. That court denied the request and held that fear of publication of intimate details of their lives would inhibit the family's open discussion of their situation. Good cause had been shown that the juvenile's interest in a closed, confidential hearing greatly outweighed any interest of the public in the details of his family life. The best interest of the juvenile would not be served by permitting the press to attend his dispositional hearing. The court would conduct a closed dispositional hearing.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the commission properly weighed the evidence in concluding that appellant part owners did not possess the good character demanded by the Act. However, in affirming, the court excepted that part of the divestiture requirement that applied to non-New Jersey non-gaming subsidiaries of appellant casino and related entities because such requirement did not serve legitimate state interests.

The superior court affirmed the convictions after de novo review. Defendant appealed, arguing that the statute exempted dump trucks. Plaintiff state argued that the statute only exempted dump trucks that required complete freedom around the wheel for their designed use. The court affirmed, holding that because N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-79.2 allowed for imprisonment, it was penal and quasi-criminal, and thus required strict construction; the legislative intent was to exempt from the requirement only those vehicles that needed such exemption for complete freedom around the rear wheels; the absence of a legislative amendment following the opinion of the attorney general giving the same interpretation suggested that such interpretation was correct; and mud flaps would not have interfered with the trucks' hauling of gravel.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was 25 years of age at the time of the offense; his victim was an 11-year-old girl. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:138-1, the carnal abuse statute, provided for punishment by sentence up to 30 years for any person who unlawfully and carnally abused a woman-child under the age of 12 years with or without consent. Defendant contended that the statute violated the Equal Protection Clause because the penal sanction was not similarly extended to females who offended against young males. The point was extensively considered in the trial judge's written opinion in which he ruled against defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment. The statute, though gender differentiating, served a valid legislative purpose through a reasonable classification. Defendant's remaining two contentions, that the trial judge erred in permitting the testimony of two police officers, and that his sentence was manifestly excessive, under N.J. Ct. R. 2:11-3(e)(2), were clearly without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner retired employee began receiving pension benefits upon his retirement under the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS). Respondent board of trustees of PERS then cancelled petitioner's retirement allowance because he was receiving retirement benefits from another state and was ineligible for PERS membership pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43:3C-1. Respondent affirmed its original decision denying benefits, and the court affirmed respondent's decision. There was an unambiguous statutory declaration that deprived respondent of jurisdictional authority to award pension benefits under the circumstances and the doctrine of equitable estoppel was inapplicable. There was no evidence that any agent, employee, or representative of the Division of Pensions or PERS made representations of any kind to petitioner to induce him to accept the state employment. The court rejected petitioner's attack on the constitutionality of &sect; 43:3C-1 finding no equal protection violation. The different treatment between state and federal employees had a rational basis because federal pensioners were not given credit for pension purposes for time served in out-of-state public employment.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs appealed and the court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the case for entry of the court's judgment of a fee allowance. The court found that the ordinance was invalidated by the trial judge on the federal and state grounds asserted by plaintiffs. The court was satisfied that the trial court had the authority to award counsel fees. The court found that there was no special circumstance here presented which would render an award of counsel fees unjust. The court held that where a party prevails on both state and fee-qualifying federal issues, an apportionment may be made in respect of the legal services involved in each and an award allowed pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 for the services attributable to the federal issue.

A track steward requested the state police to search defendant's stable area for drugs pursuant to N. J. Admin. Code tit.13, &sect; 14.21(a)(2). Defendant offered to take the officers to his stables in his pick-up truck. Defendant opened the truck's glove compartment and the officers saw a syringe.

The court held that the search was a valid warrantless administrative search. The court held that the Racing Commission had the power to authorize warrantless administrative searches. The court held that tit.13, &sect; 14.21(a)(2) was constitutional because horse racing was subject to pervasive and long-standing regulation by the state.

The court affirmed the part of appellee's order requiring payment to appellant for unpaid claims without interest or counsel fees, and reversed the part of the order requiring appellant to pay the monetary penalty assessed pursuant to &sect; 30:4D-17(c), directing appellant to pay the amount of overpayment made to him.

Appellant sought to stay the effectiveness of the rule pending appeal, which the court denied. The court held that respondent's rule was subject to a rebuttable presumption of validity and that appellant did not carry its burden of proving that the rule was unreasonable. The court held that respondent had broad statutory authority to regulate the practices of medicine, surgery, and chiropractic and the standards of conduct within each and that a trial-type hearing was not statutorily mandated for the adoption of respondent's &quot;rule&quot; as that term was defined in N.J.

Appellant challenged the conditions imposed. Upon review, the court affirmed. The court held that the pervasive government regulation exception to the warrant requirement applied because the activity proposed by appellant was integrally related to the issue of water pollution and conservation resources, which was an activity that was extensively regulated. The court reasoned that appellant's participation in the activity resulted in submission to the inspections and that the inspections were reasonably necessary to the enforcement of water pollution regulations. The court found that the permit provision requiring the facility to have a licensed operator was authorized under the Water Pollution Control Act, N. J. Stat.

A hearing was held at appellant's request and appellant contended for the first time that representation of the three defendants by three public defenders from the same office created an irreconcilable conflict of interest. Before trial began, appellant's counsel sought an adjournment and sought to withdraw because appellant refused to confide in him in preparation of a defense. The case was tried and appellant was found guilty. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court saw no shred of support in the record to support any possible contention that counsel was ineffective. The court determined that the only witness appellant could have called to corroborate his testimony was his alleged employer whom he refused to identify to anyone. The court held that no one but appellant could be blamed for the flaw in the defense. The court found no actual conflict existed, nor was actual prejudice demonstrated.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, corporation and employees, challenged the orders of the Superior Court, Bergen County (New Jersey), which denied their motions to suppress evidence, and declined to issue habeas corpus writs and directed extradition. Pennsylvania had prosecuted appellants, who operated an oil refinery in New Jersey, for illegal dumping into a river in New Jersey that resulted in contamination of the river within the Pennsylvania borders.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, corporation and employees, operated an oil refinery in New Jersey. Appellants were illegally dumping hazardous wastes near a river in New Jersey, which resulted in contamination of the river downstream in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania prosecuted and seized documents from appellants pursuant to a warrant issued in New Jersey. The trial court denied appellants' motion to suppress, and directed appellants be extradited upon denial of their habeas corpus writs. The court affirmed on appeal. The court concluded that Pennsylvania had jurisdiction to determine the applicability of the exclusionary rule, U.S. Const. amend. IV, and the New Jersey trial court lacked justiciability because there was no actual proceeding in New Jersey. Also, the habeas writs were properly denied because there was no pre-requisite requiring a pre-arrest hearing before the governor used his discretionary power to extradite, and the governor could not be compelled to appear at a habeas corpus hearing to explain his discretionary decision. Appellants were properly charged with violations of Pennsylvania laws, as required by N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:160-10.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the orders denying appellants', corporation and employees, motion to suppress evidence and writ of habeas corpus. The court concluded that the prosecution for the illegal dumping was in Pennsylvania, and there was no justiciable matter actually before the New Jersey trial court. The court held that a pre-arrest hearing was not a prerequisite to the gubernatorial discretion to extradite appellants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, board of education and education officials, and plaintiff students appealed and cross-appealed the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Bergen County, which held that defendant board of education's school policy which banned extracurricular activities during times of traditional worship was facially constitutional, but as applied, violated U.S. Const. amend.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant board of education adopted a policy on school activities that effectively banned most extracurricular scholastic activities during times of traditional religious worship. Plaintiff students commenced an action to enjoin the policy and the lower court ultimately found that the policy was facially constitutional, but as applied, violated the Establishment Clauses of the federal and state constitutions. On appeal and cross-appeal, the court first noted that the challenge was properly in the courts because the exhaustion doctrine did not apply where the challenge was constitutional in nature and the appeal was not moot because the issue was of public importance and bound to recur in the future. The court applied the Lemon test for Establishment Clause challenges and held that defendant's policy met the three-pronged test, and consequently passed constitutional muster. Specifically, the policy had a secular purpose in that it sought to achieve compliance with statutory mandates, did not have a primary effect of advancing religion, and did not create excessive entanglement. Thus, the court affirmed in part, and reversed in part.</SPAN></P>

The basis for defendants' motions was that the facts as alleged in the complaints and proved by the state did not constitute a violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C: 17-3 a (1) because the statute required as an element the employment of fire, explosives or other dangerous means. The state contended that these motions were untimely because they were governed by N.J. Ct. R. 3:10-3, which stated that the defense that the indictment failed to charge an offense and the defense that the charge was invalid could not be considered during trial. The court reversed and remanded the cause because Rule 3:10-3 controlled, and the motions should not have been considered at trial. Further, the court held that the trial court erred in limiting the meaning of the statute that a person was guilty if he only employed fire or explosives, and that a retrial of defendants would not violate double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant police officers challenged a decision from respondent New Jersey Department of Civil Service (commission), which ruled that their years of prior service with another police department could not be tacked on to their service with respondent township in order for them to meet the 5 year continuous service requirement necessary to sit for the promotional exam. On appeal, the court affirmed respondent commission's decision. The court noted that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:21-9 stated that seniority rights of officers were based on respective and continuous services. The court found that the commission had long interpreted the &quot;continuous services&quot; referred to in &sect; 11:21-9 as services in the jurisdiction in which the examination was open. The court noted that where the commission's interpretations continued over a period of years without legislative interference, they were given great weight as evidence of the legislature's intent. The court found the argument forwarded by one of appellants that he should be declared eligible to sit for the exam, because he met the continuous service requirement after the cut-off date, but before the exam date, to be without merit.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the trial court's dismissal of appellant's complaint challenging the suspension, vacated his suspension, and remanded back to the trial court.

On appeal, the court affirmed the decision, holding that respondent properly denied the wetlands permits because the evidence supported the conclusion that the application for the development did not meet the statutory or regulatory standards. The court rejected appellants' argument that denial of the permits was an unconstitutional taking of property without compensation simply because the most profitable use of the property would have been waterfront development.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought a refund on the income taxes he paid under the New Jersey Gross Income Tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. 54A:1-1 et seq. for the 1976 tax year. He was a commission-based outside wine and liquor salesman who wanted to exclude his business expenses from his gross income. He claimed that because self-employed wine and liquor salesmen could deduct their business expenses under N.J. Stat. Ann. 54A:5-1(b), he should be allowed a similar exclusion under N.J. Stat. Ann. 54A:5-1(a). Respondent director denied his claim for a refund, and the Division of Tax Appeals affirmed the denial. Appellant claimed the denial violated the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court affirmed, holding that the statutory taxation scheme was not unconstitutional, and that there was no requirement under the constitution that all persons be treated in an identical manner. The court found that states were given broad powers to establish their taxation programs, and that differences in treatment would not be subject to attack as long as the differences were justified by an appropriate state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs became dissatisfied with the rate of reimbursement for in-patient radiological services they were receiving from defendant insurer via defendant hospitals. Plaintiffs began to bill defendant insurer's subscribers directly for the difference between the reasonable value of their professional services and the amounts paid by defendant insurer. Defendant insurer informed defendant commissioner that plaintiffs were engaging in balance-due billing. Defendant commissioner threatened termination of the defendant hospitals' agreements with defendant insurer if the balance-due billing practice was not stopped. Plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action that spawned counterclaims and third-party claims. The court held that plaintiffs' in-patient radiological treatments were included in defendant insurer's scope of coverage. Plaintiffs chose to accept reimbursement from defendant insurer via defendant hospitals and that reimbursement constituted payment in full. Acceptance of those payments imposed an obligation on plaintiffs to refrain from balance-due billing. Also, the exclusion of plaintiffs' in-hospital services from certain insurance coverage was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Superintendent, Division of State Police, found appellant police lieutenant guilty in a disciplinary hearing of making an unauthorized copy of a confidential background investigation report on the chairman of the casino control commission and of disseminating the copy to another police officer. Appellant contended that state police rules relating to handling of the report violated the Right to Know Law. The court held that the report was not a public record within the purview of the Right to Know Law, as N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 5:12-52(d), governing appointments to the casino control commission, did not require a written background inquiry of appointees to be made or maintained. The state had implied power to suspend its employees pending disposition of charges. The court held, however, that the hearing officer erred in admitting into evidence the transcribed testimony of another officer that he received a copy of the unauthorized report from appellant, as appellant had no opportunity to cross examine the officer, and the record showed that the finding of guilt was based primarily on the transcript. Accordingly, the matter was reversed and remanded for a new hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, police representatives, filed a class action suit on behalf of all county officers challenging respondent prosecutor's authority to issue three week on call subpoenas, a procedure which had been developed in response to officers' failure to appear for trial. The trial court granted summary judgment to respondent, and the court affirmed holding that a subpoena issued in New Jersey created a continuing obligation which could not be satisfied until the person was released from it. The court held that respondent was legally obligated to subpoena witnesses in the performance of his duties as a county prosecutor. The court held that notwithstanding the limited scope of the right to travel, the three-week, on-call subpoena was not an unreasonable burden or restriction on the police officers' movement. The court held that the issuance of three-week, on-call subpoenas was a reasonable solution to a problem which obstructed the efficient operation of the criminal justice system. The court held that under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40A:14-135, municipalities were required to compensate their police officers for off-duty hours spent testifying in criminal trials pursuant to a subpoena.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Grant of summary judgment to respondent prosecutor in class action suit instituted by appellants, police representatives, was affirmed because a New Jersey subpoena created a continuous obligation for the witness to appear until released, respondent had the duty to subpoena witnesses in his prosecution of criminals, and the three week period of the on call subpoena did not unreasonably restrict the officers' right to travel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant suffered personal injuries when the vehicle he was driving left the road and struck a building. He entered a guilty plea to leaving the scene of the accident and driving while on the revoked list and was sentenced to a mandatory 45-day jail term under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-40. This statute mandated such a jail term for a driver on the revoked list who was involved in an accident resulting in personal injury. Defendant challenged the sentence and contended that the statute did not apply when the personal injuries were suffered by the violator himself. The court disagreed and affirmed. The primary function of the mandatory jail term was to deter individuals whose licenses were suspended from driving and to ensure the safety of the public on the highways. There was no support for defendant's theory that the legislative concern extended to all members of the public except the violator himself as it required an illogical distortion of the plain language of the statute.</SPAN></P>

Appellant teacher's association filed a claim for arbitration with respondent board of education over the issue. Respondent filed a Petition for Scope of Negotiations Determination with the New Jersey Public Employment Relations Commission. The commission determined that paid religious holidays were unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause, U.S. Const. amend.

Appellant sought review, arguing that the commission did not have jurisdiction to consider constitutional issues. The court affirmed the decision, holding that the commission had jurisdiction to consider other laws in determining the scope of collective negotiations under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:13A-5.4(d). The court held that paid religious holidays would fail the tripartite test of having a secular purpose, not advancing nor inhibiting religion, and not being an excessive entanglement of government with religion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant's plea of non vult for murder was accepted, he was sentenced to a maximum 30 years imprisonment and the trial court outlined its reason pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 3:21-4(e). Defendant objected to trial court's assessment that crime was heinous. On appeal, defendant asserted the sentence was manifestly excessive and the trial court's reasons were insufficient because it failed to state findings of mitigating or aggravating factors enumerated in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2C:44-1, as required by Rule 3:21-4(e) and &sect; 2C:43-2(d). The court found that the trial court considered such factors although it did not specifically refer to them. Additionally, the court found statements made at sentencing appeared to meet requirements under Rule 3:21-4(e) and &sect; 2C:44-1. The court concluded the trial court acted reasonably in finding aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors and the fact certain factors were not especially mitigating did not constitute an abuse of discretion. The issue of credits toward reduction of sentence was improperly presented because that was an issue for parole and sentence was not ex post facto law where he voluntary accepted plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A building was heavily damaged in a fire. Notice was sent to the former owner to repair or tear down the structure. When there was no response the city tore down the structure and filed an action to collect its costs against the owner at the time of the fire and the owner that had purchased the property on the day the notice was sent. Both sides sought summary judgment. The court determined that the defendants were liable to the city for all costs incurred although those costs exceeded the value of the property. The statute under which the city filed its action, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:48 1.1, was reasonably adopted to assist municipalities in dealing with the financial burden of abating public nuisances and was therefore constitutional. The court also determined that both the former and current owners were liable because they were close corporations and when the former owner received notice the current owner also constructively received notice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court entered judgment in favor of the city and found both the current and former owners of the property liable for the city's full demolition costs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court found no rational basis for the arbitrary exclusion of certain classes of public employees within the statute.

The state registrar refused to issue the certificate, alleging that the statute did not permit such change for persons born outside the United States. Upon plaintiffs' motion to enforce the judgment, the trial court held that the provision in the judgment ordering the issuance of the birth certificate was in error, and a second judgment was entered without the provision. Upon plaintiffs' second motion, alleging that the statute violated the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution, the trial court held that good cause was not shown as to why the recorded place of birth should be changed. The court affirmed, holding that &sect; 26:8-40.1 was clear in requiring a proof of good cause before a court could order the recorded change in the adopted person's place of birth.

Defendant municipality enacted a rent leveling ordinance effective November 1974. In 1974 and 1975, defendant tenant signed one-year renewal leases. The ordinance was pre-empted in June 1976 by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which set the maximum allowable rent on defendant tenant's apartment at $ 785 per month. Defendant tenant then entered into a two-year lease at a monthly rent of $ 870. Defendant tenant filed a complaint with defendant municipality's Rent Leveling Board. The board determined that plaintiff owed defendant tenant a refund of $ 2,178 for excessive rents paid under the 1971-1974 step-up lease. On appeal, the trial judge affirmed and awarded $ 4,498. On further appeal, the court determined that the ordinance was intended to operate only at the expiration of leases in existence when it was enacted. The award of $ 2,178 was erroneous.

Plaintiff brought a summary dispossess action against defendants, because he wanted to eliminate the ground-floor apartment and expand the tavern in the building.

The court held that the enactment of subsection (h) was a reasonable exercise of the state's police power in protecting residential tenants from a critical shortage of rental housing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a resident at a state neuropsychiatric institute. The state charged him under the fourth and fifth counts of a five-count indictment with carnal knowledge of two female residents of that institution, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A: 138-2. Defendant contended that the statute was unconstitutional. The lower court held that the statute was unconstitutional and dismissed the fourth and fifth counts of the state's indictment. The state sought interlocutory review of the decision. On appeal, the lower court's order was reversed and the fourth and fifth counts of the indictment were reinstated. The appellate court held that the statutory classification's distinction between males and females was subject to scrutiny but was constitutional because it served an important governmental in protecting institutionalized feebleminded or mentally ill females, and because the prohibition of sexual intercourse with such persons, who may not fully comprehend the significance or consequences of such conduct, was substantially related to the achievement of that protection.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the agreement allowed recovery from the date it was entered.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, Commissioner of Department of Insurance, appealed from a judgment of the Law Division (New Jersey) declaring the provisions of N.J Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:22-6.6a and &sect; 17B:22-8(c) unconstitutional as violative of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17:22-6.6a prohibited defendant, the Commissioner of Department of Insurance, from renewing the insurance license of any agent or broker that was affiliated with a financial institution. Exclusions in the statute enabled lending institutions engaged in the business of providing certain types of insurance to apply for and renew requisite licenses. Lending institutions engaged in the business of providing any other type of insurance were expressly denied the privilege of being issued or renewing any licenses. A second exception provided that finance companies affiliated with insurance companies were not subjected to the statutory prohibition, but all finance companies not affiliated with insurance companies were prohibited from engaging in the insurance business. Similar language was adopted at N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 17B:22-8(c). Plaintiffs, who were agents or brokers, were notified that their licenses would not be renewed because they were in some way affiliated with a financial institution. The court held that the legislation was constitutionally invalid because of the absence of a logical basis for exclusions made by the legislature in the body of the statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, finding the statutes to be unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clauses of the federal and state constitutions. The legislature, without rational justification, chose to exempt some persons from a classification to which they logically and fairly belonged. Such statutory underinclusiveness was appropriately found to be so arbitrary as to deny equal protection.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The public advocate instituted suit on behalf of himself, and others, as plaintiffs, in the lower court against county municipalities challenging the legality of their land use plans and ordinances and seeking, among other things, injunctive and declaratory relief. The complaint in that action alleged that defendants, each a developing municipality, adopted land use plans and ordinances which arbitrarily exclude or substantially hinder the development of housing within their borders for low and moderate-income families. The court affirmed the decision of the public advocate to have instituted an action in the lower court, on behalf of himself and others, because the decision to litigate was obviously not in any way irrational, arbitrary or capricious. It was, rather, an altogether reasonable exercise by the public advocate of the discretion given him by the legislature to authorize the institution of litigation on behalf of a broad public interest under N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant storeowner appealed an interlocutory order that denied his motion to suppress books, magazines, and films that were seized from his store. Defendant was charged with violating N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:115-2, by uttering, or possessing with intent to utter or expose such materials. The court reversed the order. The court agreed with defendant's claim that the search warrant under which the material was seized was constitutionally defective. The court first ruled that the affidavit in support of the warrant did not provide a sufficient basis for its issuance. The court observed that the affidavit lacked a factual basis in that it contained only general descriptions of the contents of magazines and several titles without relating such descriptions to particular books or magazines. The court also ruled that that the warrant itself was invalid as it suffered from vagueness and overbreadth. Specifically, the warrant authorized seizure of &quot;obscene&quot; and &quot;lewd and indecent&quot; material. Such terms, the court ruled, were not sufficiently definite so that the officer executing the warrant could identify the property sought with reasonable certainty.</SPAN></P>

The materials were seized pursuant to a constitutionally defective warrant, in that the supporting affidavit did not provide sufficient basis for the warrant and the warrant itself did not describe with sufficient particularity the items to be seized. The materials were not per se contraband.</SPAN></P>

The amendment repealed the tax surcharge provision and required &quot;substantial compliance&quot; with the property maintenance code as a condition precedent to an increase in rents in the action brought by plaintiff taxpayer corporations and individuals. The court found that the basic inquiry in reviewing any rent control scheme was to determine whether it permitted an efficient landlord to realize a just and reasonable return on his property The court held that the rent control insofar as it repealed the pre-existing tax surcharge passthrough provision, was facially constitutional and valid, the Tenants' Property Tax Rebate Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-6.2, neither preempted the field of municipal rent control nor prevented repeal of tax surcharges allowed incident thereto, and the substantial compliance provisions of the rent control ordinance were not facially invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff injured individual claimed damages as the result of defective equipment supplied by defendant corporations. Defendants were incorporated in Illinois, neither was registered to do business in New Jersey, and each was constitutionally amenable to long-arm service of process under N.J. Ct.

The trial court granted defendants' motions to dismiss, holding that &sect; 2A:14-2, was unconstitutional as applied to defendants. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court, finding that &sect; 2A:14-22, did not offend U.S. Const. amend. XIV. There was a reasonable basis for a distinction between the application of the tolling statute as to foreign corporations represented in the state and as to those not so represented, as service on a represented foreign corporation could be easy compared to service on an unrepresented foreign corporation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoners sought review from final decisions of respondent New Jersey Department of Corrections for refusing to grant them work credits toward parole eligibility for their time spent on death row.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoners sought review of respondent department of correction's decision to refuse appellants' work credits for time spent on death row. The court rejected appellants' claim that case law mandated the grant despite not working while on death row because appellants were not entitled to work credits for work they did not perform. The legislature intended the grant of work credit predicated on a prisoner's actual performance of work, which applied despite there being good reasons for not working. Appellants' contention that respondent's policy of denying death row inmates work credit was violative of the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV was rejected. Such a policy was subject to rational basis scrutiny that existed by distinguishing between death row prisoners and others. The punishment's finality foreclosed any notion of rehabilitation and justified the need to accord different treatment through segregation to prisoners sentenced to death. Those prisoners did not work, and were not entitled to work credits. Appellants did not meet the threshold for equal protection analysis: to demonstrate disparate treatment among members of the same class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decisions of respondent department of corrections to refuse to grant work credits to appellants prisoners for the time spent on death row because case law did not intend to alter legislative policy that work credit was based upon actual work performed. Moreover, such a policy was not violative of equal protection rights because the policy was subject to rational basis scrutiny.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant medical device provider sought review of a decision of respondent Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (New Jersey), which denied him status as an eligible Medicaid provider of orthotic services based on N.J. Admin. Code tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 55-1.1, 1.2. He challenged the denial claiming the regulation exceeded respondent's rule-making power and because it unconstitutionally delegated government authority to a private agency.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant medical device provider was denied certification as an eligible Medicaid provider of orthotic services based on his lack of certification by the American Board of Certification in Orthotics and Prosthetics, Inc. (ABC) in orthotics, as provided by N.J. Admin. Code tit. 10, &sect;&sect; 55-1.1, 1.2. He contended that the certification requirement exceeded respondent Division of Medical Assistance and Health Service's rule making authority, and that it was an unconstitutional delegation of power to a private agency. The court disposed of the first argument finding that it was a syllogistic turn on state licensing requirements, but the regulation complained of was not a licensing requirement, but rather was an attempt to set up objective criteria for guaranteeing that public money was well spent. On the second argument, the court held that the delegation to a private company for certification purposes was not per se unreasonable, but the record was inadequate for the purpose of review. Accordingly, the court remanded to respondent for limited proceedings on the nature and character of ABC, with further briefs to be submitted. The court retained jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that respondent division had not exceeded its rule making authority in establishing criteria for Medicaid providers of orthotics devices, but that the legitimacy of the process required further briefing because respondent had delegated some of the reasonable certification requirement to a private company. The absence in the record of information about the company required a remand and further briefing.</SPAN></P>

Respondent labor department brought an action before the Commissioner of Labor and Industry to have appellant declared ineligible for public works contracts. The court affirmed the decision of the Commissioner in favor of respondent and found that although the Prevailing Wage Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 34:11-56.25, et seq., did not seem to require intentional violations in order to be barred from receiving government contracts, appellants repeated violations raised an inference of intent or flagrant disregard rising to the level of intent that would justify being debarred. The court found that appellant's debarment did not violate due process because the Act did not confer any property rights upon appellant sufficient to meet the threshold due process requirements. The court found that although the debarment clause of the Act appeared to be mandatory on its face, and, thus, susceptible to producing arbitrary results, application of the provision was left to the discretion of the Commissioner and under these facts its application was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee candidate filed a complaint with the Election Law Enforcement Commission which alleged that appellants, political committee and its members, violated the Campaign Contributions and Expenditures Act, N.J.

Appellee argued that appellants did not report the expenditures for the advertisements as required by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 19:44A-10 and 19:44A-12. The Election Law Commission ruled in favor of appellee, and appellants sought review, arguing that they were not constitutionally subject to the requirements of N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were found guilty in municipal court of violating the ordinance requiring snow and ice removal within a specified period of time after the snow fell or the ice formed. Defendants sought review by trial de novo in the county court, and the latter affirmed the conviction. Defendants appealed, arguing that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague and the penalty permitted excessive. The court affirmed, after finding that there were no New Jersey cases on point, by relying on the fact that such ordinances had been upheld elsewhere as a valid exercise of the police power. The court held that contrary to defendants' argument, an ordinance was not invalid merely because it imposed a burden on some citizens necessary for the public good. The court held that as applied to defendants under the evidence adduced, the ordinance was not vague. The court also rejected defendants' argument that the penalty provided by the ordinance, a fine up to $ 500 and imprisonment of up to 90 days for each successive day of noncompliance, was excessive, because the penalty was statutorily authorized and in any event defendants were fined only $ 5.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent Division of Public Welfare terminated appellant recipient's welfare benefits because a VISTA stipend increased her monthly income. Appellant contended that the termination was a violation of 42 U.S.C.S.&sect; 5044(g), which exempted such payments from welfare income calculations. Respondent contended that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 44:8-107 et seq. delegated responsibility to the municipalities and that N.J. Admin. Code tit. 10:85, &sect; 3.3(e)(1)(ii), was not preempted because the general assistance program received no federal funds. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the federal statute superseded the contrary provision of the New Jersey general assistance regulation. The extent of federal financial participation in the totality of the welfare scheme was so pervasive, substantial, and so ultimately ameliorative of the state's traditional obligations in that area of governmental service that the limited component of that scheme maintained by the state alone was not fairly regarded as the performance of a sovereign function under U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, civil service and police training commissions, brought a declaratory action against appellant general assembly, challenging special legislation waiving civil service merit and fitness qualifications for certain individuals to civil service positions. The trial court granted appellees' motion for judgment on the pleadings, finding that the legislation violated N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, para. 9(5). On appeal, the court vacated the judgment and determined that the trial court's decision was void, because it should have dismissed appellees' complaint on the grounds that the action did not present a justiciable controversy where there was present a viable statute affecting the rights or status of appellees. Rather, the court held that appellees improperly sought to have the trial court provide an advisory opinion that future legislation of the same type would not be constitutional. The court further held that appellees had not sought timely review of any of the numerous statutes of the type they found objectionable.</SPAN></P>

When the officer radioed for an investigative check on the car's registration, he was told that the car had been stolen. While arresting defendants for possession of a stolen motor vehicle, defendants insisted that the car was not stolen. The officer began to search the car for personal identification of defendants, and discovered capsules and tablets in the glove compartment of the automobile. After returning to the station, the officer requested that the status of the vehicle be checked more carefully. He was advised that one defendant owned the car, that he had reported the car as stolen, but that it had been returned to him, and the report had not been cancelled. The trial court granted defendants' motions to suppress the evidence found in the glove compartment, and the state appealed the order. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the search was justified as incidental to a valid arrest.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendant appealed from the trial court's judgment, following a conviction for assault with intent to commit sodomy, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:90-2. He contended that the trial judge erred in precluding affirmative evidence or cross-examination on the alleged victim's consensual participation. The court reversed the conviction, finding that consensual participation was a valid defense. The court reasoned that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:110-1, which criminalized sodomy between consenting adults, was an unconstitutional exercise of the state's police power, so that defendant had a right to investigate that area. The court rejected the state's argument that the ruling was harmless, because the conviction was based on assault, which precluded consent. The court found that the trial court's instruction made the holding of assault contingent on the jury's finding non-consensual sodomy. The court also found that defendant was permitted to probe the victim's alleged drug use at the new trial, as use of drugs had a potential effect on the victim's ability to perceive and recall.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision because the commonality of the proposed expenditures was not in compliance with the single subject rule of N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, para. 3. The single subject rule prohibited the packaging of disparate objects or works into a single proposition submitted to the voters for a single vote. The court held that the construction of a building, or buildings, without advice concerning the use of the building was not an appropriate legislative object because the law was too general and obtained voter approval without limit as to its multiple purposes in violation of the constitution.</SPAN></P>

The alleged contempts occurred at the hearing on the motion for reconsideration of counsel fees. Appellant contended before the judge of compensation that a fee representing approximately 11 percent of the compensation award was inadequate. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment as to counsel and witness fees. The adjudication and imposition of sentence for the contempts of appellant were reversed and vacated for lack of jurisdiction. The court found that the administrative tribunal was incompetent to adjudge the contempt.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, Division of Youth and Family Services sought an investigative order. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:4C-12 permitted plaintiff to apply for an investigative order where it had previously requested the parents to allow an investigation into the conditions and care of a child, but has been refused. The statute implied a complaint from an outside agency or concerned citizen which plaintiff has a duty to investigate. There had been no such complaint in this case. Plaintiff was on its own motion, seeking to investigate the circumstances of this child. The sole fact upon which plaintiff relied was the judicial finding 22 months prior to the date of this hearing that defendants were incapable of parenting their children. Thus, the mere coming before the court, citing a conclusionary fact without evidentiary facts to sustain that conclusion, was insufficient. Plaintiff's application for the issuance of an order requiring investigation was denied without prejudice.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The application was denied was because there had been no new facts presented by plaintiff upon which to find probable cause for the investigative order.</SPAN></P>

The new method, enacted by &sect; 29 of the Public School Education Act of 1975, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 18A:13-23, required that budget allocation be apportioned according to equalized valuations or ratables in each community. Section 18A:23.1 called for a gradual, five-year phase-in of the &sect; 29 basis of cost-sharing. Plaintiffs, municipalities and constituent members of regional school districts, challenged the interim phase-in of &sect; 18A:13-23.1 as unconstitutional arguing that the retention of the per pupil basis for allocation of budget appropriations violated the constitutional mandate requiring the state to provide a thorough and efficient system of education. The court affirmed the trial court's refusal to enjoin enforcement of &sect; 29 and held that &sect; 29 was constitutional and a manifestly reasonable exercise of legislative power beyond the ambit of judicial interference.</SPAN></P>

Respondent filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that petitioner's claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The Division of Workers' Compensation dismissed petitioner's claim, and she appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the petition was barred by the statute of limitations pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 34:15-51which provided that workers' compensation claims were to be filed within two years after the date of the employee's accident. The court held that every rational inference from the facts and circumstances of the decedent's accident was that he died on or about the date of his disappearance and that petitioner's contention that she would have been precluded from bringing any action prior to the expiration of the seven year period for unexplainable absence was without merit. Also without merit was petitioner's contention that &sect; 34:15-51 was unconstitutional because it was not tolled until her minor son's adulthood.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with and convicted of selling obscene materials and with conspiracy to sell obscene materials. The court modified the judgment, vacating the substantive convictions because the indictment failed to charge scienter where it specified only that defendants unlawfully sold obscene materials. The court affirmed the conspiracy convictions, holding that the indictment sufficiently charged scienter where it charged that defendants conspired willfully to sell obscene materials. This language sufficiently communicated to defendants a charge of intentional conspiracy to effect the sale of obscene materials, and by plainest implication it connoted that defendants knew of the nature and character of the material conspired to be sold. The court rejected defendants' contention that the prosecution failed to prove the three Miller elements of obscenity: defendants did not contend that the films had serious value; expert testimony was not needed to show that the films appealed to the prurient interest where the films were admitted into evidence; and the prosecution showed that the films violated local state community standards.</SPAN></P>

When it was dissatisfied with the decision from the Board of Public Utility Commissioners, appellant sought a de novo judicial review. Appellant claimed the rates were confiscatory. The court held that it lacked the power to conduct a de novo review, it could only determine whether the rates set by the board were reasonable. The claim of confiscation could only be upheld if the court found the rate of return was illegally arrived at. In determining the reasonableness of the rates, the court examined the company's rate base, its income and expenses, and the rate of return. The court found no merit to appellant's contention that the board denied rate relief for predetermined reasons unrelated to the merits of its application. In deferring to the board's expertise, the court found a sufficient record to support the board's decision.

Defendant township appealed. The court held that zoning was a municipal function which carried a strong presumption of validity. Defendant township was not required to provide for every use within its borders. The court was unwilling to hold as a matter of law, that the ordinance was invalid because it prohibited such reasonable use of an acceptable mode of housing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer moved in state and thereafter sold stock. After the stock sale, the legislature passed a statute authorizing a capital gains tax, N.J. Stat.

Appellant paid the tax under protest, then filed a claim for a refund, which was denied. He claimed that he sold the stock while a state resident in reliance on the non-existence of a capital gains tax, and would not have sold the stock had the tax been in effect. Appellant filed suit against respondents, tax division and officials, claiming that the statute was unconstitutional as applied retroactively to his case. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision of respondents, finding that at the time appellant sold his shares of corporate stock he should have been aware that the legislature was seriously considering some form of income tax which, if enacted, would have probably conformed to the generally accepted practice of making a tax law applicable, beginning usually on January 1, to that part of the year which preceded its enactment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parties were divorced in New York several years earlier. The mother was awarded custody of the children, but on an informal basis, had surrendered custody to the father. Both parties were living in New Jersey when the father petitioned the court for child support. The mother argued that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:4-18(e), (f) compelled support by a husband but made no similar provision for a mother to support her children. The father contended that &sect; 2A:4-18(b) authorized the court with the same power as the superior court to order support from a former wife. The court declined to address the father's argument that the statute was discriminatory and unconstitutional because it could base its decision on other grounds. The court found that &sect; 2A:4-18(e), (f) did not apply because the parties were divorced and there was no desertion. Because the superior court had recognized that parents shared an equal duty to support their children, the court found that its concurrent jurisdiction under &sect; 2A:4-18(b) permitted it to order a wife to pay child support. Denying the mother's motion to dismiss the father's complaint, the court ordered a hearing on whether support should be awarded.</SPAN></P>

The tax court found that the parcels were entitled to farmland assessment under the Farmland Assessment Act of 1964 (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:4-23.1 et seq. The tax court also valued the land at $ 720 an acre, based on a finding that the land was &quot;cropland harvested.&quot; Respondent township challenged the finding of farmland assessment and petitioner challenged the valuation. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision that the parcels were entitled to farmland assessment and reversed the valuation and remanded to the tax court for a hearing on the appropriate valuation. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that the parcels were devoted to agricultural use as defined under the Act and that respondent had failed to meet its burden of overcoming the presumptive constitutionality of the Act.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient sought review of a final order of commitment of respondent county, entered by the Essex County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court (New Jersey) pursuant to N.J. Ct. R. 4:74-7(f), involuntarily committing appellant to the county hospital on a finding that appellant was dangerous to herself and others as a result of mental illness. Appellant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support an involuntary commitment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient was involuntarily committed to the county hospital after a hearing at which the only witness was a psychiatrist who testified that appellant was potentially dangerous to others because she suffered from mood swings that compromised her judgment and caused her to act impulsively. While appellant's appeal was pending, she was discharged from the hospital. Respondent county argued that the discharge mooted the appeal, and that the evidence was sufficient to support the involuntary commitment. The court reversed. Discharge of appellant did not moot her appeal because serious collateral legal consequences stemmed from the commitment order, in that respondent filed a lien against appellant's property to secure payment for the care and maintenance of appellant during her confinement for which appellant would not be liable if her confinement were improper. The psychiatrist's opinion that appellant was &quot;potentially dangerous to others&quot; was insufficient to establish the legally-required likelihood that, by reason of her mental illness, appellant would constitute a danger to others or herself if not confined.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order involuntarily committing appellant patient to respondent county's hospital was reversed. The appeal was not mooted by appellant's discharge from the hospital while the appeal was pending. Evidence that appellant was mentally ill, without additional evidence that the illness caused appellant to be a danger to herself or others, was insufficient to support an involuntary commitment order.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied defendants' motion that the systematic exclusion of full-time students and the under-representation of certain groups from the grand jury violated their rights to due process and equal protection and under N.J.

The court affirmed, holding that full-time students were not a &quot;cognizable group&quot; the exclusion of which would rob a grand jury of its cross-sectional quality. The court found that the exclusion of students did not target a large portion of the population, was rationally warranted to protect students from the hardships of jury duty, and was not an invidious discrimination based on race, color, creed, national origin, ancestry, matrimonial status or sex. The court further found that the failure to update voter registration lists as required by N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 19:31-15 that were used to select grand jurors had no relationship to the under-representation of women, blacks, laborers and blue-collar workers and that any such disparity did not result from intentional discrimination, but rather from the use of voter registration lists and individualized excuses.</SPAN></P>

Defendants moved to suppress the evidence seized in a warrantless search. The trial judge ordered suppression of the evidence and held that the Motor Vehicle Act, N.J. Stat.

The state contended that the trial court erred in deciding that the two Chevrolet Blazers were motor vehicles and argued that &sect; 39:10-6 did not apply to private property. On appeal, the court affirmed the order suppressing the evidence relating to the inoperable Blazer, but reversed the order relating to the operable Blazer.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the municipal court of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), speeding, and disregarding a traffic signal. Defendant appealed. A trial de novo was held in the trial court. The trial court sustained the defendant's DUI conviction, but reversed his convictions for speeding and disregard of a traffic signal. Defendant had argued, for the first time on appeal, that the municipal court lacked jurisdiction because N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:97-1, which established the municipal court, was unconstitutional. Plaintiff state appealed. The issue on appeal was whether the municipal court had jurisdiction to decide defendants' case de novo on the theory of de facto jurisdiction where no objection to the municipal court's authority was raised in the municipal court. The court noted that the municipal court was an inferior court that developed from laws pertaining to police courts and camp meeting associations. The court concluded that the municipal court was validly established, thus had jurisdiction to enforce state statutes prescribing motor vehicle operation. The trial court judgment of acquittal in the DUI was reversed. The case was remanded for resentencing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, taxpayers, black residents, low-income families of Essex County, and the City of Newark, brought a class action suit alleging that the state system of financing welfare and judiciary-administration functions through state-mandated costs imposed upon the counties, to be met through local realty taxes resulted in a denial of equal protection, violated the principle of uniformity of taxation, and negated an &quot;implicit premise of local government.&quot; The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint and stated that the system of state-mandated costs at issue was not unconstitutional. Plaintiffs challenged the trial court' s judgment. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that there were no equal protection violations because there was a rational basis for counties to bear a share of the costs in question. Likewise, the court held that uniformity of taxation was faithfully followed, as the fiscal responsibilities of these costs had been uniformly levied upon all taxable property. Also, the counties' rights to self-government and to be free of any unwarranted distribution of the state's fiscal responsibility were not violated by these statutory cost schemes.</SPAN></P>

Respondent denied parole, finding that each was ineligible under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 30:4-123.35. Defendants appealed, and the court affirmed. The statute provided that no county prisoner was to be eligible for parole until incarcerated for at least one year; that eligibility was further limited to inmates whose sentences might have been served in state prison; and that parole was not intended to be available to county inmates serving disorderly person sentences of six months. It held that county inmates sentenced to consecutive sentences, where each sentence had a term of at least one year, were eligible for parole upon completion of the aggregated minimum sentence, or one-third of the aggregated maximum term; that parole eligibility would not arise until after at least one full year; and that different treatment of county and state prison inmates was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were convicted of knowingly selling obscene material to a person under the age of 18, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:115-1.8. Defendants appealed, arguing the trial court erroneously failed to instruct the jury that the prosecution had to prove that defendants knew or should have known the age of the minor. The court found that the prosecution was not required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants knew or should have known from his appearance that the buyer of the obscene material was under 18 years of age. The trial court did not err in refusing to submit defendants' instruction to the jury because the instruction would have permitted the jury to acquit based on a finding that the prosecution failed to affirmatively prove that defendants knew the minor's age. Because the requested charge in part misstated the law, the trial judge properly rejected it in its entirety. Regardless, any error in refusing the charge was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the fact that the minor appeared to be over 18 years old was not alone a defense to the crime. Further, there was no claim that defendants did not know the minor's age. Defendants' convictions were thus affirmed.</SPAN></P>

At a hearing before the Appeal Tribunal of respondent Board of Review for the state's Department of Labor and Industry, upon advice of counsel appellant refused to answer questions about her country origin, her citizenship, and her right to work in the United States, on the assertion that the questions were irrelevant to her availability for work and unconstitutional.

On appeal, the court held that where legislation generally served a proper public purpose, facial invalidation of the entire legislation should be avoided where feasible and the legislation judicially construed to narrow or expand its effect to erase the unconstitutional aspect. Accepting the trial court's finding as to the chilling effect upon groups who collected or spent small sums of money to influence legislation, the court adopted a threshold annual limitation of $ 750 for reporting requirements.

Nor did the court find it necessary that a particular tax revenue be included in the equalization process.

Further, the court found that it was the legislature's intention that published official notices come to the attention of as wide and diverse a readership as possible. Application of the reasonable relation test established the nexus between the challenged criteria and the advancement of a valid legislative purpose. Thus, the classification that plaintiff challenged was not shown to be arbitrary, capricious or unrelated to the specific objective of the legislation. Therefore, the trial court's judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The statute that plaintiff challenged was constitution because there was a reasonable relation between the challenged criteria and the advancement of a valid legislative purpose.</SPAN></P>

The mother of the child had lived with the child in the grandmother's home for about two years after the child's birth. The mother then moved to New York and lived there until her death, but the mother left the child with the grandmother out of concern for the child's welfare. The father of the child admitted to paternity of the child six months after the child's birth and was ordered to pay child support. The father visited the child at the grandmother's home, but his visits became less frequent after the mother left the home. The court held that the father could not be denied custody by virtue of his status as an unwed father under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 9: 2 -13 or 9: 3-18. Further, the court denied the grandparents' petition for adoption in the absence of consent by the father, because he had not forsaken his parental obligations under N.J. Stat.

However, the court granted custody to the grandparents with liberal visitation rights to the father, because it would be psychologically detrimental to remove him from his home since birth.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court denied plaintiff pensioner's motion for an order to declare that a suit that he filed on the behalf of pensioners, whose checks were subject to allegedly illegal deductions by defendant pension commission, was maintainable as a class action. The trial court also granted defendant's summary judgment motion and dismissed the complaint. The court reversed the denial of plaintiff's motion for certification of the action as a class on appeal, and directed the trial court to hold a hearing as to whether the action qualified for that treatment. The court found that the fact that plaintiff was the only pensioner who filed a claim regarding the deductions at issue did not preclude the certification, and that the determining factor was whether his claim was typical of those of the individuals that he sought to represent. The court also determined that any individual who did not wish to be represented in the litigation could always have opted out of the class. The court further held that plaintiff's case relied on interpreting the pension statute, which was a question of law that was common to all members of the class.</SPAN></P>

The court held that plaintiffs had standing because the contested legislation could significantly affect plaintiffs, as property owners, and others similarly situated.

The court found that it was clear that the partition proceeding was designed and pursued by defendants solely to circumvent the subdivision statute and the allegedly onerous conditions imposed upon the proposed subdivision of defendants' property by plaintiff's resolution. The court found that the partition judgment was entered without plaintiff having the benefit of a hearing, and that the judgment was unsupported by any evidence that would justify the partition. The court found that the final order, which was drafted with the consent of defendants, divided the property in exactly the manner sought in the subdivision application.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Union County, which affirmed the decision of the municipal court in a trial de novo and found defendant guilty of leaving the scene of an accident with complainant despite defendant's claim that he had no knowledge of the accident.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant driver was found guilty in municipal court of leaving the scene of an accident with complainant. A motion for judgment of acquittal was denied. After a trial de novo defendant was found guilty by the county court. On appeal the court held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-129(b) should have been construed to require proof of knowledge of involvement in an accident in a prosecution for leaving the scene. The absence of the word &quot;knowingly&quot; from the law was not construed as intent to create a strict liability offense. The state produced evidence of an accident and defendant's failure to stop. Defendant denied knowledge of any impact. The trial judge assessed the probative force of the inference of defendant's knowledge of the accident that arose once the state proved that an impact occurred. The trial judge held that the probative weight of the inference of knowledge that arose from proof of impact outweighed the probative force of defendant's denial of knowledge and found defendant guilty. The court affirmed as there was sufficient evidence to support the trial judge's finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant left the scene of an accident contrary to the statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge was within his authority when he believed the inference of knowledge due to the impact over the defendant's denial of knowledge.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the convictions because defendant failed to show that he was a member of a suspect class therefore the standard that the trial court applied to decide on the issue of constitutionality was appropriate. The rational relationship test was properly used to determine the issue of constitutionality of the statute. The compelling state interest test was applicable in situations where there was a showing that there was a suspect classification.

Ann. &sect; 52:10B-6, that imposed a one-year residency requirement in the senatorial district from which a state senator sought election as a condition to membership in the state senate, to be unconstitutional. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the constitutional and statutory residency requirement for the office of state senator filled a compelling state need and was rationally related to legitimate state objectives. The court reasoned that other statutes that required a longer residency requirement had been found to be constitutional with the United States Supreme Court. The court concluded that art IV, &sect; I, para. 2 was constitutional and defendant's name was to be stricken off the primary election ballot.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed on several grounds, urging vacation of their convictions and sentences. The court affirmed the trial judgment. Defendants criticized the &quot;judicial engraftment&quot; of the Miller test on L. 1971, c. 449, that the grand jury was not presented with any evidence of the charge that one defendant violated N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:115-2, and that the indictment should be dismissed for failing to set forth that they had scienter regarding the character and content of the obscene materials, among others. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that defendants' criticism regarding the &quot;judicial engraftment&quot; of the Miller test was disregarded. The construction given the statute satisfied the Miller test's requirement that the prohibited hardcore sexual conduct be specifically defined by the applicable state law, as written. Supporting evidence in the form of testimony and actual magazines purchased unquestionably met the Miller test's requirements and were sufficient to support the charge.

Ann. &sect; 12A:2-101 et seq., in that they provided consumers with broader remedies than those available under the UCC. The court found that remedies in the UCC were intended to give stability to the law of commercial transactions, but did not purport to limit the police power. The court found the regulations a proper exercise of police power. It also rejected plaintiffs' argument that the regulations created an invalid, unconstitutional classification. Because the majority of the complaints concerned pet dealers, that fact was sufficient support for the classification and provided a reasonable basis for the classification that was not purely arbitrary. Thus, no invidious discrimination existed in the regulations. Finally, the court found the regulations were not invidiously vague, and that they did not prohibit the sale of mixed breed animals.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant trucking company sought review of the judgment of the Burlington County Court (New Jersey), which convicted defendant of carrying a load in excess of the weight permitted for that type of vehicle, pursuant to the provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-84.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant trucking company was charged on two separate occasions when a truck it owned was found to be carrying a load in excess of the weight permitted for that type of vehicle pursuant to the provisions of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:3-84. After a hearing in municipal court, defendant was found guilty as charged and fined for each offense. Defendant was again found guilty on a trial de novo on the record. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court held that the statute specifying both the amount of allowable weight as well as the method by which compliance was determined was not unconstitutionally vague. Defendant's construction of the statute was unacceptable and productive of confusion of statutory language that the court found clear. If the distances referred to simply measured axle length, the legislature could have said so, without resorting to the device of the distance between two parallel transverse vertical planes to measure permissible axle weight.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee filed a complaint with respondent New Jersey Department of Civil Service when a veteran was appointed over her to a position in which she had performed temporarily for three years and received the highest score in a competitive examination for the position. Respondent dismissed appellant's complaint, finding that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 11:27-4 mandated the appointment of veteran whenever he is among those certified. Appellant then sought review of respondent's decision, arguing that &sect; 11:27-4 was unconstitutional in granting veteran's an absolute preference to state positions. The court held that &sect; 11:27-4 was not inconsistent with N.J. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1, para. 2 because that constitutional provision gave the basis for the state's veteran's preference laws. The court also held that the due process and equal protection clauses in U.S. Const. amend. XIV were not violated by &sect; 11:27-4 because the statute was neither arbitrary, capricious, nor unreasonable and bore a rational relationship to the state's legitimate objective of providing a preference to veterans and because the award of benefits on the basis of veteran's status had not involved a suspect class.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the Morris County Court (New Jersey), which affirmed defendant's conviction for violating the disorderly persons offense of tampering with an electric meter, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:170-64. Defendant claimed that that the presumptive evidence provision of &sect; 2A:170-64 was unconstitutional and that his conviction should have been set aside.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After an electric company meter reader found that the outdoor meter on defendant's house was upside down so that the meter ran backwards, defendant was convicted of the disorderly persons offense of tampering with an electric meter, in violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:170-64. The conviction was affirmed in a de novo trial. Defendant appealed, claiming that a part of &sect; 2A:170-64, which permitted the existence of certain conditions of the electric meter to constitute presumptive evidence of intent to defraud, was unconstitutional. The court affirmed and held that by applying the inference in &sect; 2A:170-64 to the facts, it was able to conclude that it was more likely than not that defendant tampered with the meter with fraudulent intent. Such an inference was rational when tested by human conduct and experience, for the only person who was usually motivated to tamper with a meter was the one who would profit financially from such tampering. Accordingly, &sect; 2A:170-64 met the constitutional challenge. Because there was sufficient evidence of tampering to support the application of the presumptive evidence rule, defendant was properly convicted.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's judgment that defendant was properly convicted of the disorderly persons offense of tampering with an electric meter. The court held that the condition of the electric meter met the statutory presumption of evidence of defendant's intent to defraud. Because the presumption was proper and constitutional, defendant's conviction was proper.</SPAN></P>
