The court held: (1) the presiding judge had the authority to appoint himself as a district judge for the purposes of conducting jury selection under Alaska Stat. &sect; 22.10.130 because there was nothing in Alaska Const. art. IV, &sect; 16, which established an exclusive procedure for assignments of judges within the courts; (2) there was no error in the substitution of judges after the jury was sworn; (3) while the trial court did not follow Alaska R. Crim. P. 24 during jury selection, there was no prejudice to defendants, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion under Alaska R. Crim. P. 53 in relaxing Alaska R. Crim. P. 24(d) and (e); (4) the trial court did not err in not disqualifying jurors who previously sat in on an OMVI case; and (5) the use of a striking system did not violate equal protection because of established procedures to alleviate the problem of a large docket and every OMVI case was treated equally.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, in which he was convicted of possession of cocaine, pursuant to Alaska Stat. &sect; 17.10.010, and sentenced to 21 months' imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in admitting certain evidence and imposed an excessive sentence. The court affirmed, holding that a police officer's raising defendant's cocaine snifter, a highly suspicious object, to a streetlight at night did not constitute an unreasonable search as the residue was visible in the daylight, and thus, the officer's actions in examining the snifter were not an expansion of the search. The court determined that the officer properly searched defendant for weapons incident to his arrest and that defendant's resistance could not have been construed as the exercise of a constitutional right to resist an unlawful search, but was relevant to show defendant's knowledge that he possessed cocaine. The court found that fair-minded jurors could have differed on the questions of whether the State proved that defendant's possession of cocaine was committed with the knowledge that he possessed such and thus, the issue was properly submitted to the jury. The court concluded that the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal and considered at sentencing the evidence of defendant's subsequent possession of cocaine.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for violating Ketchikan, Alaska, Municipal Code &sect; 9.04.010, in that he was held to have repeatedly and continuously shouted and screamed in a loud voice and in a public place when he was refused service at a bar for not having proper identification. The judge instructed the jury but neglected to instruct them on the required element of intent. Defendant did not object to the instructions and the trial court convicted defendant. On appeal, the decision was affirmed. On appeal to the court, the conviction was reversed and remanded. The court held that although the instruction in question had not been objected to or previously raised on appeal, it was plain error for the trial judge to have failed to instruct that intent was a necessary element of the offense. The court held that setting forth the ordinance in the instructions had not eliminated the substantial confusion which the instructions created by not listing any element of intent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Third Judicial District, Anchorage, which convicted him of five counts of leaving the scene of an accident involving injury without stopping to render aid (failure to render aid), in violation of Alaska Stat. &sect;&sect; 28.35.050 and 28.35.060.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had several beers, drove his car, and caused a series of collisions that resulted in one person's death and injuries to four people. Defendant's trial was delayed and his indictment for manslaughter was dismissed. When defendant contemplated filing a motion to dismiss the indictments, the State advised that it was contemplating reindicting him for manslaughter. Defendant was convicted of five counts of failing to render aid under Alaska Stat. &sect; 28.35.060. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed, remanding with directions for defendant to have challenged the validity of his indictment. The court found that the lower court had not abused its discretion in rejecting defendant's alternative jury instruction. There was strong circumstantial evidence that the State may have asserted the prospect of an increased charge of manslaughter to have induced defendant to have refrained from challenging the indictments against him. The State's actions violated the due process standard, and that it was the objective appearance of a reasonable likelihood of vindictiveness, rather than actual malice or retaliatory motivation that controlled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment which convicted defendant for failure to render aid but remanded the cause to the lower court, with directions that defendant should have been permitted to challenge the validity of the indictment upon which he was convicted. The court did not retain jurisdiction upon remand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged a decision from the Superior Court of the State of Alaska, Anchorage, which convicted them of advancing a gambling game in violation of Anchorage, Alaska, Municipal Code &sect; 8.16.030, and permitting gambling on own premises in violation of Anchorage, Alaska, Municipal Code &sect; 8.16.040. Defendants claimed that the municipal provisions regulating gambling were unconstitutionally vague and violated equal protection and privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With warrants the Anchorage police entered the Polar Bar and arrested one of the defendants for conducting a gambling game in violation of Anchorage, Alaska, Mun. Code &sect; 8.16.030, and the owner of the Polar Bar for permitting gambling to take place in the bar in violation of Anchorage, Alaska, Mun. Code &sect; 8.15.040. Defendants were convicted as charged and the lower appellate court affirmed. Defendants claimed that they were not brought to trial within the 120-day period mandated by Alaska R. Crim. P. 45 and that the provisions under which they were convicted were unconstitutionally vague and violated equal protection and privacy. In affirming on appeal, the court held that: (1) the defendants were brought to trial within the required 120-day period, allowing for excluded periods attributable to motions to dismiss, and a motion made by one of the defendants for a continuance; (2) the ordinances were not overbroad, the definition of gambling under the ordinances was definite, and because what was regulated was conduct and not speech, the ordinances were within the city's authority to regulate; and (3) defendants did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in conducting gambling.</SPAN></P>
