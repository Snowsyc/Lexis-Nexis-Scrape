</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, entertainment corporation, sought review of a decree in equity from the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which enjoined appellant from conducting a performance known as the International Festival of Matadors and Bulls, an exhibition of American style bullfighting. Appellee, animal rights organization, brought an action to enjoin the performance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, animal rights organization, sought to enjoin a performance by appellant, entertainment corporation, known as the International Festival of Matadors and Bulls. The lower court found in favor of appellee. On appeal, the court held that the baiting and otherwise cruelly ill-treating aspects of the cruelty to animals statute (statute), 18 P.S. &sect; 4942, were susceptible to a wide sphere of interpretation. The court concluded that the performance did not fall within the exceptions to the general rule that equity would not enjoin the mere commission of a crime, and therefore equity could properly exercise its jurisdiction. The court determined that there was nothing in the statute that expressly gave appellee the power or authority to institute the action in equity nor would the court read into the statute something that was not written therein. The court found that appellee did not enjoy any greater property right in the prevention of such offenses and did not suffer injury to any greater degree than the general public when violations of the statute occurred. The court held that appellee had no standing and reversed the decree of the lower court.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellee, animal rights organization, had no standing under the cruelty to animals statute because appellee did not expressly have the power to institute the action, did not enjoy a greater property right in the prevention of such offenses, and did not suffer injury to any greater degree than the general public.</SPAN></P>

The state supreme court vacated the order, with leave to appellants to file preliminary objections within 30 days of the date of the filing of the opinion, pursuant to the Eminent Domain Code of 1964. Appellee averred that it had eminent domain authority by reason of the Natural Gas Companies Act, 15 P.S. &sect; 3549, which did not include any appeal procedure. The code displaced the courts of equity as the forum for condemnation matters. Section 604 of the code provided that within 30 days after service of the notice of condemnation, the condemnee may file preliminary objections to the declaration of taking. Section 901 of the code did preserve parts of the act.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a trust administration matter, the trustee claimed an interim commission on principal for ordinary services in the Orphans' Court of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The sole issue before the court was whether a trustee under a testamentary trust created prior to 1945, which was not an executor, could have received for its ordinary services as trustee an interim commission on principal. The court noted that, under prior law, where the same fiduciary was both executor and trustee and had received, for its ordinary services in both capacities, a commission on principal at the termination of its executorship, it could not have thereafter received an interim or an additional commission on principal for its ordinary services in its dual capacity. The court held that a situation where the corporate trustee was never an executor and had never received any compensation or commission on principal for its services, was clearly distinguishable and the broad language in earlier cases had to be limited to the facts therein. The court noted that there was no statute which directly and specifically prohibited an interim commission on principal for ordinary services under the facts presented and concluded that it should have allowed, if earned, the payment of a fair and reasonable interim commission on principal to a non-executor trustee of a long-term trust.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's decree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. His conviction was affirmed on appeal. He filed a petition for post conviction relief. The lower court denied his petition. He appealed from the denial, arguing that four coerced &quot;confessions&quot; were introduced at his trial. The court affirmed, holding that the trial counsel's failure to object to the confessions waived any claim for coerced confession. The trial counsel's deliberate bypass of the claim was imputed to appellant because there was no showing of incompetency or the presence of exceptional circumstances. Thus, the court noted that the trial counsel's decision not to attack the confession bound his client. However, the court held that there was an error in the computation of the effective date of appellant's sentence, which resulted in the imposition of a sentence for voluntary manslaughter which exceeded the statutory maximum. The court held that appellant was clearly entitled to credit for the time served after imposition of sentence and before the supersedeas was granted. Credit was also allowed for the ten day period prior to the grant of bail.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court recognized as valid the study of an economist who testified on the taxpayer's behalf, and significantly reduced the board's triennial assessment based on this study. The city and the school district intervened in the appeal. The court found that the common level ratio testimony presented by the economist was competent, credible, and properly accepted by the trial court. The court found that it was proper to make an itemization between land and building by an assessor initially. The court specifically approved the procedure of valuing first, the entire property, second, the land and, then, allocating the balance to the building. The court noted that the primary duty of a court was to review the assessment on the whole property. Thereafter, if the parties could not agree on the division between land and buildings, this matter, too, could be considered but only after the assessment of the whole property had been determined. With respect to the financial impact, the court stated that no taxpayer should be asked to pay more than its fair share of taxes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Board refused to accept the owner's appeals from assessments on the ground that the appeal period had expired. The owners then filed a complaint in mandamus requesting an order directing the Board to hear the appeals. The trial court granted the writ of mandamus. The Board heard the appeals, but made no changes in the assessments. After the trial court reassessed the parcels, both the Board and the owners appealed. Following remand, the trial court reaffirmed its earlier orders. The court held that: (1) the trial court erred in granting the writ of mandamus because the assessor did not reassess the property as required by &sect; 13, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 5452.13, of the Act of June 21, 1939, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 5452.1-.20, and the owners did not request a reassessment prior to the first Monday of September of an inter-triennial year, as required by &sect; 13; (2) the Board was not entitled to question the trial court's erroneous order on appeal because the Board did not file an appeal within the statutory time limits; and (3) the trial court was required to reassess the properties because unrebutted, credible expert testimony of value was improperly rejected.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the trial court's order directing the Board to hear the property owners' appeals and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to enter an order directing the Board to correct the assessments of the subject property in accordance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the lower court's decision because the conviction for manslaughter served as an acquittal on the charge of murder in the first degree and it was clear that the inmate's acquiescence in counsel's recommendation not to appeal was based upon an inadequate appreciation of the consequences of such action.</SPAN></P>

The state finance board sustained an assessment for a use tax deficiency against the carrier. The lower court dismissed the appeal. On further appeal, the court affirmed. The carrier asserted that because it performed services that could be equated with those of a genuine public utility, that is, a common carrier, it was encompassed by the Act's public service sales and use tax exclusion. However, an entity was required to be a &quot;public utility&quot; under the Public Utility Code to qualify for the sales and use tax public utility service exclusion. The cases the carrier cited in support dealt only with admitted public utilities. Although common carriers were specifically included within the definition of &quot;public utility,&quot; contract carriers were excluded from the definition of &quot;common carrier.&quot; Because the two classes of public utilities and nonpublic utilities were reasonably differentiated, the exclusion clause did not conflict with the uniformity clause, Pa.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission sought review of the order of the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the order of court of common pleas that was in favor of appellee school district.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After public hearings, the human rights commission ordered the school district to take steps to desegregate six public schools. The school district appealed and claimed that in the absence of a legislative directive, the school board need not consider race in drawing school boundary lines. The school district also claimed that the &sect; 5(i)(1) of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 P.S. &sect; 955(i)(1), required an affirmative act by the school district. The court of common pleas held that unless the school district intentionally fostered or maintained segregation in the public schools, the human rights commission exceeded its jurisdiction in ordering the school district to take affirmative steps to relieve racial imbalance in its schools. The court of common pleas further held the findings relied upon by the human rights commission were arbitrary and capricious. The superior court affirmed. The court granted allocatur and reversed the decisions of the courts below. The court held that since the school district had the power to take corrective measures, its failure to act amounted to the continued withholding from minority children the advantages of an integrated education.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decisions of the lower courts, which was in favor of the school district, and reinstated the provisions of the human relations commission's order that were directed toward racial imbalance in the schools. The court also remanded the case to the human relations commission.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city finance director argued that because the district attorney was a mayoral candidate, he could not continue to occupy the office of the district attorney and he was required to resign under Article X &sect; 10-107(5) of the city's home rule charter. The court disagreed. The court found that the district attorney was not an officer of the city as to subject him to the provisions under the charter and that the removal provisions under the charter offended the state constitution. Although the district attorney was elected by voters of the city and paid from city funds, his duties were performed on behalf of the Commonwealth. Therefore the court held that he was not a city officer. He was also not a county officer because he did not perform his duties on behalf of a county. The court considered the district attorney to be a quasi-judicial officer. Under the state constitution, the district attorney could be removed from office upon a conviction of misbehavior in office. If he were subject to the charter, he would be liable to removal from office by a method offensive to the constitutionally ordained exclusive methods of removal of a constitutional officer.</SPAN></P>

The trial court directed payment of the salary and ruled that the district attorney was a state officer and not prohibited by the city's home rule charter from running for election as mayor while remaining in office as prosecutor. On appeal, the finance director argued that Pa. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 1 explicitly provided that district attorneys were county officers, that Pa. Const. art. XIV, &sect; 8(1) abolished all county offices in Philadelphia and required the city to perform all county government functions, and that under Phila., Pa., Home Rule Charter art. X, &sect; 10-107(5), no city officer or employee, except incumbents running for reelection, was permitted to be a candidate for any public office unless he resigned from his city office or employment. The district attorney argued that as a prosecutor he was a state officer and not subject to the Phila., Pa., Home Rule Charter.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The property owners filed an equity action against the authority due to the proposed construction of public housing.

The authority filed preliminary objections including a motion for a more specific pleading. The trial court sustained that portion of the preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court reversed the decree and remanded to the trial court for the purpose of permitting the property owners to amend their complaint. The court found that, pursuant to the &quot;Right to Know&quot; statute, until the property owners' requested disclosure was made it could not be determined whether the actions of the authority were arbitrary and capricious, and thus amenable to judicial restraint, or beyond judicial restraint.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner filed a petition with the trial court for a rule to show cause why a complaint he proposed to file against the oil companies should not remain within the exclusive jurisdiction of the state trial court. The complaint, not filed but attached to the owner's petition, charged the oil companies with common law conspiracy in restraint of trade. The rule was granted and proceedings stayed, but two days earlier the oil companies removed the action to federal court. At that time the oil companies filed a bond, which was conditioned that the oil companies would pay all costs and disbursements incurred by reason of the removal proceedings should it be determined that the case was improperly removed. The action was remanded to the state trial court and the owner sought costs, fees, and disbursements, based on the bond. The court quashed the appeal because the trial court's order refusing to award the claimed costs and fees was not a final and appealable order. The order did not conclusively establish the rights of the parties. The reason was that the owner never filed his complaint. Once the petition was remanded the owner sought reimbursement without ever filing his action.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and held that the legislation was constitutional. The court concluded that a decrease in actuarial soundness was by itself insufficient to constitute a deprivation of vested rights or an impairment of contractual rights.

The court held that 7 P.S. &sect; 905(a), (c) of the Banking Code of 1965 specifically left to the department's discretion whether to hold a hearing. From those provisions, the court reasoned that the non-requirement for a hearing was based upon the legislature's recognizing the sensitive nature of the confidentiality of banking information.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commonwealth had condemned part of the condemnee's land in order to provide access lanes to an interstate, which in turn required widening the road in front of the condemnee's property. The condemnee filed preliminary objections alleging that the taking was an unconstitutional exercise of the commonwealth's power of eminent domain because the taking was in fact for a private rather than a public purpose. It was undisputed that a rival shopping center would benefit from the project. The trial court concluded that the condemnee had failed to substantiate its charges with even a scintilla of evidence of fraud, corruption or misfeasance. The trial court's conclusions were approved by an en banc panel, and the court likewise affirmed. The condemnee had not met its burden to overcome the presumption that the highway department's officials had performed their duties in good faith. Further, the taking did not lose its public character merely because the rival shopping center stood to gain. The court also quashed the appeal of one of the condemnee's tenants because it was potentially entitled to file its own objections to the condemnation.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that, at the time of the trial, the doctrine of tacit admissions was judicially accepted in the Commonwealth, and the Miranda proscriptions against the evidentiary use of such admissions did not have to be applied where the judgment against defendant had become finalized prior to the Miranda ruling. In addition, defendant was not prejudiced due to the absence of counsel when the implicating statement was presented to him, nor was he deprived of the right to confront the individual making the statement because the credibility of the individual was not an issue under the tacit admission rule. The record did not support defendant's claim that he was coerced into making a confession. The court thus concluded that defendant was not entitled to a writ of habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance was adopted pursuant to Philadelphia, Pa., Home Rule Charter &sect; 2-102, and the realignment of the city's wards changed ward boundaries and designations and the number of wards. The city solicitor advised that redistricting by the city council was required in sufficient time to accommodate upcoming primary elections, and when the claimants submitted an alternative redistricting plan, they conceded that the ordinance, as introduced, was not objectionable as to equality of population. The bill was adopted without the proposed alterations. The court found an abuse of discretion in aborting an electoral process already in motion and found that at least one legislative attempt at revision was always allowed, even where an imminent election was to be held under an invalid plan. The court concluded that the ordinance did not deviate enough from the substantial equality of population tests in the state and federal reapportionment decisions to require inquiries into compactness, preservation of historical or physical boundaries, or gerrymandering and that the alternative plan was not significantly closer in equality of population than the redistricting ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the citizens or other taxpayers did not have a constitutional right to proportionate representation on school boards.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants argued that the statute violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 20, which prohibited the legislature from delegating any power to levy taxes or perform any municipal function. The court found that when first enacted, the Community College Act provided that a school district could sponsor such school and enter into contracts that would be binding upon the local sponsor. This had previously been found to be unconstitutional because it gave a board of trustees unlimited power to incur debts. The legislature then amended the statute by &sect; 2 of the amending Act of October 26, 1965, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 24, &sect; 5203(b). The court held that the legislature had the power to provide for a system of community colleges; only its delegation of authority in one aspect of so doing was at issue. The 1965 amendment was curative legislation designed to erase a supposed defect in the Act. The legislature was competent to enact such curative legislation. Under the amended statute, all fiscal authority was vested in the local sponsor; administration of the operations of the community college was vested in the board of trustees, which posed no constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's arrest, he admitted stabbing the victim. Defendant made a second statement after a preliminary hearing. The court disagreed with defendant's argument that the second statement, obtained when he was without counsel and had not been warned of his right to remain silent, should not have been admitted into evidence. The statement was made under pre-Miranda and pre-Escobedo law, and the statement was not rendered inadmissible where defendant was not shown to be prejudiced by such admission. A waiver of defendant's right to counsel had occurred because he had not requested counsel. Defendant was not denied his constitutional rights by the admission of his statement made after his preliminary hearing and prior to his representation by counsel. A preliminary hearing was not deemed to be a critical stage of the criminal proceeding. Moreover, defendant had failed to object at trial to the admission of the second statement. Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 784 was not violated by the failure to appoint counsel until after his indictment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee quarry, located within the township, was constructed, but not yet operational, prior to the enactment of a zoning ordinance of the township that completed banned quarrying within its borders.

On appeal of the lower court's determination that the ordinance was in derogation of the Enabling Act, 53 P.S. &sect;&sect; 67001-67003, as well as unconstitutional, the court ruled that the Enabling Act, which granted broad and flexible powers, did authorize township-wide bans on selected uses of land, but that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court held that a zoning ordinance which totally excludes a particular business from an entire municipality must bear a more substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare than an ordinance which merely confines that business to a certain area in the municipality. The court then found that the townships objections to the quarry, such as noise, vibrations, aesthetics, were not sufficiently related to the protection of public health and safety as to sustain the constitutionality of the restriction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the parties settled their dispute and after they filed their second petitions for a refund, a common pleas court issued a ruling that under the Realty Transfer Tax Act, 1951 Pa. Laws 1742, the commonwealth did not have authority to impose a transfer tax after a certain date (the very same dispute as was between the parties). Section 503 of the Fiscal Code, 72 P.S. &sect; 503, gave the board jurisdiction to hear a petition for refund originally paid under an act or interpretation of an act later held unconstitutional. The court held that once an agreement or stipulation was entered into, a later decision more favorable to one side than the other did not allow the side so favored to withdraw from the prior agreement or stipulation and relitigate a settled issue. The taxpayers had not paid the taxes under the circumstances cited in the Fiscal Code. The taxes were paid as the result of a settlement.

Moreover, the school buses were operated for the benefit of the children who rode the buses and not for the benefit of the church, which might have been associated with the school in which the children received a state-supervised education.

Ann. tit. 52, &sect; 6758. A justice of the peace had found the owner guilty of violating the ordinance, but on appeal and after a hearing, the lower court found him not guilty.</SPAN></P>

On further review, the court found that the Township had failed to comply with Pa. R. Civ. P. 68 =, which provided that where the subject matter of a suit did not fall within the statutory jurisdiction of a lower court, where a statute expressly provided that there would be no appeal from an order of a lower court or provided that an order would be final or conclusive or not subject to review, or where the relevant statute was silent on the question of appellate review, an appeal to the court in the nature of a certiorari from a judgment order or decree would lie only if specially allowed by the court. The court held that Rule 68 = set forth the requirements of a petition filed by a party seeking an appeal to the court, and that no such petition was filed by the Township. The court quashed the appeal.</SPAN></P>

The owners argued that the Act violated the uniformity clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution because it subjected ground rents to a special tax in addition to general real property tax, that the Act violated the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution because it taxed the owners' real estate at more than 100 percent of its actual value, while other real estate was taxed at less than 100 percent, that the Act was unconstitutionally vague, and that the self-tax assessing system established by the district denied the owners a right of appeal. The trial court agreed and restrained the school district from levying, assessing, and collecting tax under the Act. The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that the district had not complied with &sect; 657 of Pa. Public School Code of 1949, Pa. Stat.

The detective also listened on an extension phone to the employee's conversation with defendant. Defendant agreed to come to the employee's home to pick up the prints and to pay the employee for obtaining them. Defendant picked up the prints and was arrested. On appeal, defendant argued that the interception of his telephone conversation without his permission was illegal. The court found that the Act of July 16, 1957, 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 2443, required the consent of both parties to the communication. While the employee consented, defendant did not. The commonwealth asserted that it was not illegal to listen in on a telephone extension without consent. The court disagreed because a wiretap and a telephone extension both resulted in eavesdropping, which was an unconstitutional invasion of privacy.</SPAN></P>

The township filed preliminary objections challenging equity jurisdiction pursuant to the Eminent Domain Code, Act of June 22, 1964, P. L. 84, &sect; 101 et seq., Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 26, &sect; 1-101 et seq. (Supp. 1965).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The club contended that equity had jurisdiction to enjoin the planned condemnation of its real estate because the remedy afforded by the Eminent Domain Code was inadequate under the circumstances. Allegedly when the club lost possession it would be put out of business because its business could not be relocated. The court disagreed, stating that the legislature did not contemplate a resort to equity courts by either condemnor or condemnee. The court pointed out that in the instant matter, no declaration of taking had been filed when the club began its suit in equity, although several weeks later the township's board of supervisors enacted an ordinance authorizing the filing of such a declaration. The court concluded that the Eminent Domain Code established procedures which protected and safeguarded the rights of the condemnee to the same extent as would a proceeding in equity. The court held that because the legislature provided exclusive proceedings under the Code in eminent domain cases, no remedy in equity was available to an injured property owner such as the club.</SPAN></P>

Upon review the court affirmed the trial court's order. The court held that because the inmate failed, at the trial level, to attack the voluntariness of his confession, he could not attack it years later in connection with an habeas corpus petition. The court found that because the inmate signed a guilty plea that informed him that he was waiving his right to a jury trial, his contention that he was not informed of his right to a jury trial was without merit.

On appeal, the court found that appellants, as representatives of the taxpayers of the City of Philadelphia, possessed the requisite pecuniary interest in the projects to challenge the transaction. The court found that appellee was not free to dispense with competitive bidding in the leasing of air rights and held that the agreement entered into by private negotiation rather than by competitive bidding was unauthorized and void.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff litigant was severely injured when a keg of beer, which his father had purchased and his brother had tapped, exploded. The litigant brought an action for damages against defendants, the beer distributor, the brewer who filled the keg, and the manufacturer of the keg. The Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County (Pennsylvania) sustained defendants' demurrers and dismissed the complaint. The litigant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The litigant relied on a theory of exclusive control, averring in his complaint that he had no knowledge of the cause of the explosion or of which party defendant was responsible for the explosion. The trial court held that the doctrine was inapplicable because the litigant had failed to join his father and brother as defendants. The court said, however, that it did not need to determine whether or not the trial court erred with regard to the law of exclusive control because the court adopted a new basis for liability in Pennsylvania, which was strict liability in tort for defective products. The court held that one who sold any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property was subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if (a) the seller was engaged in the business of selling such a product, and (b) the product was expected to and did reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the condition in which it was sold. The court stated that the rule applied even where the seller had exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellate court vacated the order that dismissed the litigant's complaint, permitting the litigant to amend his complaint to explicitly state a cause of action in trespass for defective products liability.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant telephone company sought review of a decree entered by the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which held that its original decree, which enjoined appellee City of Philadelphia from enforcing a tax known as the Mercantile License Tax as to the telephone company, was in error and which modified the decree as to restrain the enforcement only for certain years preceding and including 1953.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the Sterling Act the City adopted an ordinance imposing the Mercantile License Tax upon persons engaged in certain business activities. The telephone company and others successfully sought a decree in equity prohibiting as to them imposition of the Tax. The decree perpetually enjoined the City from enforcing or attempting to enforce the Tax against the company. The City later assessed the Tax against certain of the telephone company's incidental receipts. When it was held that the City's assessment violated the decree, the City petitioned for a modification of the injunction. The lower court granted the petition and held that the decree, which enjoined collection of the Tax perpetually, was in error. The lower court also held that the question as to whether the company's incidental receipts were subject to the Tax was a proper one for consideration by the Philadelphia Tax Review Board. The court found that an erroneous interpretation of a taxing statute did not result in the statute not being enforced again against the decree winner. The court also rejected the company's objections to equity's referral of the matter to the Tax Review Board. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's decree.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county enacted an ordinance which prohibited persons or corporations from constructing pipelines without submitting to it plans related to the routes and use of such lines. The electric company refused to be bound by the provisions of that ordinance and began construction of a pipeline project. By response the county instituted an action in equity to enjoin the company from pursuing that construction job. The county's ordinance was declared unconstitutional by the trial court and the court affirmed its decision. Counties were subdivisions of the State and enjoyed no sovereign power to legislate on statewide matters. Counties could not legislate independently of a Commonwealth's declared policy. Under the Public Utility Law, Act of May 28, 1937, 1937 P. L. 1053, &sect; 1 et seq., as amended ( Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 66, &sect; 1101 et seq.) the Public Utility Commission had regulatory jurisdiction over companies. Courts would not originally adjudicate matters within the Commission's jurisdiction, including matters related to the service of power. If the county objected to the company's actions its remedy was to ask the Commission for appropriate regulatory relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The borough passed an ordinance that regulated the mining of anthracite coal by the strip mine method within its territorial limits. The strip miner argued that the ordinance was invalid because the commonwealth had preempted the regulation of strip mining. The court affirmed the decree and held the ordinance invalid and enjoined the borough from its enforcement. The court first determined that the lower court had equity jurisdiction because the strip miner's only remedy at law would have subjected it to criminal prosecution, and thus it was not an adequate remedy at law to divest the lower court of equity jurisdiction. The commonwealth's Anthracite Strip Mining Law, 52 P.S. &sect; 681.1 et seq., which provided for the improvement and conservation of lands affected by the strip mining of anthracite coal, vested exclusive jurisdiction over coal stripping operations in a state agency. The use of the words &quot;exclusive jurisdiction&quot; showed the legislature's intent that only the commonwealth was to regulate the anthracite strip mining industry. Thus, legislative action in the same field by any political subdivision, such as the borough, was precluded.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated the order and remanded. The court held that the lower court erred in dismissing the owner's objection to the authority's power and right to condemn the property because he asserted that it was not blighted. Section 406(a)(1) of the Eminent Domain Code provided that preliminary objections were the exclusive method of challenging the power or right of the condemnor to appropriate the condemned property unless the same had been previously adjudicated. The authority declared that the area was blighted, thereby making the thrust of the owner's attack directly to the authority's power, not to its wisdom.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate alleged a number of trial errors, which the trial court below refused to entertain. The inmate contended that his trial counsel declined to undertake an appeal and that while imprisoned he was without funds or knowledge to perfect an appeal absent such assistance. Thus, the inmate contended, although entitled to appellate review as of right, the refusal of his appointed counsel to undertake the appeal effectively prevented him from exercising that right. The court held that where a state provided appellate review of criminal convictions as of right, it might not afford such review to indigents on terms less favorable than those afforded non-indigents. Furthermore, absence of a waiver, a state might not refuse to provide an indigent defendant with assistance of counsel on appeal as of right. The court held that the right to the assistance of counsel on appeal necessarily included the right to such assistance in the critical task of taking and perfecting an appeal. Therefore, the inmate might not be foreclosed from exercising his right to appellate review if his failure to assert the right was the result of an unconstitutional deprivation of the assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

The Commission determined that the homeowner did discriminate against the complainant and thereafter, the city brought a suit in equity against the homeowner. On appeal, the city argued that the failure of homeowner to appeal from the order of the Commission prevented him from attacking collaterally that order in an enforcement proceeding. Moreover, the city contended that the Fair Practices Ordinance (Ordinance) did not provide for a trial de novo in an enforcement proceeding. The court held that the homeowner did not have a right of direct appeal and therefore, he could not have waived, by failing to exercise a nonexistent right, the opportunity to attack the order of the Commission.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It was beyond question that, after having served the minimum term of his original sentence, the inmate, while on release as a parolee, was convicted of the crime of aggravated robbery and that, after having been released from confinement on the sentence imposed on the charge of aggravated robbery, he was returned to the custody of the Pennsylvania Parole Board and recommitted as a violator of his parole. In the exercise of its discretion, the Board recommitted the inmate and such recommitment extended the date of his maximum term on the original sentence. The court held that such action did not offend any constitutional right belonging to the inmate, because where a prisoner on parole was convicted of another crime, the Board had the authority to recommit the prisoner to serve the balance of the term which he would have been compelled to serve had he not been paroled and to forfeit any credit for the time he was at liberty on parole. The court further held that the inmate was not entitled to a trial on his parole violation, because Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 61, &sect; 331.21(a) (1951) only required a hearing before the Board, which the inmate was granted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged, on constitutional and statutory grounds, the imposition of a gross premiums tax on domestic life insurance companies and foreign insurance companies pursuant to 72 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect;&sect; 2270.1 - 2270.10. The trial court sustained the tax, and appellant again challenged, contending that: the tax denied due process and equal protection of the laws based on inequities in taxation of foreign insurers and domestic non-life insurance companies; only life insurance premiums, not those collected from accident and health contracts, were subject to the tax; and premiums collected on policies issued prior to the 1961 enactment were exempt from the tax. The court found that the legislature could reasonably classify taxpayers and impose taxes based on those classifications. Appellant did not meet its burden of establishing that the classification made clearly, palpably and plainly violated the state and federal constitutions. As such, the tax was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A township passed a zoning ordinance which required a minimum area of four acres per building lot in certain residential districts in the township. An applicant for a building permit challenged the ordinance as unconstitutional after its request was denied. During a hearing the board of adjustment granted the township's motion to quash the appeal. The lower court reversed that ruling, and the township then appealed. Procedurally, the court determined that lower court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the applicant had filed its appeal within a reasonable time in part because some of the delay was not due to any action or inaction on the part of the applicant. As to the merits of the action, the court held that the four acre minimum requirement in the context of the case was unconstitutional because the particular zoning action was designed to be exclusive and exclusionary and thus did not foster or promote the general welfare. Therefore, the adjustment board committed an error of law in upholding the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance.</SPAN></P>

The court found that certain transactions of 1928 and 1938 represented apportionable events, the mathematical determination of which had to be decided upon remand. The court also found that the executrix was not estopped from receiving the dividends after the widow's death and that no hardship resulted to the trustee if the provisions of the trust were enforced. The court determined that the widow had a vested property right in 1918, when the decedent died, to all property that legally belonged to her under the existing rules of law. The court determined further that those rights to the &quot;income&quot;, as represented by the distributions, became vested in each respective year, and the retroactive application of a future statute did not constitutionally extinguish them.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county passed a zoning ordinance to regulate the use of land for the excavation of sand, gravel, coal or other minerals, and peat moss for sale. The strip mine owners sought to enjoin the county from enforcing the ordinance, alleging that the ordinance was invalid. They also alleged irreparable harm and the absence of an adequate remedy at law. The court of common pleas granted a preliminary injunction, denied a petition by the county to dissolve the injunction, and continued the injunction. The court vacated and remanded the judgment with directions to dismiss the strip mine owners' complaint as premature. The strip mine owners had not sought, nor had they been denied, the right to engage in any activities on their land, and there had been no indication or threat of enforcement. The court noted that the injunction improperly restrained enforcement of the provisions regulating use of land for quarries, sand and gravel pits, and peat moss bogs, which were in no way involved in the proceedings. Finally, the court noted that the statutory procedures for challenging zoning ordinances provided an adequate remedy at law and were not so cumbersome as to result in irreparable harm.</SPAN></P>

Petitioners opposed the redistricting of schools and the concentration of authority in each individual school district. The lower court refused to enjoin the statute and the court granted certiorari to examine the legislation. It held that the school district, created by the state legislature, was in the best position to determine what its own district needed in terms of goals and objectives. Thus, providing a method for delivering public education was within the constitutional duty of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county approved the authority's plan to redevelop an area that was deemed blighted by the Urban Renewal Board (board).

The landowner brought an action against the authority to enjoin the authority from taking her property. The chancellor concluded that the area of the landowner's property was not blighted and entered a decree which forbade the taking of her property. The authority appealed. The court reversed, holding that the courts could not substitute their discretion for that of the board on the question of blight unless the board's actions were arbitrary, made in bad faith, or not in conformance with the procedures ordained by statute. The court found that the landowner had not demonstrated circumstances, which would have permitted the courts to interfere with the board's discretion. The court held that it could not construe the board's actions as arbitrary merely because one small part of the entire blighted area was free from blight. Comprehensive planning required that areas be considered in their entirety and not in their unseverable parts.</SPAN></P>

The lower court held in favor of the hospital, and the patient alleged on appeal that the lower court's grant of judgment on the pleadings was improper because the doctrine of charitable immunity should not have applied to the hospital. The patient contended that because the hospital received payments for its services, it therefore could not truly be called a charity hospital.

Upon review, the court found the word &quot;shall&quot; in &sect; 13.2 was an imperative, and the port authority was required to submit the dispute to mandatory binding arbitration upon the failure of the negotiations. The court observed that &sect; 13.2 was not contrary to Pa. Const. art.

The court found the arbitration provision of the Act did not constitute an illegal delegation of legislative power under Pa. Const. art.

Defendant was convicted at trial and sought review. The court held that defendant had the right to, and great need for, the statements he requested. The court opined that it would be unfair to allow a state prosecutor to block access to FBI statements by asserting that the defendant could get the information elsewhere. The court held that denying defendant the FBI reports constituted a denial of due process and ordered a new trial.</SPAN></P>

Nevertheless, the court vacated the trial court ruling and remanded the matter. The court found that the proper procedure for a property tax assessment dispute was not followed by the trial court. On remand, the trial court was to first decide on the basis of the evidence what the fair market value of the property involved was. Of course, if the assessment was in excess of that value, it must be reduced. Secondly, the trial court was to determine the appropriate ratio of assessed value to market value which existed in Allegheny County.

The proceedings were governed by the provisions of the Act of July 20, 1953, P. L. 550, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect;&sect; 67501- 67508 (Act).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court referred the matter to a board of commissioners. Appellants questioned the constitutionality of the Act. They also asserted that the trial court erred in placing the burden of proof on appellants, in ruling that the motives of the proponents of annexation were irrelevant, and in making findings of fact unsupported by evidence. Third, they contended the trial court's reliance on the belief that a majority of persons in the area to be annexed favored the annexation was improper. On appeal, the court held that the power given to the trial court to inquire into the propriety of an annexation under the Act did not involve an unlawful allocation of legislative power to the judiciary. After a complaint was filed asking for the appointment of a fact-finding body, the trial court should have made determinations as to its legality and propriety. It was error to place the burden of proof upon appellants. The board went beyond usual procedures, for it stated in its report that it made inquiry by conferring with interested counsel and by considering certain unsolicited communications and verbal advice, which were improper methods of finding facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The metal company was a Pennsylvania corporation with its sole place of business in Philadelphia.

The state settled the tax by determining net income to be $ 676,140.18 (the amount of taxable income reported to the federal government). The state then computed the tax without resort to the allocation fractions set forth in the Corporate Net Income Tax Act, it simply applied the six percent tax rate to all of the company's net income. The state then resettled the company's tax, which the board and lower court upheld. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment upholding the resettlement, finding that the company transacted all of its business in state; thus under the Act it was not entitled to apportion any part of its net income outside of the state. The court held that the state could impose a tax or excise on the privilege of doing business within the state and require such a tax to be measured by the net income of the corporation derived from all of its activities as long as that income was fairly apportioned to the taxing state by reference to in-state factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relator, who, without counsel, was sentenced to imprisonment, appealed to the Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which certified the case under the appropriate statute, the Act of June 24, 1895, P.L. 212, &sect; 10, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 17, &sect; 197.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the objective of a guideline opinion for the assistance of trial courts might be generally commendable, that mission in this complex and developing area was not achieved. The court's recent decisions indicated that much of what was said in the guideline opinion filed in the Superior Court did not express the permissible constitutional doctrines to be applied to habeas corpus proceedings. The proper disposition of the matter before the court did not require as broad a discussion as that attempted below. In its view, the order of the court of common pleas should not be affirmed. Relator was denied his constitutional right to counsel unless he understandingly and intelligently waived that privilege. Such waiver was, of course, possible. Here, however, the transcript of the hearing at which the pleas were taken and the sentences imposed was absolutely devoid of any reference to counsel. Additionally, the record was utterly without suggestion or a single element of waiver. Because there was no allegation of waiver and because the record did not, in any way, sustain a finding of waiver, the court held that relator was unconstitutionally denied the assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the order of the court of common pleas should not be affirmed. The disposition was without prejudice to relator's right to withdraw his petition in the court of common pleas should he have desired to do so.</SPAN></P>

The trial court approved the distribution to uniform principal of cash from the sale of rights and the shares of stock received as stock dividends. The allocation was made under the Uniform Principal and Income Act of July 3, 1947 (act), 1947 Pa. Laws 1283, which a recent decision held constitutionally applicable to trusts created prior to the effective date of the act. On appeal, the life tenants argued that the act, as applied to the trust created years prior to the effective date of the act, deprived the life tenants of their property without due process of law. The court affirmed the order confirming the trustees' accounting. In doing so, the court failed to find any constitutional deficiency in the act. The court specifically held that (1) the life tenants had no vested right in a definition of income, (2) the legislature had the power to define income, and (3) the legislature had not acted arbitrarily.</SPAN></P>

The commission and the railways company filed a motion to quash the appeal on the grounds that the order was interlocutory and not appealable. The trial court reversed the order of the commission and refused the motion to quash. On appeal, the court determined that the issue of whether the commission had power to make the order was moot and granted the motion to quash. The court held that because &sect; 13.1 of the Second Class County Port Authority Act, 55. P.S. &sect; 563.1, which granted the Port of Allegheny County Authority the power to develop an integrated mass transit system for the area, expressly stated that the commission had no authority to regulate in any respect within the service area, the commission was ousted of its jurisdiction and there was no longer a justiciable case or controversy between the parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, taxpayers and electors, filed complaints in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, against defendant, the Secretary of the Commonwealth, alleging that voter redistricting laws violated the Fourteenth Amendment. After lawmakers redrafted the statutes, the taxpayers asked the court to take immediate jurisdiction and determine the constitutionality of 25 P.S. &sect;&sect; 2221, 2217 (Supp. 1963).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers amended the complaint to include an attack on Pa. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 16, 17 and proposed reapportionment bills pending in the legislature. The court held that seats in both houses of a bicameral state legislature had been apportioned on a population basis. Further, the court found that an individual's right to vote for state legislators was unconstitutionally impaired when that right was substantially diluted when compared with votes of citizens living in other parts of the state. The court held that Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 16 required that senatorial reapportionment legislation had to maintain the integrity of counties and other political subdivisions whenever possible. The court held, however, that lawmakers had to provide for compact districts of contiguous territory subject to the overriding mandate that all districts shall be &quot;as nearly equal in population&quot; as possible. The court held that Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 17 required lawmakers to do the same for state representatives' districts. The court held that the Pennsylvania constitutional provisions were in accord with the Fourteenth Amendment and that the statutes, as drafted, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that both statutes were unconstitutional and found that the legislature was required to enact reapportionment laws that conformed to constitutional requirements.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant railway company sought review of two orders from the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania), which refused to grant it a preliminary injunction to enjoin appellee port authority from filing its petition to condemn railway property, appointed viewers to assess the condemnation damages, and granted the port authority permission to pay into court a percentage of damages resulting from its exercise of eminent domain.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the railway company argued that the eminent domain power granted to the port authority by the Second Class Port Authority Act of 1956 (Act), 55 P.S. &sect; 551 et seq., violated the state and federal constitutions; the statutory delegation of sole authority to the condemnor to estimate damages and the determination by the condemnor of what constituted a transportation system as stated in the Act was unconstitutional; and corporate records not related to the operation or maintenance of its system were wrongfully condemned by the port authority. Upon review, the court modified and affirmed the judgment relating to the assessment of damages and payment, and affirmed the judgment denying the railway company's petition for preliminary injunction. Because the trial court did not entertain an application for surety by the port authority in its condemnation of the railway company's property and did not pass on the adequacy of the bond, the court ordered the port authority to give its bond to the railway company, and made it unlimited in amount and secured it by all of the assets of the port authority.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment denying the railway company's petition for preliminary injunction and dismissed that cause of action, modified and affirmed the judgment relating to the assessment of damages and payment into court, and held that the port authority was to give a bond to the railway company that was unlimited in amount and secured by all port authority assets.</SPAN></P>

The court found that no one knew or could determine, except by guessing, whether the votes, or indeed any votes in the blank spaces, represented protest votes, non-partisan votes, Republican votes, Democratic votes, votes for the political committee's candidate, or &quot;mistake&quot; votes; but the court found that the votes were illegally cast and were clearly and undoubtedly void votes. The court also found that the only exceptions to cases where votes were inappropriately cast were where there were minor irregularities, especially if committed by election officials, and in cases where a voter voted correctly in the right row and in the right square and in the right space, but then added something which was surplusage.

Defendant argued that the Act was an improper delegation of legislative power in contravention of Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 1. Defendant also contended that the Act violated the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV because it did not treat those acquitted of felonies or of summary offenses in a similar manner. The court upheld the statute and the imposition of costs. The court found that just as costs in civil cases could be imposed whenever permitted by statute, not as a penalty but rather as compensation to a litigant for expenses, so, too, the costs under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 19, &sect; 1222 (1860) represented compensation or partial reimbursement to the county for expenses incurred in a prosecution.</SPAN></P>

The court held that 43 P.S. &sect; 206d did not preclude the issuance of the injunction because the labor dispute at issue was excluded from the Labor Anti-Injunction Act. The court also held that 1939 Pa. Laws 302 was not an unconstitutional repeal of the entire Labor Anti-Injunction Act contrary to Pa. Const. art. III, &sect;3.

They topography, location, and characteristics of the property undoubtedly justified the reclassification and rezoning. It was not spot zoning because, among other things, a large part of the surrounding land had the same or virtually the same classification as the tract in question and the uses permitted by the down zoning were substantially similar to those permitted on numerous adjoining properties.</SPAN></P>

The accident occurred on land that was ceded to the federal government in 1937 by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The pedestrian filed suit. The driver and her husband, who lived in Florida, were served under the substituted service provisions of the Nonresident Motorist Act. They filed objections, contending that such service violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8 because the federal government had jurisdiction over federal lands. The trial court dismissed the objections and the court affirmed. The Pennsylvania Nonresident Motorist Act was clearly a law of Pennsylvania which by its own terms governed the rights of the parties in an action brought to recover on account of injuries sustained in a federal enclave located within the exterior boundaries of Pennsylvania. The words &quot;within the Commonwealth&quot; in the Act were intended to encompass all territory within the geographical borders of Pennsylvania, including any federal enclave located therein.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the Milk Control Commission (Pennsylvania), sought review of a decision by the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which sustained preliminary objections of appellees, a farm through its owners. The trial court found for appellees. The Commission sought to enjoin, in equity, appellees from selling milk that was removed from the farm before sale to consumers at less than the minimum prices set by the Commission.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees asserted in their preliminary objections that they were exempt from the licensing and pricing provisions of the Milk Control Law, April 28, 1937, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 31, &sect;&sect; 700j-101 to 700j-1302 (Supp. 1963). The court found, however, that all that the Pennsylvania Legislature intended to exempt in &sect; 402 of the Milk Control Law, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 31, &sect; 700j-402 (Supp. 1963), was the family-farm type of producer-dealer operation. The court determined that it would have been in contradiction of the legislative purpose and objective to permit an exempt farm operation to receive its product from a commercial handler or to have its milk processed by such a dealer. The court also found that it could not say that the limitation on the exemption violated the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or the Constitution of the United States of America. The court also determined that it could not hold that the classification bore no reasonable relation to the price structure that the Commission was statutorily empowered to fix and maintain. Therefore, the statute had to stand.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that the ordinances were void and the court affirmed. It found that the cities had the legal power to levy a true occupational privilege tax, if the power was properly exercised; however the particular ordinances involved presented certain difficulties. Pa. Const. art. IX, &sect;&sect; 1-2 required that all taxes were to be uniform, upon the same class of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax. Further, while different subjects could be reasonably classified for tax purposes, there must be no lack of uniformity within the class, either on the given subject of the tax or the persons affected as payers. Finally, if a tax was levied on an occupational privilege, it must apply to all who share the privilege. The ordinances in question, however, lacked uniformity as they levied a tax which exempted certain individuals because their incomes did not exceed stated amounts and were therefore void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The developer presented a detailed plan to develop a tract of land in the township and asked that it be rezoned. A rezoning ordinance was passed after public hearings. A second rezoning request was denied after the association objected. A building permit was issued for an apartment building without objection. When a permit for a store was issued, the association filed an appeal to the board, which upheld the permit. The association brought an action in the trial court, which held the rezoning ordinances invalid. On appeal, the court reversed, finding that the association had participated in the planning process for four years and had expressed its satisfaction with the plan, except on one occasion when their objection succeeded. The court ruled that the association was aware that the project was an interdependent complex premised on implementation of the complete plan and its conduct led the developer to believe that the development would proceed as planned. The court concluded that, although a building permit could be challenged within 30 days of its issuance, the association was challenging the entire plan and, thus, it should have appealed the issuance of the first permit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a city and the operator of its gas works, sought an injunction restraining defendant, the state secretary of revenue, from collecting the gross receipts tax imposed under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 2181. The Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County (Pennsylvania) entered a decree dismissing plaintiffs' complaint, and they appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under &sect; 23 of the Act of June 1, 1889, P.L. 420 (Pennsylvania), a gross receipts tax was imposed on specified companies, including electric light and power companies. As amended by the Act of May 13, 1925, P.L. 702, the gross receipts of a municipally owned and operated public utility were exempted from the tax. The Act of May 16, 1935, P.L. 200, imposed the tax on the gross receipts of municipal utilities from business done outside the municipality's boundaries, and the Act of November 21, 1959, P.L. 1553, added gas utilities to the list of taxable companies and provided that the tax applied to municipalities, except that receipts other than gas receipts were exempt. The city claimed that the 1959 act was unconstitutional because it arbitrarily subjected municipal gas utilities, but not municipal electric utilities, to the gross receipts tax. In remanding the case for further proceedings, the court found that the parties' stipulation regarding the factors distinguishing gas from electric companies was so lacking in factual data that it was inadequate for the purpose of deciding the constitutional question.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c2">DISSENTING OPINION BY MR. JUSTICE COHEN: </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I agree with Justice JONES and Judge TAXIS of the court below that the settlor did not &quot;direct&quot; the apportionment between principal and income so as to bring this trust within the proviso clause of section 2 of the Principal and Income Act.  </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I likewise agree that our decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Catherwood</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> with respect to the retroactive application of the Act to ordinary stock dividends is entitled to as much weight as our decision with regard to extraordinary stock dividends - a determination which the majority apparently accepts.

<P CLASS="c13"><SPAN CLASS="c2">I would go further, however, and hold that the retroactive application of the Act to ordinary stock dividends does not violate due process or constitute an impairment of the obligation of contracts, as contended by appellant.  As we held in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Catherwood,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> &quot;[there] is no vested property right in a court-made rule of apportionment.&quot; [405 Pa. at 77]. Instead of undermining the Act of 1947 and our decision in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Catherwood,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as the majority does, I would give appellant the opportunity to question the constitutionality of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c14">Catherwood</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> before the United States Supreme Court - the obvious purpose of this litigation.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant life tenant sought review of the order of the Orphans' Court of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which awarded a six percent stock dividend to the trust's principal. The life tenant contended that the dividend was trust income under res adjudicata, the law of the case, due process of law, and because an award to principal would impair the obligation of the deed of trust in violation of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the settlor created the subject trust, the law provided that extraordinary stock dividends up to and including six percent were trust income. The Principal and Income Act of 1945 provided that stock dividends were apportionable. Applying the new law to the six percent stock dividend, the Orphans' Court determined that the six percent stock dividend was deemed principal. The court held that as to wills of persons dying before and inter vivos trusts created prior to the effective date of the Principal and Income Act of 1945, a gift of income or net income included small stock dividends of six percent or less unless the testator or settlor clearly expressed a contrary intent. In light of the facts and circumstances which surrounded the settlor at the time she created the trust and considering the law that existed when she created the trust, the court concluded that she gave and intended to give the life tenant of this trust the small stock dividends of six percent or less, as well as the cash dividends which were paid annually.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the Orphans' Court and remanded with directions to enter a decree in conformity with the court's opinion that the six percent stock dividend was trust income payable to the life tenant.</SPAN></P>

At the time of purchase, the land was improved with a two-story block building, formerly used as a chicken house and hog pen. The property owners placed on their land a mobile-home or trailer and used it as a dwelling house. On appeal, the court sought to determine whether the zoning ordinance operated in such an arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory or confiscatory manner so as to unconstitutionally deprive the property owners of the use of their property. The burden was on the property owners to show that the maintenance of their mobile home, improved as proposed, would not have been inimical to the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the inhabitants of the township. The court found that the refusal to grant the property owners permission to improve their mobile home was arbitrary and discriminatory. The court concluded that &sect; 704.1 of the Township Zoning Ordinance of 1960 placed an unreasonable, arbitrary and discriminatory restriction on the property owners' use of their property.</SPAN></P>

The court next found that equitable jurisdiction always extended to suits brought challenging the very power of the legislature to enact a statute, including a tax statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contract between the transportation company and the union representing its employees had expired, and their attempts to negotiate the terms of a new contract had been unsuccessful. The union declared a strike that resulted in a complete cessation of all public transportation in the city causing great hardship to the public. The court determined that the record did not support the appointment of a temporary receiver for the transportation company's solvent business. The court concluded that the trial court appointed the receiver to end the strike. However, in the absence of any justification in the law or in applicable principles of equity for the appointment of a receiver, temporary or otherwise, the trial court abused its discretion. The appointment of a receiver could not be used as a weapon of coercion to force the transportation company to settle a strike, and the court determined that a receiver could not be appointed where receivership was the sole relief asked.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the trial court finding that there was no justification for the appointment of a receiver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The neighboring property owners protested the variance on the grounds that a single-family dwelling could be built and that an apartment would greatly change the character of the neighborhood by increasing congestion, population density, and school taxes, and would be contrary to the public safety and general welfare. The court held that the party seeking a variance was required to show unnecessary hardship and that a variance was not contrary to the public safety, health, morals, or general welfare. The court also held that a variance would not be granted solely on the grounds of economic hardship, particularly where the property was purchased with knowledge of the economic hardship. The court also held that a zoning law and a variance could constitute an unconstitutional taking if it diminished the value of property. Because the evidence was slight, the court reversed without prejudice for the construction company to reapply for a variance and to establish that the erection of buildings that did not require a variance was so impractical as to completely prohibit or substantially destroy the lawful use of the property.</SPAN></P>

Defendant posted bond and perfected an appeal to the lower court, which held a trial de novo. At the trial, the corporate owner of the tractor-trailer filed a petition to intervene and for a declaratory judgment that &sect; 903 was unconstitutional. Although the lower court took no action on the petition, the contentions raised as to the constitutionality of &sect; 903 were discussed and dismissed. Defendant was found guilty. On appeal, the court held that defendant had no standing to resist the enforcement of the impounding provision under &sect; 903, noting that the tractor trailer belonged to another. The court also held that the validity of defendant's fine was not dependent upon the constitutionality of the impounding provision, as the provision for the fine was able to be severed from the impounding provision.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the judicial actions on the part of the judge went beyond the scope of his jurisdiction. The actions of the judge were found to have lacked legality as the judge was not assigned to the grand jury room when he commandeered the grand jury, and thus abused his discretion. The office of a special prosecutor did not exist, thus such an appointment was unlawful. The investigation ordered was found to have constituted an unwarranted interference with the orderly functioning of the legislative branch, and the court held that an elected official was entitled to due process prior to removal unless misconduct was clear.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed, finding that the testator's clear intent was to limit the trustee to exceptionally safe investments. The term &quot;similar public divisions&quot; meant political subdivisions and did not include Pennsylvania turnpike bonds. The Fiduciaries Investment Act of 1949, 20 P.S. &sect; 821 et seq., as amended in 1951, allowing the fiduciary to invest in stocks where not expressly prohibited by the trust instrument, could not be applied to defeat the testator's clear intent. The restrictive investment clause in the testator's will was an express restriction within the meaning of the act.

On appeal, the court affirmed the order of the trial court and held that the ordinance was not vague or indefinite but clearly expressed the intent of the city council.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission approved the authority's construction of portions of a bridge and allocated as costs the company's expenses in moving its electric lines to accommodate the construction. The authority appealed the allocation of costs, which was thereafter affirmed in a final order. In a separate proceeding, relocation costs for a different area of the bridge were allocated to the authority. However, this allocation was reversed because 66 P.S. &sect; 1181 did not authorize the same. The authority then brought an action to enjoin the commission from certifying the costs that were upheld in the former proceeding. The trial court denied the authority's motion for judgment on the pleadings and, on appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's decree. The court held that the opinion in the latter case did not establish the law of the case and render the former adjudication null and void. The former proceeding was entirely separate and distinct from the litigation that gave rise to the present appeal. The doctrine of res judicata also precluded the authority's equity action. The former decision, though it was in error, was allowed to become final and it was binding on all the parties thereto.</SPAN></P>

The property owner had previously constructed a three-unit apartment building on an adjoining lot. The property owner sought review from a decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which affirmed the zoning board's order refusing to grant the building permit.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The zoning board initially denied the building permit based on the proposed apartment building's failure to meet the side yard requirements of the borough zoning ordinance. Subsequently, the zoning ordinance was amended to permit only the erection of single-family detached dwellings in the area, and the zoning board rejected another application for the building permit on that basis. On appeal, the court held that the council did not act improperly in passing the prohibitory ordinance. The court found that the property owner acquired no vested right in the continuation of the previous zoning classification, and the second apartment house was not a natural extension of the nonconforming use to which the land was devoted. The court also held that the zoning legislation did not violate the requirement of The Borough Code, 53 P.S. &sect; 48303, that zoning legislation be enacted in accordance with a comprehensive plan. The court found that the ordinance constituted an integral part of a general land program for the county wherein the continued existence of the affected area as one being predominately of single or double homes was contemplated.</SPAN></P>

The testamentary trustee had been directed to distribute the corpus of the estate to the testator's heirs at law. The issue was the correctness of the determination of the lower court that the invalid limitations were so much a part of testator's testamentary scheme of distribution that the intermediate life estates became infected and had to fall. The court held that the life estate as well as the ultimate gifts of corpus were so essential to the testator's scheme, that, being invalid, he would not have wanted the prior valid gifts of income to continue. The lower court had agreed with the auditor that the testator's plan in the relevant paragraph was to delay vesting of his estate until vesting in the great-grandchildren of the named beneficiaries or grandchildren who might be born after lives in being and 21 years thereafter. The court held that the testamentary scheme, the general plan of distribution, and dominant intent of the testator was to tie up his trust estate for a period beyond that permitted by the rule.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant retailer sought review of an order of the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania), which sustained the exceptions of appellees, mayor of city, managing director of city, district attorney of city, and police commissioner of city, to the retailer's adjudication attacking the validity of P.L. 660, &sect; 1 (1959), 18 P.S. &sect; 4699.10 (act), dissolved the injunction against appellees, and declared the act to be valid.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retailer attacked the validity of the act, which prohibited the retail sale of certain specified commodities on Sundays, on the grounds that the act violated Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 7 in that it was a local or special law regulating labor or trade, and that the act violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV because enforcement was conducted in a discriminatory manner by appellees. Appellees filed exceptions to the retailer's adjudication, which were sustained, and the trial court declared the act to be valid and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the act did not violate Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 7 or the Fourteenth Amendment because the legislative classification bore a reasonable and logical relationship to the end sought, that of an effective enforcement of a valid legislative act in an area particularly subject to violation. The court found that injunctive relief against the district attorney and the police commissioner was not justified because the action against those appellees on the issue of enforcement of the act necessarily abated upon their leaving public office.</SPAN></P>

From the issuance of a permit to the owner, the civic association appealed to the Board questioning on substantive grounds the validity of the ordinance allowing the permit. The Board was of the opinion that it lacked authority to order additional testimony and denied the civic association's appeal. The civic association then appealed to the court of common pleas which directed that the record be remanded to the Board for taking additional testimony. After hearing, the Board again denied the civic association's appeal and, on appeal from that ruling, the court of common pleas, without taking any additional testimony or hearing the matter de novo, upheld the Board's action. The civic association appealed. The court quashed the appeal because the only question the civic association appealed was that of the vague and indefiniteness of the ordinance. Since that issue had not been properly raised in the court of common pleas, it could not be heard on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of violating a local speed ordinance. Defendant responded with a rule to show cause as to why his conviction should not have been vacated. The court of quarter sessions concluded that the rule was improper, but in the interest of justice considered it as an appeal. The court of quarter sessions concluded that the issues raised in defendant's appeal were without merit, and affirmed his conviction. Defendant then filed an application for a writ of certiorari with the court of common pleas, which the Commonwealth sought to quash. The court of common pleas granted the motion, and defendant appealed both lower courts' orders. The court concluded as an initial matter that defendant's legal and constitutional contentions were devoid of merit. Furthermore, because there was adequate evidence to support his guilt, the sentence was affirmed. As to the order quashing his writ, the court noted that a defendant who had been convicted in a summary proceeding before a magistrate had to have made his election to proceed either by appeal or certiorari. Because defendant had already appealed, he was unable to seek review pursuant to certiorari. That order was also proper.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the city's power to establish and enforce a charter derived from the legislature, which, in turn, derived the ability to delegate such power from the state constitution. The court found that in granting home rule to Philadelphia, the legislature required its elections to comply with the Pennsylvania Election Code, Pa. Stat.

Thirteen years earlier the employee had retired from another county and was receiving retirement benefits from that county during the period that she had worked for the most recent county. On appeal, three issues were raised: (1) whether the estate of a deceased county employee who was employed on the effective date of the retirement system but died before contributing to the retirement fund and before making application for retirement was entitled to the benefits of the retirement fund so long as her personal representative tendered the contribution based upon the compensation earned between the effective date of the system and the date of death; (2) whether folio and transcript fees paid to a court stenographer was to be included in computing the retirement benefits of such court stenographer; (3) whether a county employee was barred from receiving retirement benefits from two different and separate political subdivisions?

The underlying facts involved the creation of an inter vivos trust, wherein the settlor's two children were to collect the income for life and, at their deaths, the res was to be distributed to the children's descendants per stirpes. The court analyzed the various rules of apportionment and concluded that the court below had erred with respect to the second problem presented in the case at bar--whether small stock dividends belonged to the life tenants or whether they should be apportioned. The court opined that it had never held that ordinary small stock dividends should be considered as income payable to the life tenant; it had also never held to the contrary. The court ruled that if a total stock distribution for the current year was payable at the rate of 6 percent or less of the corporation's outstanding shares before such distributions were made, such distribution in stock of the distributing corporation should be treated as income.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (Pennsylvania) entered an order disbarring the attorney, based on the report and recommendation of a bar committee that the attorney was guilty of unprofessional conduct. The attorney appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The attorney was a member of the Communist Party from 1946 to 1950. The court held that the attorney was deprived of his constitutional right to practice his profession without due process of law by the order of disbarment entered by the trial court. The bar committee acted, directly and through its subcommittee, which consisted of three of its own members, as prosecutor, judge, and jury at the hearing on the committee's own complaint against the attorney. The subcommittee's proceedings were legally incapable of supporting the trial court's order of disbarment, which was entered solely on the basis of the committee's report and recommendation. The court also held that the evidence before the subcommittee was insufficient, as a matter of law, to convict the attorney of professional misconduct because findings that the attorney was a member and functionary of the Communist Party did not justify an inference that he (1) lacked good moral character, (2) was not attached to the tenets of the United States Constitution, (3) advocated the forcible and violent overthrow of the government, or (4) engaged in or was associated with any unlawful activity.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was indicted for murder and was tried under the Split-Verdict Act.

As required by the Split-Verdict Act, the trial court then entered upon a hearing with respect to the penalty to be imposed on the verdict, at which hearing the jury received additional evidence on the question of the penalty to be imposed on the convict, as between death and life imprisonment. The jury fixed the penalty at death. On review, defendant contended that the trial court erroneously permitted a victim of a prior armed robbery to testify at the penalty hearing. Affirming, the court held that it required a stretch of the imagination beyond all reason to say that the testimony of the victim of the prior unassociated robbery played any essential part in the fixing of the penalty by the jury, which had just heard all of the Commonwealth's evidence against defendant at the trial on the question of his guilt or innocence of the murder and which had found him guilty of that murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court stated that an employee cannot be considered ineligible for benefits simply because the plant has shutdown for a vacation period as agreed to by him or his union. The court held that his eligibility may still be questioned if he is, in fact, individually unavailable for work; but this is, as stated, a determination aimed at his personal status, not one acquired by an agreement with the employer. The court found nothing in the record or in the briefs or arguments to indicate that claimants were unavailable for work, finding in fact, the determination of eligibility could only lead to the contrary conclusion that they were available.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed in part but reversed in part the trial court's orders. The court held that the trial court had correctly asserted jurisdiction over the action pursuant to 17 P.S. &sect; 251. The court also held that the trial court had correctly asserted jurisdiction over the gas company because it was the necessary party to the action. The court further held that although the commonwealth held title to the property, the action sought to dispossess the gas company of the property Finally, the court held that the trial court had jurisdiction over the commonwealth despite its contentions of sovereign immunity because once the commonwealth had intervened in the action pursuant to 12 P.S. &sect; 145, it waived its immunity to suit.</SPAN></P>

Appellees filed preliminary objections to the complaint in the nature of a demurrer and a chancellor entered a decree dismissing the complaint. The trial court confirmed the chancellor's adjudication. On appeal, the court held that the act did not constitute a local or special law regulating the affairs of counties or granting special or exclusive privileges in violation of Pa. Const. art. III, &sect; 7. The Act required a petition to be signed by at least 5,000 registered electors before the subject of harness racing could be submitted to the voters. The court stated that nothing in the Act prevented counties from becoming members of the class having more than 5,000 registered electors and determined, therefore, that such a classification was not lacking in uniformity. The court found that a classification based on a certain number of registered electors was reasonable and founded on a genuine distinction. The court concluded that the Act did not grant any special and exclusive privileges to the licensees thereunder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff property owner brought an action to recover damages from defendant municipality because of a substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of land caused by flights of aircraft at low altitudes. A board of viewers assessed damages and the trial court dismissed the exceptions of both parties to the board's decision. Both parties appealed. The court found that the navigable air space that Congress placed in the public domain did not include the path of glide for an airplane's take-off or landing. However, there was no evidence that defendant exercised any control over aircraft. Thus, plaintiff was precluded from recovering against defendant. The relief that plaintiff sought appeared to be contemplated by Section 403 of the Aeronautical Code of May 25, 1933, 2 P.S. &sect; 1469, which placed liability on the owners or operators of the aircraft. Because the owners or operators were not clothed with the power of eminent domain, plaintiff could not proceed against them through a viewer's proceeding. The order dismissing defendant's exceptions to the viewers' report was reversed with directions that the viewers' report be vacated and set aside. Plaintiff's appeal was dismissed.</SPAN></P>

There was no taking of plaintiff property owner's land by defendant because it did not control the aircraft.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a charitable organization. It sought to enjoin the city from collecting real estate taxes on the portions of the taxpayer's building used for dormitories, a coffee shop, and rented by other charitable organizations. The taxpayer argue that its building was entirely exempt from taxation. Section 204(i) of the General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. &sect; 5020-204 exempted from taxation real property owned by a charity and used or occupied jointly by it and another charity. The court noted that a statutory procedure existed for challenging tax assessments. Equity only had jurisdiction over such challenges where there was a total want of power to tax or where the mode of assessment violated a constitutional right. Absent a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute or of official action thereunder, equity had no jurisdiction to restrain the collection of taxes. But the court nonetheless addressed the issues. The court held that &sect; 204(i) did not apply to cases where the owner charity realized a rental income from the leasing of the property.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed, first finding that the order was appealable because even though the order was termed an &quot;interim order,&quot; the chancellor's edict in practical effect denied the owner's requested relief. The court then found that the objective of the picketing, to persuade people not to patronize the taproom so that its owner would move to another location, did not violate a legitimate, clearly defined law or public policy of the state; thus it was protected free speech under U.S. Const. amend I.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant legislative committee members (members) appealed a decree of the Court of Common Pleas No. 6 of Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, which dismissed the members' preliminary objections and granted plaintiff taxpayer a preliminary injunction, in the taxpayer's action seeking to restrain the members from taking any action authorized by a certain Senate resolution, and to enjoin any expenditures of funds of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought the instant action against the members to prohibit the Pennsylvania State Senate from adopting a resolution at a regular session in an even-numbered year creating a committee of its members for the purpose of making certain specified investigations unrelated to either revenue or appropriations. The lower court ordered the members to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue, overruled their preliminary objections, and enjoined them preliminarily from performing the duties imposed upon them by the resolution. On the members' appeal, the court reversed, holding that the members' objection that the venue of the controversy was exclusively in Dauphin County pursuant to Pa. R. Civ. P. 1503(c) was well taken. Moreover, contrary to the lower court's findings, the Senate resolution involved was not a &quot;law&quot; within the purview of Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 4, and the adoption of the resolution at the 1960 regular session was not thereby prohibited. However, the Senate was without constitutional power to investigate the conduct of a particular district attorney as provided by the resolution involved. The court vacated the decree and dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated the lower court's decree and dismissed the taxpayer's complaint seeking to prohibit action on a particular state Senate resolution.</SPAN></P>

The zoning board and landowner argued that the ordinances were part of a comprehensive development plan. The court reversed the order. The court determined that the ordinances were at variance with legislative directives because they were not enacted in accordance with a comprehensive plan and devolved upon township supervisors duties beyond those outlined in the enabling legislation. The court concluded that the ordinances were invalid and that the permits were improperly issued. The court pointed out that the adoption of a procedure whereby it was decided which areas would eventually be zoned limited industrial on a case by case basis patently admitted that at the point of enactment of the ordinances there was no orderly plan of particular land use for the community and that the development itself would become the plan, which was the antithesis of zoning in accordance with a comprehensive plan under 53 Pa.

The lower court adjudged that the ordinance was constitutional and the trailer owners appealed. The court held that the township was without standing to invoke the jurisdiction of the lower court for the purpose of having the constitutionality of its ordinance adjudicated in a declaratory judgment proceeding. The court found that if a question concerning the constitutionality of an ordinance was to have been passed upon, it could have been done properly only as a sequence of an actual controversy based upon a sufficient allegation by a complainant of being harmed or threatened with imminent harm in violation of constitutionally protected rights and that the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act did not extend such a right to a political subdivision with legislative power.</SPAN></P>

The city's powers and responsibilities were not unlawfully delegated to a private party because the contract provided that the hospital board would continue to operate the hospital. Defendants were presumed to have acted lawfully and in good faith because the taxpayer failed to allege any facts to support his claim of waste and because the courts would not review defendants' determination of need in the absence of bad faith. The court also rejected the taxpayer's argument that the private universities' policies were discriminatory, thus making the contract contrary to public policy.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A plan was recorded in the office of the Recorder of Deeds, which contained a dedication of all streets plotted thereon to public use forever. One of these streets was the driveway in question, which was a dead end street that served various lots and which had been vacated by the borough. The landowner later became the successor in title of some of the lots. All of his property, except that fronting the driveway, was surrounded by residential homes. He later applied for a permit, or alternatively a variance, to build a residence on two of the lots he acquired. He proposed to erect, in the residential zone in question, a home that would have an area of 41,400 square feet, with a 122-foot frontage on the driveway. A permit official refused to grant the landowner the requested permit, and the Board sustained this refusal. The lower court reversed the Board's decision and issued such permit. The court affirmed the order, by holding that the landowner's requested permit did not violate Allegheny County, Pa., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 502 because it met the minimum 60 foot frontage requirement, despite the fact that the driveway was not a public street since it had been vacated by the borough.</SPAN></P>

The court then held that, while excerpts from the trial court's jury instructions were misleading, the instructions as a whole did not require reversal of the judgment. The court also held that caselaw subsequent to defendant's conviction that removed an accused's burden of proving alibi was not retroactive and thus did not apply to the case at issue. Additionally, the court held that the passage of the state's split-verdict statute, which worked to abolish a rule allowing the introduction of evidence of prior crimes in the guilt phase of capital criminal cases, did not apply retroactively to defendant's case. In denying a subsequent motion to reargue, the court held that defendant incorrectly deduced the court's vote on the issues involved in the case.</SPAN></P>

From 1933 through 1954 the Company's total earnings with respect to the shares held by this trust were $1,720,326.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court determined that the life tenant was not entitled to apportion the value of certain shares of stock that comprised the trust fund because the &quot;stock split&quot; of those shares did not comprise a division of earnings, profits, or accumulations of the shares that constituted the trust fund. The life tenant argued that the &quot;stock split&quot; was in reality a stock dividend, and as such, was a proper subject for apportionment. The court rejected the life tenant's argument. The court noted that there was a hybrid situation but regardless of how it was described, the &quot;stock split&quot; involved in the case did not constitute either a division of corporate earnings or profits and was, therefore, not a recognized apportionable event. Thus, the increase in the shares of stock that resulted from the stock split did not entitle the life tenant to apportionment because no division of corporate earnings or profits had taken place.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed the order, which dissolved the preliminary injunction against defendants. The question before the court was whether the trial court had reasonable grounds for its action. The court held that an act could not be declared unconstitutional unless it violated the constitution clearly, palpably, plainly, and in such manner as to leave no doubt or hesitation in the court. The court held that the constitutionality of the amendatory Act of 1959 was not so doubtful as to render unreasonable the trial court's conclusion that the presumption of the statute's constitutional validity had not been sufficiently impugned to warrant the continuance of the preliminary injunction.</SPAN></P>

The claimant then sought a writ of mandamus to compel the prothonotary to accept the transcript and alleged that the Act was unconstitutional. The trial court held that the Act was constitutional. On appeal, the court found that the claimant could not raise the question of the Act's constitutionality because he failed to show that he was or would be denied a right of trial by jury on his appeal from the judgment by the justice of the peace. The claimant had no standing to question the constitutionality of the Act unless he showed that his constitutional right was or would be violated by the Act's enforcement.

I, &sect; 8 and that the imposition of the tax on the companies was invalid as being imposed on the companies' privilege of engaging in interstate commerce. Upon appeal, the court reversed the decision. The court found that the Act was intended to include and tax only foreign corporations which were engaged solely in interstate commerce in the commonwealth and which employed property or carried on local activities in the commonwealth in connection with interstate commerce. The court held that the levies under the Act were not privilege taxes based on the right to carry on business in commonwealth. The commonwealth was to collect only through ordinary means. The tax, therefore, was not open to the objection that it compelled the companies to pay for the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In order to determine the net income of the foreign corporation, which transacted part of its business inside the commonwealth, the commonwealth used three fractions under the Act: 1) tangible property; 2) wages and salaries; and 3) gross receipts. When the commonwealth included dividends, interest, proceeds from security sales, and proceeds from asset conversions in the gross receipts fraction, the foreign corporation brought an action challenging the inclusions and the Act's constitutionality. Following an unfavorable judgment, the foreign corporation sought review, and the court affirmed. After finding the security sales had been properly included in the fraction, the court held the proceeds from the asset conversions had been includable under the ordinary definition of gross receipts, the term having not been statutorily defined. Furthermore, the court held the exemption of dividends and interest from taxation had not excluded those items from the foreign corporation's gross receipts. Finally, the court held the Act's imprecise measurement of income was not constitutionally fatal and that its misapplication had not violated the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court affirmed, finding that the trial court was correct in holding that it was without jurisdiction to impose an injunction. The court held that, because the word &quot;employer&quot; in the Labor Anti-Injunction Act, 43 Pa. Cons. Stat. &sect; 206c, specifically included corporations not for profit, the club was an employer within the meaning of the Act. The court held that it was clear that the request for an injunction was a labor dispute that was included within the Act, and thus to grant the injunction would violate the public policy declared by the Act. Moreover, the court noted that the trial court also was justified in refusing to impose the heavy hand of injunction under the circumstances of the case as a court of equity, where it found that the picketing was constitutionally protected because it did not have an unlawful object, was not forbidden by law, and did not contravene public policy.

He continued to experience pain and, in 1957, discovered that a surgical sponge had been left in his abdomen after the surgery.

The trial court granted appellee's motion for judgment on the pleadings based on the running of Pennsylvania's two-year statute of limitations under &sect; 34, and appellant sought review. The court reversed. The court found that appellee's negligence was not in the use of the sponge, but in his failure to remove it. The court held that the statute could not have started to run when appellee failed to remove the sponge because, at that time, appellant had suffered no damages. Thus, the court held that the statute of limitations on appellant's injury began running when appellant discovered that the sponge had been left in his abdomen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner was the proprietor of a barbershop in which he had no employees. Several union men appeared outside his barbershop with signs attempting to force the owner to join the union.

The owner successfully petitioned to restrain and enjoin the union, with its officers and members, from picketing his shop, from interfering with his business, and from intimidating or attempting to intimidate him to join the union. The court noted that the owner was not qualified for membership in this union because he was not an employee. The court held that the picketing of a one-man establishment by a union was an invasion of an American's freedom to determine his own economic destiny when he stood alone in an enterprise of his own. The court opined, however, that labor unions had the right to picket for organizational purposes, such as to persuade non-union employees of an establishment to join a union.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The film distributor had an exclusive agreement to release a film in America. The district attorney, after a private viewing, determined it to be in violation of &sect; 528 of the Penal Code, Pa. Stat. tit. 18, &sect; 4528, and that he would arrest any one involved in showing the film. The local theaters informed the distributor that they would breach their contract to show the film. The distributor filed an action in equity against the district attorney, seeking an injunction against the district attorney. After hearing, the court denied the injunction and held that equity was without jurisdiction to hear the action. The district attorney then arrested the managers of the theaters and seized the film. The managers were charged with the criminal indictment but the trials were continued pending the outcome of this action. On appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that on these facts, equity had jurisdiction to decide the action because the distributor had no adequate remedy at law to enforce its property rights which would be adversely affected by a questionable criminal proceeding to which he was not a party.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged the trial court's dismissal of their action for the enjoinment of the Secretary's ability to certify candidates or to hold an election. The taxpayers claimed that the Apportionment Act of May 10, 1921, P.L. 449 was unconstitutional and that the General Assembly should have divided the state into senatorial districts. The Secretary claimed that the action should have been dismissed for failure to join the General Assembly as a necessary party. The court affirmed the dismissal of the case, as the court was without the power to grant the relief that the taxpayers sought. The court held that the General Assembly's failure to divide the state into senatorial districts raised a purely political question. Whether the aforementioned act required such division into districts that were as nearly equal as was possible was within the discretion of the General Assembly. Additionally, an election of senators at large, as suggested by the taxpayers was not legal. Pa. Const. art II, &sect; 16 provided that each district was only entitled to elect one senator. The election could not be at large because by law they had to be elected by districts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant moved for reargument on the grounds that the court in its previous opinion dismissing appellant's bill did not expressly pass upon his contention that the Pennsylvania Senatorial Apportionment Act of May 10, 1921, P.L. 449, was unconstitutional for its failure to conform to Pa. Const. art. II, &sect; 16, which required two senators for a county with a one and three-fifths population ratio. The court denied appellant's petition for reargument. The court held that the Act was a valid statutory enactment that conformed to the Pennsylvania Constitution when enacted and that a mere change in the population of a county that required reapportioning of a senate district under the Pennsylvania Constitution did not render the Act invalid. The Act would be rendered invalid only if the legislature reapportioned the district pursuant to the Act in violation of the applicable constitutional provisions. The court concluded that the courts were without authority to compel the legislature to reapportion the legislative districts of the state and that the legislature's failure to reapportion state legislative districts was a political and not a justiciable question.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commonwealth approved plans for the reconstruction and improvement of a road that was near the lands held by the farmers. Appearing on the Commonwealth's plans, but otherwise unnoted, were pencilled lines suggesting that, at a future time, the Commonwealth may have desired to further widen the road. Thirty-two years after improving the road, the Commonwealth implemented its plan to widen it. The farmers sued the Commonwealth, seeking damages for the encroachment of their land. The farmers were awarded damages, to which the Commonwealth excepted. The exceptions were dismissed and the Commonwealth appealed. The court affirmed, holding that when the Commonwealth's department of highways filed its original plans, it made no effort to advise the farmers, directly or indirectly, that some day it would cut a swath 50 feet wide through the farm, and that there was no prior indication, either by word or symbol, that the Commonwealth had intended to condemn a 50-foot belt of land.

The taxpayer claimed that the tax violated the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. On appeal, the court held that the trial court did not err when dismissed the appeal because the Commerce Clause was not violated. A State could, consistent with the Commerce Clause, impose upon vehicles engaged in interstate commerce a reasonable, nondiscriminatory excise tax as compensation for the use of its highways. The taxpayer did not show that the tax plus the toll exceeded fair compensation for its use of the Turnpike, or that there was a lack of uniformity in the operation of the tax. The court rejected the taxpayer's contention that Turnpike mileage could not be used in the taxing formula. The Act and its supplements indicated that the Turnpike was intended by the Legislature to be part of the State highway system.</SPAN></P>

The decisions had been affirmed by two lower appellate courts and went to the next appellate level on allocatur. The court affirmed the suspensions, holding that &sect; 4-493 and Pa.

The regulation was directed against a well-defined group, and its purpose was the abolition of certain well-recognized and prevalent evils historically associated with the consumption of alcohol on licensed premises.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a township and intervening landowners, challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County (Pennsylvania), which reversed a zoning board decision and awarded to appellee oil company a permit to build a &quot;tank farm&quot; on farmland that it owned and was zoned &quot;A Residential.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company attempted to have the zoning of its land changed from residential to industrial so that it could build a tank farm on which large tanks for storing gasoline and petroleum products would have been installed. The township refused to change the zoning or to issue a permit to allow the tank farm. The trial court reversed the zoning board's decision on the ground that refusal to allow the tank farm was unconstitutional, arbitrary, and unreasonable because the land was about the geographical center of a supposed industrialized area. Reversing, the court held that the record did not bear out the conclusion about the geographical center. Further, the court found that the trial court's jurisdiction was limited to determining whether there was substantial evidence to support the board's findings, whether there was any mistake of law, and whether there was any abuse of discretion. However, the court found that the trial court failed to limit itself to such scope of review. The court found that the township had the right to take whatever measures the situation demanded to prevent foreseeable harm and to limit an encroaching imperilment in its residential district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Services were supplied by the city, the property owner's tenant failed to pay water charges, and a lien was filed against the premises. An amended writ of sci. fa. was served on the property owner, who filed an affidavit of defense and counterclaim. The trial court entered judgment for the city and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected the contention that the purpose of Philadelphia, Pa., Code of General Ordinances tit. 19, &sect; 1606(3) was to impose on the city a requirement of due notice before it could can either shut off the water or assert a statutory lien. The failure of the city to shut off the water did not affect the enforcement of the lien under the Act of May 16, 1923, 1923 Pa. Laws 207. The court rejected the property owner's contention that the city could not enforce a statutory lien for excess water and sewer rent because the city negotiated and agreed with the tenant alone for the payment of delinquent water and sewer rent, and hence, was estopped from enforcing the lien.</SPAN></P>

On further appeal, the court reversed the trial court and reinstated the department's decision.

The Barber Act, 1935 Pa. Laws 158, &sect; 2, had provided that nothing contained in this act could be construed as prohibiting any municipality from adopting appropriate ordinances that were not inconsistent with this act.

On appeal, the court reversed because the time provisions in &sect; 6-677.1 were directory and not mandatory, which meant that the property owner had a right of appeal from a reassessment. The court also held that &sect; 6-677.1 was not a new tax levy; that it was not discriminatory because it was applied uniformly; and that it was not vague, indefinite, or ambiguous.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the school district was an agency of the legislature and had only the powers granted to it by statute. The court held that the school district had no statutory authority to enter into an agreement to fund a juvenile delinquency program. The court held that the agreement was illegal pursuant to art. VI, &sect; 610 of the Pennsylvania Public School Code (Act), 1949 Pa. Laws 30, 24 P.S. &sect; 610, which provided that the use or payment of public school funds by a school district for any purpose not provided in the Act was illegal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, which affirmed a trial court's judgment convicting him of bookmaking and pool selling, a violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 18, &sect; 4607, and refusing his motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment. Among the issues raised was the admissibility of telephone conversations intercepted in violation of &sect; 605 of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C.S. &sect; 605.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of bookmaking and pool selling. The superior court affirmed the trial court's judgment. Defendant argued that the &quot;best evidence&quot; rule required that the contents of a tape recording be proven by the playing of the recording itself, that there was no evidence of venue, and that the conviction could not stand because it was based solely upon unauthorized interception and divulgence of telephone conversations in violation of &sect; 605. The court stated that the superior court correctly held that the best evidence of the intercepted conversations was the testimony of a detective who had actually heard the conversations as they occurred. There was sufficient evidence of record to establish that defendant was in the county in which venue was laid at the time he committed the offense. Even though wiretapping by state officials violated &sect; 605, a state rule of evidence allowing admission of such evidence in state courts would not be overturned. The wiretapping evidence was admissible at the time of defendant's conviction and was sufficient in nature and quality to support the conviction because it established that defendant had illegally accepted some 11 bets.</SPAN></P>

The Commission affirmed its prior order, which asserted jurisdiction over the matter and enjoined the railroad from charging the United States discounted rates. On appeal, the trial court affirmed the Commission's order. On further appeal, the court reversed the decision of the trial court. The court found that application of the Act to federal government would have imposed an unreasonable burden. The court relied upon common law, which held the exemption of the United States' procurement services from the discretionary authority of a state agency was not violative of the mandate of state statutory law. The court ruled that common law holding that state regulation imposed no prohibition on the federal government was distinguishable. The court further decided that regulations authorized by 10 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 2301-2314 sanctioned the policy of negotiating rates for shipment of federal property.</SPAN></P>

Thereafter, the neighbors appealed the board's decision to the trial court, which concluded that the applicants were not entitled to the certificate. On appeal, the court upheld the trial court's judgment in favor of the neighbors. Specifically, the court held that the record clearly indicated that the board abused its discretion when it awarded the certificate to the applicants since the commercial enterprise did not remotely qualify under the provisions of the zoning ordinance. In addition, the court emphasized that it was clear from the record that the operation of the commercial enterprise, considering its size and scope, would have had a very definite bearing on the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community. Lastly, the court concluded that the limitations in the zoning ordinance, directed at businesses &quot;for neighborhood use&quot; only, constituted a proper constitutional exercise of police power.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The optician asserted that that the enforcement of the Act of 1956, 63 P.S. &sect; 237, which prohibited advertising the price of products used for ophthalmic purposes, impaired his right of freedom of speech and constituted an unauthorized exercise of police power. He obtained a temporary injunction in the trial court against the enforcement of the Act. The trial court later dissolved the injunction and dismissed the complaint. The optician appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that as the state's regulation of the practice of optometry was already found to be a valid exercise of its police power, the state could regulate the sale of glasses. As the fitting of the glasses into suitable frames was part of the operation of preparing glasses to make them usable, the state could regulate the sale of frames. As advertising could have a direct bearing on the quality of lenses and frames, the state could regulate that too. The court found that the amendment of 1956 was germane to the original Act of 1917, and promoted but a single objective, the protection of the eyesight of the public.

On appeal, the court held that the burden of proving clearly and unmistakably the unconstitutionality of a legislative enactment was upon the person so asserting.

The taxpayer argued that an amendment to the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax Act, excluding proceeds from securities sales from the definition of gross receipts, applied retroactively to the resettlement.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the Department of Revenue learned that the taxpayer had not included the proceeds from securities sales in its gross receipts, the Department resettled the taxpayer's 1953 corporate net income taxes. Before the resettlement was approved, the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax Act was amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 3420b, to exclude such proceeds from the definition of gross receipts. The taxpayer argued that the use of the term &quot;heretofore&quot; should be construed to mean that proceeds from securities transactions could not be included in gross receipts regardless of the taxable year in which they occurred. On appeal, the court explained that the legislature had broad taxing powers, including the power to tax retroactively, but that it had to clearly express an intent to do so in light of the rule favoring prospective statutory construction. Nothing in the Act suggested an intent for retroactive application. The proposed construction was contrary to the Pennsylvania Statutory Construction Act, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 46, &sect;&sect; 573, 574, and 581. It would also impose different tax burdens on corporations with offices located inside and outside the Commonwealth.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that when the property owner purchased the house she knew or should have known of the provisions of the zoning ordinance restricting the property to use as a one-family dwelling and of the large expenditures required to maintain and keep up the property. Thus, the property owner took the property with the conditions of economic hardship staring her in the face, and she could not be heard to complain. The city's undertaking to control the density of its population in accordance with a comprehensive plan drawn to promote the welfare of the community was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. The court was unable to say that requiring the property owner to use her property in conformance with the provisions of the zoning ordinance would not preserve the attractive characteristics of the community and the property values therein. Therefore, the attack upon the reasonableness of the application of the ordinance to the property failed.</SPAN></P>

The inmate had been found delinquent when he was approximately 17 years of age as the result of a burglary then committed by him. The inmate contended in his writ of petition for habeas corpus that the use of his juvenile court record in the consideration of the sentence was in violation of Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 11, &sect; 261. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court. The court found that the inmate's juvenile court record was not introduced or presented as evidence in the 1946 trial. It further found that the inmate's juvenile court record was not considered, even after the trial, to determine a factual issue, that is, his guilt or innocence of the crime with which he had been charged. The court determined that the juvenile record was taken into consideration by the trial judge in 1946 after the inmate had pleaded guilty and then only for the purpose of imposing a fair, proper, and just sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court that had upheld the denial of the inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, holding that a trial court on sentencing could consider the inmate's juvenile court record.</SPAN></P>

A qualifying examination was prepared for the employees appointed to their posts prior to the effective date of the charter. In effect, the taxpayer was seeking to have the court reconsider that portion of its prior opinion which dealt with the office of clerk of quarter sessions. The taxpayer contended that subjecting the employees of the clerk's office to municipal civil service would threaten the principals of separation of powers. However, the court held that only a person who was affected could raise the constitutional question. That the taxpayer paid tax monies to the city treasury did not establish her standing to maintain the suit, unless she could also demonstrate that her pecuniary interest in the proper use of such funds would be jeopardized, and no such interest was alleged.</SPAN></P>

Additionally, the inmate confirmed the correctness of the contents of his confession in a sworn application to the Board of Pardons. His confession was not rendered constitutionally objectionable by reason of being made in custody unless the detention induced the confession. The court also determined that the inmate failed to establish that he was denied a fair trial because the public was beset by hysteria or passion because he failed to show that the jury was influenced and because there was no evidence that the trial was conducted under other than peaceable and orderly circumstances.

The court affirmed the judgment. There was no constitutional rule of immunity from taxation of intangibles by more than one state. The fact that the intangible property at issue acquired a commercial or business situs in Florida did not bar the state's power to impose a capital stock tax. Since the taxpayer was incorporated in the state, the state gave the taxpayer its existence and defined its powers. Thus, the state's laws governed the taxpayer and under that law, the situs of intangible property for taxation was the taxpayer's domicile.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city sought review of a decision of the Orphans' Court (Pennsylvania), which, on remand from the supreme court, vacated its prior judgment denying admission of two minor orphan Negro applicants to a school established by a benefactor's will, and, instead, appointed new, private trustees who could legally administer the trust pursuant to the benefactor's wishes. The city contended that it was denied procedural due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A testamentary benefactor had established a trust for the financing of a school for &quot;white orphan boys.&quot; The trust had been administered by the city for over 100 years at the time two orphan Negro boys made application for admission to the school. The decision not to admit the boys as violative of the trustor's intent was reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States as violative of the Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection, because the decision had been made by a government entity. On remand to the orphans' court, the court ordered the removal of the city trustees and substituted a board of private individuals for administration of the trust. On appeal, the court affirmed, finding that the orphans' court had found a satisfactory solution because there was nothing in the testator's will or in any legislation by the commonwealth or the city that served to make the school a public charity or that required it to be publicly administered. Thus, the board of private trustees could refuse admittance to the boys without violating the Fourteenth Amendment because there was no government action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the orphans' court appointing new trustees to administer the testator's trust.</SPAN></P>

The trial court affirmed an auditor's conclusion that all of the legatees would bear deduction for state inheritance taxes, but only the residuary legatees would bear the federal estate tax burden. On appeal by the pre-residuary and the residuary legatees, the court modified the decree of the trial court. The court found that the testator's intent, as expressed in his will, overcame the presumption that state inheritance taxes would be borne by each of the legatees. The court found that his specific bequests exhibited his desire that the pre-residuary legatees not bear any deduction for state inheritance taxes . Likewise, the court found that the testator intended that the specific bequests to the pre-residuary legatees be without any deduction for federal estate taxes, as provided in the Estate Tax Apportionment Act of 1951, 1951 Pa.

The board of adjustment granted the permit. The county court sustained the board's decision. On appeal, the court affirmed. While the appeal was pending, the zoning ordinance was amended to require the consent of 80 per cent of the owners. The court held that the amendment did not upgrade the use to which the land could be put, but merely changed the procedure necessary to obtain a building permit. Thus, it did not affect the pending application. The distance within which property owners' consents were required was to be measured from the main structure, rather than the perimeter of the area of the installation.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, taxpayers, sought review from orders entered in the Court of Common Pleas No. 7 for Philadelphia County (Pennsylvania) that sustained decisions of the Tax Review Board that sustained decisions of appellee revenue commissioner that refused the taxpayers' claims for refunds for taxes imposed on them by the Sterling Act, Act of August 5, 1932, P.L. 45, &sect; 1, Pa.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court upheld a local ordinance enacted pursuant to the Sterling Act and denied the taxpayers' claims for refunds for taxes paid to record certain documents that transferred real estate. On appeal, the taxpayers argued that the tax imposed by the Sterling Act was invalid because it constituted a duplication of existing state taxes imposed pursuant to the Act of April 6, 1830, P.L. 272, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 3171. The court rejected this argument and noted that the tax imposed in this case was not imposed on a transaction but was imposed on the presentation of a document for recording. Thus, it was not a duplication of an existing state tax. The court also noted that the State Realty Transfer Act of December 27, 1951, P.L. 1742, as amended, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect;&sect; 3283-3292 did not prohibit the tax imposed in this situation, as this act contained an exception for local ordinances that imposed taxes like the one in this case. The court found that the State Realty Transfer Act did not violate Pa. Const., art. III, &sect; 6, as the constitution did not require every act recite all other acts that its operation might incidentally affect by repeal, modification or extension.</SPAN></P>

The city filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, which the trial court denied. On appeal, the court reversed and dismissed the bill. The court held that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the advertising company's action was one challenging the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner challenged an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which dissolved a preliminary injunction in favor of defendants, a civic association, its officers, and a local property owner. The landowner filed an action in equity to enjoin defendants from appealing the grant of a purported building permit and from bringing any action to impede the granting of certain other building permits.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In addition to enjoining defendants from challenging the building permit, the landowner sought to enjoin defendants from bringing, or &quot;persuading any other person&quot; to bring, any action to impede the granting of building permits on any of the land that had been the subject of a certain prior suit. The prior suit had been brought in a court of quarter sessions and affirmed on appeal. A township adopted an amendment to a zoning ordinance and rezoned some of the landowner's property from residential to commercial. Defendants unsuccessfully challenged the legality of the amendment. The landowner sold some of the rezoned area for the construction of a large building, and the buyer applied for a building permit. The building inspector of the township gave verbal authorization to proceed with the necessary grading, and defendants lodged an appeal under &sect; 3107 of the Act of June 24, 1931, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 53, &sect; 19092-3107. Equity would not take jurisdiction in an attack upon the application of a zoning ordinance because the procedure provided by statute was exclusive. The landowner sought to have a court of equity enjoin defendants from pursuing a remedy provided for by &sect; 19092-3107.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The department of revenue accepted the taxpayer's capital stock report and settled the capital stock tax based on the report. However, the department later found the stock's value to be higher and resettled the tax for a higher amount. The taxpayer contended that that &sect; 1105 of the Fiscal Code, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 72, &sect; 1105 (1929) improperly delegated legislative power. The taxpayer also contended that granting that the department had the right to make a resettlement, it could not have increased the tax except for clerical or mathematical errors, unless it has in its possession accounts and information which it did not have at the time of the original settlement. The court held that &sect; 1105 did not delegate legislative power, it assigned administrative duties. The court stated that the valuation of the property to be taxed was left, of necessity, to the administrative officers. The court also stated that as the fixing of the original assessment could not be regarded as the performance of a legislative function, so also the re-assessment could not be so designated. The court also held that the commonwealth reserved for two years the unlimited right to resettle the tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants challenged the decision of a Superior Court (Pennsylvania), which affirmed defendants' convictions for violations of the Anthracite Mine Law. Defendants were charged and tried under Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 52, &sect; 511, for having been negligently guilty of an offense against the provisions of this act, whereby a dangerous accident had resulted or might have resulted to any person or persons employed in such mine.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prosecution arose out of an occurrence in defendants' mine, in which five miners lost their lives. Defendants contended that the procedure that was followed, which included the filing of an affidavit and the issuance of a warrant, violated Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. This provision stated that no person, for any indictable offense, could have been proceeded against criminally by information. Defendants alleged that the absence of a bill of indictment by the grand jury rendered the statutory procedure invalid. The court rejected defendants' contention that the charges against them, in the absence of the statute, would have been indictable as common law offenses. The court held that the offenses charged did not offend against the public peace, morals, or economy, or the due regulation and domestic order of the Commonwealth. Although the legislature regulated the business of mining for the safety of miners, it was only by virtue of the statute that the failure to act in accordance therewith was made a punishable offense. The fact that the legislature declared the violations to have been misdemeanors, did not make them indictable offenses.</SPAN></P>

There was no evidence produced at trial to show that defendant was placed in any fear or that he shot the victim while under the influence of such fear, and therefore the trial court was not required to instruct the jury on this issue. Evidence of prior offenses committed by defendant, including his court-martial record, were admissible to enable the jury to decide what penalty was appropriate for defendant. The court had no authority to inquire into or review defendant's court-martial record, which was res judicata and conclusive on the court. Defendant's conviction of three separate offenses of violence was properly admitted into evidence.

The court held that any traffic increase with its attendant noise, dirt, danger and hazards was unpleasant, yet, such increase was one of the inevitable accompaniments of suburban progress and of the constantly expanding population which, standing alone, did not constitute a sufficient reason to refuse a property owner the legitimate use of his land, and there was nothing in the contemplated use of that site of land by appellant that would depreciate or change the character of the neighborhood anymore than would the establishment of any other school, church or philanthropic institution in the district. The court noted that any use of the site would affect, consequently, the township, in that it would require the widening of streets, and the fact that appellant owned another site that in the lower court's opinion was more suitable was irrelevant, thus, the judgment was reversed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were banking institutions in contiguous counties. Articles of Merger were filed by appellants and approved by the Department of State. The Articles were transmitted to the Department of Banking (Department) for approval or disapproval. One of the appellants had its principal and sole place of business in one county. The other appellant had its principal place of business, together with three branches, in another county. Appellants challenged the order that disapproved the proposed merger stating that there was no need for a merger since the banking facilities and services in one of the counties were adequate, and a merger would result in over-banking and would be detrimental to the community. On appeal, the court examined the Act of December 30, 1955, Pa. Laws 920, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 7, &sect; 819-204.1, which repealed an earlier act; specifically, the court looked at &sect; 204.1 A and B. Department misinterpreted &sect; 204.1 A. Yet, the appeal, pursuant to 7 P.S. &sect; 819-1406 C, was permissible only in the nature of a narrow certiorari; the proceedings by Department were regular and it had jurisdiction. Still the order was reversed due to an exercise of excess of powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the order and directed the Department of Banking to approve the Articles of Merger and notify the Department of State of its action because the court was not precluded from reversing an order of an administrative agency where an excess of powers, powers beyond those granted or possessed, was exercised by such an agency, like in the case here.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, life beneficiaries, sought review of a decree entered in the Orphans' Court, Montgomery County (Pennsylvania), which dismissed their petition for review of an adjudication and schedule of distribution previously confirmed by the trial court. Appellees, a guardian and trustee ad litem, denied the beneficiaries had the right of the review sought. The beneficiaries claimed that the trial court erred in dismissing their petition.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The beneficiaries claimed that since the time the schedule of distribution had been entered they learned that stock dividends, stock exchanges, and stock rights, which were included in the principal account, was an error of law and that the same should have been apportioned and included in income rather than in principal. The trial court refused the review because it deemed unmeritorious the reason offered by the beneficiaries for not having raised at the time of the audit their right to apportionment as income the receipts in question. The court reversed. The right of any party in interest to a review of a fiduciary's account, auditor's report, adjudication, or decree of distribution within five years after the final confirmation of the account was allowed by &sect; 721 of the Fiduciaries Act of 1949, P.L. 512, Pa. Stat. Ann. tit. 20, &sect; 320.721. The petition was filed within the five-year time limitation. No part of the property erroneously allocated in the account to principal had been distributed. The action of the trial court was in disregard of the plain intent of the Fiduciaries Act and constituted a manifest abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed and the record was remanded with directions that the petition be reinstated and a decree entered that granted the review prayed for.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee advertiser applied for a permit to erect a billboard on leased premises. Appellant Zoning Board of Adjustment (board) denied the request.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city alleged that the erection of a billboard on leased premises was not an accessory use and was not permitted by the zoning ordinance. The advertiser alleged that its billboard was an accessory use and that a refusal to permit such a sign by a lessee was a restriction that bore no substantial relation to public health, safety, morals, or general welfare and was unconstitutional. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court. The only signs expressly permitted by the zoning ordinance were those specifically enumerated or those that could have been classified as an accessory use. A billboard devoted to general advertising without reference to the businesses situated in the immediate community was not an accessory use. The contemplated use of the leased premises bore no relationship to the occupancy of the building on the subject premises, was not one incidental to the operation of the business and was, therefore, forbidden by the ordinance. There was no illegal discrimination in the ordinance. The unique nature of outdoor advertising justified the separate classification of such structures for the purposes of governmental regulation and restriction.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that Pa. Const. art.

The court explained that whether a school district's transportation of non-public school pupils to and from its public school in public school buses would have constituted a violation of art. X, &sect; 2 could not have properly come before the court until the legislature authorized or permitted such a practice. The court concluded that, in any event, the appeal had to be quashed because appellant lacked standing to appeal. The court explained that the litigation initiated by the declaratory judgment petition was conclusively determined by the lower court and a final judgment entered therein before the petition for intervention was ever filed, so intervention was no longer allowable.</SPAN></P>

The stockholder contended that the company's by-law and &sect; 1 of 1887 Pa. Laws 411, by which it was authorized, were invalid because they conflicted with the state constitution. The decree was affirmed. The court concluded that constitution granted the right of cumulative voting, but it did not purport to insure the maximum effectiveness of the exercise of that right to obtain minority representation on the board of directors. The constitution was silent as to how many candidates there should be at the election, whether they must consist of all the directors of the corporation, or whether they could not be classified and their elections staggered. The court concluded that to write into the constitution any such limiting or qualifying provisions as contended for by the stockholder would be an extreme exercise of judicial legislation.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a law that purported to be an exercise of a city's police power must not have been unreasonable, unduly oppressive, or patently beyond the necessities of the case. In addition, the means employed must have had a real and substantial relation to the objects sought to have been attained. The court stated that a city did have the power to control rents and evictions by ordinance when an emergency existed. The question was whether such emergency existed.

The trial court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision, holding that the proper procedure for challenging the validity of the zoning ordinance was to await an application for a permit and then file a complaint with the zoning board. An appeal to the court could then be had. Because the remedy provided in 1806 Pa. Laws &sect; 13 was the exclusive remedy, and it had to be strictly followed, the court dismissed the complaint.

The taxpayers alleged that the paying of funds was unconstitutional under Penn. Const. art. III, &sect; 18, which prohibited appropriations for charitable purposes or to any denominational or sectarian institution. The trial court entered a decree enjoining the institution district from paying the sectarian and denominational institutions, and enjoining each institution from receiving payment from the institution district. An appellate court reversed the trial court's decision, and one taxpayer sought review. On appeal, the court held that payments made by the institution district for the support and maintenance of neglected or dependent children were not appropriations within the meaning of that term as employed in &sect; 18. The court affirmed the appellate court's holding and found that the payments by the institution district to the sectarian homes did not violate the Due Process Clause.</SPAN></P>

The city claimed that the Fourteenth Amendment made the restriction to white children unconstitutional. The court held: 1) that the decedent was entitled to prescribe a method of selection for admission to the college unless there was a violation of an affirmative provision of law; 2) that private trusts for charitable purposes, not subject to or controlled by state action, were beyond the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment; 3) that the city's fiduciary duties were separate from its ordinary governmental functions; 4) that the administration of the trust by the city did not represent state action; 5) that even if the city were deemed to have engaged in state action, the trust did not fail, and the remedy was the substitution of another trustee; and 6) that the doctrine of cy pres was inapplicable because the objects of the trust were capable of being enforced.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that the essential rights of the First Amendment were subject to the elemental need for order and were not absolute. The court determined that Rule 6084's regulation of the area outside of the courtroom was reasonable. The freedom of the press was not abridged by an order prohibiting newspapermen from seeing and hearing what transpired in a courtroom because they had no special right or privilege not possessed by other members of the public.

The lower court granted an injunction and the court affirmed the decision.

The court held that the payment of the benefits without judicial review violated due process under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1, and Pa. Const. art. I, &sect; 9. Because payment of benefits under 43 P.S. &sect;&sect; 822, 824 would have resulted in irreparable harm to the contributors because retrieval of the funds would have been from the employees, equitable relief was appropriate.
