<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff brought suit against defendant for medical malpractice. The basis of her claim was that defendant gave her silicone based breast implants even though he had represented to her that the implants were saline based.

The trial court denied defendant summary judgment, but on appeal the order was reversed and remanded. On transfer, the court held that the two-year medical malpractice statute of limitations was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs who are unable to discover their medical malpractice claims before the expiration of the limitations period. Even though plaintiff did not discover her claim until eight years after her operation, she still brought it within the limitations period.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment that was granted by the trial court and affirmed by the court of appeals. Plaintiff appealed. The court held that the two-year medical malpractice statute of limitations should not have been applied to plaintiff because plaintiff was unable to discover the claim before its expiration.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant participated in beating a man to death. After pleading guilty, he challenged the trial court's imposition of the maximum sentence of 60 years for murder and 30 years for conspiracy to commit robbery, to run concurrently. On appeal, the court held the sentencing court was not obliged to consider defendant's extreme voluntary alcohol and drug intoxication as a mitigating factor in sentencing. Since evaluating the extent of intoxication is a factual matter, it was best left to the sentencing court's discretion. Even though this case resulted after a post-conviction reversal and retrial, the current sentencing court was not bound by the previous sentencing court's determination that defendant's intoxication did serve as a mitigating factor. The sentencing court was permitted to consider defendant's prior juvenile adjudications as an aggravating factor, except for a juvenile proceeding that ended without disposition. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court upheld defendant's maximum sentence for murder, because whether to regard defendant's extreme voluntary intoxication as a mitigating factor was a factual determination within the sentencing court's discretion.</SPAN></P>

The Court of Appeals affirmed and defendant sought further review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his battery and robbery convictions, claiming a violation of Indiana's Double Jeopardy Clause, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect;14. The court limited its review to the &quot;same offense&quot; facet of double jeopardy jurisprudence. The court superseded many earlier decisions by adopting the actual evidence test and the statutory elements test, holding that both must be analyzed to determine if two or more convictions are of the same offense. The court applied the Indiana Constitution, noting that it afforded broader double jeopardy protection that did the U.S. Constitution. The court found that defendant demonstrated a reasonable possibility that the evidentiary facts used by the jury to establish the essential elements of robbery were also used to establish the essential elements of the battery. Holding that both convictions could not stand, the court vacated the conviction and sentence with the less severe penal consequences, the battery conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated defendant's battery conviction and sentence because of a double jeopardy violation.</SPAN></P>

The court applied state's applicable two-part test in determining ineffective assistance of counsel, and held trial counsel's actions did not, either separately or cumulatively, rise to the level of ineffective assistance. The court then held defendant failed to prove he did not voluntarily waive his right to be present at his trial when he refused to reenter courtroom.

The court affirmed and held that plaintiffs were required to file the action within two years of discovering the cause of action, which they did. The medical malpractice statute of limitations applied to dental malpractice because defendants were health care providers. Defendants' duty to warn and adequately explain the risks extended to former patients.

The court of appeals reversed, holding that the fraudulent concealment doctrine allowed plaintiff to avoid the statute of limitations and that, in any event, the statute of limitations was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court agreed with the result reached by the court of appeals and reversed the trial court's judgment. However, the court upheld the facial constitutionality of the statute of limitations and concluded that it was unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs filed suit against defendants, the sheriff and prosecutor of a county in Indiana, contending that the Indiana Seatbelt Enforcement Act, Ind.

The trial court held that the statute violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 11 and permanently enjoined defendants from enforcing it. On appeal, the court agreed that the police may not enforce the seat belt law in violation of the state constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and searches and held that an Indiana police officer may not stop a motorist to enforce the seat belt law unless the officer observes circumstances that would cause an ordinary person to agree that the driver or passenger is not wearing a seat belt. However, the court determined that the statute could be applied in conformity with its holding and concluded that the statute was constitutional.

The county election board chairman asserted that if plaintiff spent over $ 100 on its hotline recording message it would be required to follow the rules for political action committees (PACs). The district court denied plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction, holding that plaintiff was not a PAC under Indiana law. Ind. Code &sect; 3-5-2-37 did not apply to organizations engaged only in issue advocacy, and plaintiff by its own definition engaged only in issue advocacy. Plaintiff appealed, contending that the district court erred in holding that the PAC definition applied only to express advocacy groups. The court of appeals certified a question regarding whether the statutory definition of a PAC included only those organizations which make contributions or expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate or a public question. The court construed the statute narrowly and answered in the affirmative.</SPAN></P>

Alerted to the discrepancy, defendant printed an apology although the headline did not indicate that the apology was a retraction. Plaintiff sued defendant for defamation. The trial court entered judgment for plaintiff. The court of appeals reversed, finding that plaintiff did not produce clear and convincing evidence of actual malice. On appeal, the court affirmed. Where the alleged defamation addressed a subject of public concern, the actual malice standard was required in cases involving private individuals, in addition to public figures. Plaintiff's evidence was insufficient to meet the clear and convincing evidence standard. The use of the word &quot;rats&quot; in the headline rather than &quot;rodents&quot; did not indicate actual malice because defendant was not shown to have known of the inaccuracy before publication.</SPAN></P>

Action was before the court on a previously granted petition to transfer, which thereby vacated the opinion of the lower appellate court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant city, which held a sewer and drainage easement on plaintiff's property, commenced building sewage and drainage structures within its easement. Defendant's project created a concrete drain in a natural ravine, although a recorded covenant prohibited the alteration of the ravine. Plaintiffs sought an injunction requiring defendant to remove the structures. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, and the motion was granted. Plaintiffs appealed, and the appellate court reversed with directions for the suit to proceed as a public lawsuit. Defendant's petition to transfer was granted and the court affirmed the trial court, holding that declaratory and injunctive relief was unavailable to plaintiffs. According to the court, equitable relief was not available to enjoin an alleged taking of private property for a public use, duly authorized by law, when a suit for compensation could be brought against the city; and the lower appellate court erroneously declared the plaintiffs' lawsuit a public lawsuit because the plaintiffs had not brought suit in their capacity as taxpayers, but rather, were seeking an injunction to protect their private property rights.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of murder in the Marion Superior Court (Indiana) and, upon denial of post-conviction relief, appellant sought review and asserted errors involving ex parte jury communication, non-disclosure of exculpatory evidence, jury instructions, admission of confession, assistance of counsel, mental health evaluations, death penalty issues, exclusion of evidence, and violation of due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of murder and received the death penalty. Upon the denial of post-conviction relief, appellant asserted multiple errors. The court found that evidence submitted regarding an alleged ex parte communication to the jury did not lead unmistakably and unerringly to a conclusion contrary to the post-conviction court's decision. An exculpatory evidence claim was without merit where review of the record demonstrated that the information was available to appellant through the exercise of reasonable diligence. The court held there was no error in jury instructions where the jury was clearly instructed to acquit in the presence of reasonable doubt. As to a claim that a confession was improperly admitted, the court found that there was nothing to indicate that the confession was unreliable or involuntary. In addition, the evidence did not show ineffective assistance of counsel at trial or on appeal. The court also declined to find constitutional infirmity, and rejected appellant's claim that his conviction and death sentence were unreliable and fundamentally erroneous. The court accordingly affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the denial of appellant's petition for post-conviction relief. The court held that appellant failed to show any substantive, procedural, or constitutional violations after the jury convicted him of murder and sentenced him to death, and appellant was not denied effective assistance of counsel at trial or on appeal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review from the Lake Superior Court (Indiana) where he was convicted of murder and felony murder and was sentenced to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant was convicted of murder and felony murder and was sentenced to death. Appellant sought review and contended that the mental retardation exemption from the death penalty applied, that he received ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel, that he was denied a fair post-conviction forum, and that an accumulation of alleged errors warranted relief. On review, the court found that appellant was not a mentally retarded individual within the meaning of Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9. As to appellant's arguments of ineffective assistance of counsel, the court examined the record and determined that it would not substitute judgment on strategic decision made by appellant's counsel and that there was no showing that the performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. The court found that mitigation evidence was available but never presented to the jury or the sentencing court and held that in such a situation the death sentence imposed would be unfair and unreliable. The court reversed in this regard and remanded for a new penalty phase.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellant's convictions were affirmed because appellant did not meet the definition of a mentally retarded individual and because his counsel's performance did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. However, the court reversed and remanded for a new penalty phase because mitigation evidence was available but never presented, thus making the death sentence imposed unfair and unreliable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction for dealing in cocaine in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-1, a class A felony; possession of cocaine in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-6, a class C felony; possession of marijuana in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-11, a class A misdemeanor; and two counts of resisting law enforcement in violation of Ind.

Code &sect; 35-48-4-11; and two counts of resisting law enforcement in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-44-3-3. He appealed, arguing there was insufficient evidence for the conviction and that the trial court erred in failing to suppress improperly seized evidence. Here, the trial court proved that defendant had constructive possession of the drugs by showing that defendant had both the intent to maintain dominion and control and the capability to maintain dominion and control over the drugs. Defendant's exclusive possession of the vehicle when police stopped it was sufficient to raise a reasonable inference of intent. As for defendant's argument that the trial court erred in failing to suppress evidence secured during a police inventory search of the vehicle incident to impoundment, Ind. Code &sect; 9-18-2-43(a) (1993) required the officer to take the vehicle into custody because it bore a stolen license plate. An inventory search was required before the vehicle could be towed. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court affirmed the decision of the trial court. Appellant received effective assistance from both his trial and appellate counsel because appellant was unable to show deficient counsel performance or resulting prejudice. Counsel did not err by failing to file a motion to have appellant tried separately from his co-defendant. Appellant had no absolute right to separate trial and even if a motion for separate trials had been filed, the trial court judge would have been within his discretion if he denied it. The jury was within its discretion in sentencing appellant to death because the trial court gave the jury sufficient and nonconfusing instructions. There was sufficient evidence that appellant formed the required mens rea and that he was able to appreciate the criminality of his conduct, because no mental disease or defect prevented such a formation. Aggravating factors outweighed mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

The petition was denied, and defendant again appealed, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel, that the trial court failed to give jury instructions regarding sentencing options, and the post-trial court improperly refused admission of expert testimony. The reviewing court affirmed, holding defendant's trial and appellate counsel rendered effective assistance. Where trial counsel failed to fully review discovery materials, this was harmless error where defendant was convicted of felony murder and disputing the evidence would not have changed the verdict. The sentencing jury instruction was not improperly denied where the law at the time of trial did not support the instruction.

The post-trial court properly denied expert testimony where it was cumulative and irrelevant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee taxpayer filed a petition to challenge its property tax assessment. Neither the county board of review (county) or the appellant state board of tax commissioners (state board) responded. The taxpayer filed an original appeal in the Indiana Tax Court. The state board moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The tax court denied the state board's motion and granted leave to file an interlocutory appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state board argued that the tax court lacked jurisdiction because it had never received the taxpayer's petition and never issued a final determination. The supreme court held that two questions emerged from the arguments: (1) whether the legislature intended to permit taxpayers to appeal to the tax court if the county did not act before the next reassessment; and (2) whether an omission of clear guidelines for county action effectively denied a taxpayer's right to review of an administrative determination to the extent that the scheme raised constitutional issues. A duty to act on a petition was imposed by the state's tax laws and any suit to enforce it had to be brought in the tax court. The proper party, however, was not the state board but the county officials who were charged to be in default of that duty. The tax court did not have jurisdiction to hear a direct appeal by a taxpayer against the state board when the county failed to act on a petition within the statutory time frame. But, the tax court could entertain a mandamus action by the taxpayer to compel the county to act. There was no breach of due process under the statutory scheme.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The case was remanded with direction to grant the state board 's motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioner taxpayers brought an action against respondent Indiana State Board of Tax Commissioners (the Board), alleging that Indiana's statutory system of property taxation was unconstitutional. The Indiana Tax Court consolidated the petitions and after a bench trial found in favor of the taxpayers. The Board appealed the decision. On remand, the Tax Court entered its final judgment of unconstitutionality. The Board again appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board contended that the trial court erred in finding that Ind.

The Board further argued that it should not be required to consider evidence of wealth in assessing property value. The court found that 1) &sect; 6-1.1-31-6(c) was not unconstitutional because it did not limit property valuation to &quot;fair market value,&quot; but instead allowed tax assessors to consider other factors than those prescribed by the Board; 2) the Property Taxation Clause of the Indiana Constitution, Ind. Const. art. X, &sect; 1, required a system of assessment that and taxation based on uniformity, equality, and just valuation based on wealth; 3) the Property Taxation Clause did not require absolute and precise exactitude as to the uniformity and equality of each individual assessment; 4) the Board's existing cost schedules lacked any meaningful reference to property wealth and resulted in significant deviations from substantial uniformity and equality, and thus was unconstitutional; and 5) the trial court erred in requiring the Board to consider &quot;real world evidence &quot;in its future property tax assessments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent, a board of zoning appeals, sought review of a judgment from the Court of Appeals (Indiana). The court of appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment, which reversed respondent's denial of a request by petitioner landlords for an exemption from a city ordinance for petitioners' properties as pre-existing lawful nonconforming uses.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A city passed a zoning ordinance that limited the occupancy of dwellings in certain neighborhoods to three unrelated adults. The existing owners of two rental properties failed to register their nonconforming use. Respondent, a board of zoning appeals, denied a request by petitioners, the new landlords, for an exemption. The trial court reversed, and the court of appeals affirmed the trial court. The court reversed, holding that the ordinance was not an unconstitutional taking and that petitioners' due process rights were not violated. The ordinance, even though it provided for the forfeiture of unregistered nonconforming uses, was not a physical invasion and did not deny all economically productive use of the property. The registration requirement and the forfeiture sanction advanced a legitimate state interest; the city needed a mechanism to monitor nonconforming uses so that it could implement its development plan. Petitioners' property continued to have an economically viable use, even if that use was diminished. The court overruled the holding of Ailes v. Decatur County Area Planning Comm'n, 448 N.E.2d 1057 (Ind. 1983) that amortization provisions were per se unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that a city ordinance, which provided for the forfeiture of a prior nonconforming use if the property had not been duly registered, did not violate the takings clause or the due process clause of the Federal Constitution. The court thus reversed the court of appeals' judgment. Petitioner landlords were properly denied an exemption from the ordinance because their predecessors had not registered the nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff commission brought an action against defendant owner alleging that his building was in violation of the Marion County, Ind., Dwelling Districts Zoning Ordinance (1966). Both parties moved for summary judgment. The Marion Superior Court, Indiana, held there was a violation of the ordinance and granted the commission's motion. A divided court of appeals reversed. The supreme court granted a transfer of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A transfer was granted to consider the legal standards for evaluating changes in a legally established nonconforming use under a zoning ordinance. The supreme court held that the interpretation of ordinances that restricted the expansion of nonconforming uses turned in the first instance on the specific language of the relevant ordinance, giving its words their plain, ordinary, and usual meaning. Each municipality was, subject to constitutional limitations, free to enact an ordinance that limited the expansion of nonconforming uses in the manner and to the degree that it deemed appropriate. Here, the ordinance clearly demonstrated the intent of the county council to constrain the expansion of nonconforming uses. Under the federal constitution, the ordinance was not an unconstitutional taking as applied to the building. The superior court properly granted summary judgment in favor of the commission. Injunctive relief was appropriate in this case; however, the superior court was required to determine whether it was necessary to order that the building be remodeled, rather than simply enjoining the building's use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The grant of summary judgment was affirmed in part. The case was remanded for reconsideration of the proper scope for relief.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 35-36-9-2. The court held that the standard of proof set forth in Ind. Code &sect; 35-36-9-4, although arguably permitting the same type of erroneous determination of absence of mental retardation, did not offend a fundamental principle such as the right of a defendant not to stand trial while incompetent. Given that the clear and convincing standard of proof of Ind. Code &sect; 35-36-9-4 did not affect the fundamental procedural fairness of a defendant's trial, and that the U.S. and Indiana Constitutions did not prohibit the execution of a mentally retarded defendant, the court could not conclude that defendant's due process rights were violated. Upon review of the record, the court could not conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in finding defendant not to be mentally retarded within the meaning of the statute, and the court would not disturb the trial court's finding.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended on appeal that her statements to police during her custodial interrogation should have been suppressed and that the State made an impermissible use of her invocation of her Miranda rights. She also contended that the victim's bank records were inadmissible, her counsel rendered ineffective assistance, and her sentence was manifestly unreasonable. The court held that, although there were no findings on the record as to the denial of defendant's motion to suppress her statements, the trial court clearly found that defendant's testimony that she had requested counsel was not credible. Defendant's invocation of her right to counsel after her statement was recorded was not used by the State to create an inference of guilt. The State used the remarks as an implication of sinister knowledge. The bank records were properly offered and admitted as evidence of defendant's relationship with the victim. The defense counsel's representation was not ineffective. Finally, there was no showing of a manifest abuse of discretion by the trial court in its sentencing enhancement, which was based the trial court's determination of aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Defendant pulled out a pistol and shot the victim. Defendant chased the victim while shooting him. The victim fell to the ground, and defendant shot him again. The victim was unarmed and died of five gunshot wounds. Defendant was convicted of murder and sentenced to 60 years. Defendant appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting photographs of the victim taken after the murder. The court reasoned that the pictures were highly probative of defendant's claim that he acted in self-defense. The court also found no error in admitting a witness's pre-trial statement to police that she saw defendant running from the scene to impeach her testimony at defendant's trial.

The court held, however, that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague because the law put individuals on active notice of what the legislature considered to be a criminal gang, and that participation in those groups was prohibited. Additionally, the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad and it did not violate defendant's freedom of association guaranteed under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, 31, and U.S. Const. arts.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder and attempted murder and sentenced to death. Defendant sought post-conviction relief asserting that she was denied both exculpatory materials known to the State and effective assistance of counsel at trial and on appeal. The superior court denied relief. Upon review, the court noted that the State had an affirmative duty to disclose evidence favorable to defendant. However, the post-conviction relief process was not to be used for investigating possible claims but as a means to vindicate actual claims. The court found that the materials relating to defendant's IQ could not be reasonably taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in her conviction. The court found that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel where defendant failed to show deficient performance and resulting prejudice from the actions of her counsel. The court reiterated the fact that counsel was expected to use professional judgment, and the court would not conclude that a fair trial was denied unless the conviction or sentence resulted from a breakdown of the adversarial process that rendered the result unreliable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder in violation of Ind. Code &sect; 35-42-1-1 and attempted murder in violation of Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-42-1-1 and 35-41-5-1. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that defendant's retrial following a mistrial did not violate his right to protection against double jeopardy. The court determined that there was no evidence that the prosecutor intended to cause a mistrial. The court noted that although the prosecutor asked the officer open-ended questions about their conversations with defendant, he did not appear to solicit their testimony about defendant's request for an attorney. The court further found that there was no evidence of sudden heat that would have entitled defendant to an instruction on the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter. The court also ruled that defendant's assertion of the insanity defense did not create a serious evidentiary dispute about defendant's level of mens rea. The court reasoned that because a successful insanity defense would have acquitted defendant of any offense he may have committed, the defense did not entitle defendant to an instruction on the lesser-included offense of reckless homicide.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed error related to (1) prosecutorial misconduct, (2) ineffective assistance of counsel, and (3) various challenges to the facial validity of the death penalty statute. The court held that a claim of denial of counsel required proof not only of attorney deficiency, but also of fundamentally unfair and unreliable result. Because the alleged prosecutorial misconduct in failing to disclose the serology evidence did not present significant evidence in favor of defendant, the result was not unfair and unreliable. Furthermore, the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel was forfeited by the failure to raise it on direct appeal, and the court found no fundamental error. Additionally, it was apparent that the legislature's choice to allow death penalty defendants to present every conceivable mitigator required that the sentencer not be precluded from considering as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record. Therefore, the statutory &quot;catch-all&quot; mitigator did not violate constitutional requirements.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a bifurcated proceeding, defendant was convicted of two counts of dealing in drugs and then found to be a habitual offender under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-8 (Supp. 1986). During the habitual offender phase, the trial court instructed the jury that it was the judge only of the facts, and that it was restricted to determining the facts only and not the law. Defendant was found guilty of being a habitual offender, causing his sentence to be enhanced by 30 years. The post-conviction court denied relief and the Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed. On transfer of the appeal to the Supreme Court of Indiana, the court held that Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, which provides that the jury had the right to determine the law and the facts, was applicable to habitual offender proceedings. Thus, the jury was entitled to make a determination of habitual offender status as a matter of law independent of its factual determinations regarding prior unrelated felonies. However, because the error in the instruction of the jury was not fundamental, the court affirmed the denial of post-conviction relief.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant shot and killed his ex-girlfriend's grandparents and then kidnapped his ex-girlfriend, their child, and his wife and forced them to accompany him on his getaway. The trial court imposed the death penalty after defendant was convicted of murder and other charges. The court affirmed the convictions, but reversed the sentence, finding that the admission of prior bad acts under Ind. R. Evid. 404(b) was harmless error where there was no substantial likelihood that the erroneously admitted evidence contributed to the jury's conclusion that defendant killed the grandparents or that the jury would have found that defendant was guilty of reckless homicide and not murder. The trial court did not err in refusing to give a voluntary manslaughter instruction, as there was no evidence of provocation. Defendant waived his objection to jury voir dire questions by failing to object, and the prosecutor's discretion to seek the death penalty without a &quot;probable cause&quot; requirement or an adversarial hearing was constitutional. However, the court held that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that defendant could be sentenced to life without parole for the murders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The prisoner was convicted on the theory that he acted alone.

The court applied a two-part test to the prisoner's ineffective assistance claims of his trial and appellate counsel. The prisoner's assistance at all phases of his trial, sentencing, and direct appeal was not ineffective because the evidence did not show both deficient performance and resulting substantial prejudice to the prisoner. Trial counsel effectively employed the prisoner's mental condition to support his innocence defense. The jury was properly instructed regarding mitigating and aggravating circumstances regarding the death sentence.

Defendant appealed his convictions. The court affirmed, holding that the admission of his voluntary confession did not violate his right to be free from self-incrimination under Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 14, and that the police conduct in not honoring the attorney's unsolicited request did not violate his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the court held that while the trial court's finding of major participation in the crime satisfied the death penalty statute, particularly Ind.

On appeal, the court affirmed. Testimony regarding a telephone call from defendant's wife was improperly admitted, but the error was harmless because the testimony was merely cumulative. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting ballistics or serological evidence. The trial court did not err in refusing defendant's tendered jury instructions on accident or mistake of fact. The jury was not in fact misled by the jury instruction on reckless homicide. Although the instruction on prior inconsistent statements incorrectly stated the law, the error was harmless. The death penalty statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9, was constitutional. It was constitutional to impose the death sentence for &quot;knowing,&quot; as well as &quot;intentional,&quot; murder. The trial court failed to instruct the jury on all the statutory penalties for murder, but the omission was not fundamental error. The aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

As to his sentence, he asserted that prosecutorial misconduct again occurred, that the death penalty statute was unconstitutional, that jurors had undue discretion in deciding his fate, that the jury instructions were inadequate, that the proof of aggravators was insufficient, that the jury had not decided if he knew his victim's age, that counting overlapping aggravators artificially increased their weight, that considering prior uncharged misconduct was improper, and that his death sentence was inappropriate and comparatively disproportionate.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant sought review of his murder and felony murder convictions and imposition of the death penalty. The court affirmed the convictions, first rejecting the argument that appellant was entitled to severance of the offenses of the shotgun murder and robbery of a male victim, and the shotgun murder and robbery of a female victim two days later. The court found the lower court did not abuse its discretion in denying the severance motion under the statutory provisions at issue, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 35-34-1-9(a), -11(a) (1993), because the offenses were not joined solely based on their similarity. As a result, appellant was not entitled to severance as a matter of right. The court observed joinder was justified because the state could establish a modus operandi for the crimes which both involved shooting clerks at their place of business between the hours of six and eight at night by an assailant who drove a white Nissan Sentra. The court next rejected the argument that other crimes evidence was improperly admitted. The court explained that, assuming admission was error, it was nevertheless harmless due to the other overwhelming evidence against appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court held that defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel; the post-conviction court did not err in failing to grant an evidentiary hearing on the state's motion for summary judgment; the trial court did not fail to consider relevant mitigating evidence; defendant was not deprived of a fair trial due to allegedly erroneous jury instructions; the alleged errors at trial did not act cumulatively to deny defendant a fair trial; and Indiana's death penalty statute was not unconstitutional. The court rejected numerous theories presented by defendant challenging the constitutionality of the statute. As to any ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant failed, in part, to show that that his counsel acted below an objective standard of reasonableness, and that the substandard performance was so prejudicial as to deny him a fair trial. Further, summary judgment was proper where the state's agreement removed disputed facts, and the only inquiry remaining was one of law.

The court concluded that any errors in the admission or exclusion of evidence were harmless and that the trial court judge did not act partially or erroneously instruct the jury. The court held that defendant was not denied a fair trial because he received effective assistance of counsel, and that he was not denied a fair and impartial jury due to pre-trial publicity or the trial court's actions. Finally, the court held that the death penalty statute, codified at Ind.

Defendant then filed a petition for post-conviction relief (PCR). The PCR trial court denied defendant's petition, and defendant again appealed the ruling, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The court held that under the Strickland standard, defendant was required to show that, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions of counsel were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance, and that he suffered prejudice as a result of the deficient performance. Defendant argued that his counsel did not introduce mitigating evidence during the penalty phase of the trial and put him on the stand. The court stated that defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel, because counsel's actions were the result of trial strategy, and in any case, the result of the jury would have been the same.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, high school and principal, sought review of a judgment from the Indiana Court of Appeals, which upheld the validity of the Restitution Rule of defendant Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA). Plaintiffs asked the court to reinstate the trial court's prohibition against the IHSAA enforcing its Restitution Rule against plaintiff high school.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA) notified plaintiff high school that a student was not eligible to participate in interscholastic athletics due to the IHSAA's eight semester rule. After the student's request for a hardship exception was denied by the IHSAA, the trial court issued an injunction preventing the IHSAA from enforcing the rule against the student and prohibiting the IHSAA from sanctioning plaintiff for compliance with the injunction. The court of appeals reversed and plaintiff appealed only from the holding that the IHSAA's Restitution Rule was valid. The Restitution Rule provided that the IHSAA could sanction member schools by requiring them to forfeit awards and return funding in the event an ineligible student athlete participated in violation of IHSAA rules, but in accordance with a court order that was later stayed or reversed. On appeal the court affirmed and held that absent fraud, other illegality, or abuse of civil or property rights, it would not interfere in plaintiff's dispute with a voluntary association of which it was a member. Where the student did not challenge the IHSAA decision, the arbitrary and capricious standard did not apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the finding that the Restitution Rule of the Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA) was valid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed the denial of post-conviction relief concerning his conviction and death sentence by the Howard Superior Court (Indiana), which upheld his conviction and death sentence for murder after defendant's unsuccessful direct appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant unsuccessfully appealed his conviction for murder and resultant death sentence, he unsuccessfully petitioned for post-conviction relief. On appeal, the court affirmed and found no reversible error in the post-conviction court proceedings. The court held defendant's claims regarding ineffective assistance of counsel at the appellate and trial levels failed because: (1) defendant was unable to show a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's purportedly unprofessional presentation, the outcome of his appeal would have been different; (2) the appellate court's ruling in defendant's direct appeal was res judicata to his claim that trial counsel was ineffective; (3) appellate counsel was not required to challenge trial counsel's failure to ask the court for a cautionary instruction regarding an accomplice's testimony because under Indiana common law, this instruction was improper; (4) the failure to challenge jury instructions was not prejudicial because the instructions given were not error; (5) there was no error in jury selection; (6) he could not assert cumulative error during the penalty phase because those claims should have been raised on his direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction and sentence of death because thorough post-conviction review of the proceedings leading to defendant's conviction and sentence revealed no constitutional error by the trial court or in the performance of counsel either at trial or in his direct appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed new evidence showed that he was insane and that Indiana's statutory definition of insanity, Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-3-6 (1993), was unconstitutional because it failed to define volitionally impaired defendants, or those who acted in accordance with an &quot;irresistible impulse&quot; as insane. On appeal, the court affirmed the postconviction judgment holding that the claims that the death sentence was excessive based on new evidence of insanity was barred by res judicata as it did not meet the standard of new evidence sufficient to warrant a new trial. The court held that the issue of the constitutionality of the statute was barred as well as he had brought it up on direct appeal and lost. Finally, the court held that as to the issue of jurors being exposed to information about the plea negotiations, it was not reversible error to sit those jurors because the entire defense had focused on whether or not defendant was insane and not about whether he was guilty.</SPAN></P>

Following the jury's recommendation, the court sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed his conviction and death sentence. On appeal, the court affirmed both. The court noted that in post-conviction proceeding the defendant had to show that the evidence, when taken as a whole, was unerringly and unmistakably to a conclusion opposite to that reached by the trial court. The court found that evidence that defendant was previously competent to stand trial was properly available to the post-conviction court about defendant's mental state. The court found that the denial of defendant's motion to order the jury commissioner to disclose the names of the jurors and alternates at trial was properly denied. The court held the magistrate act was constitutional as it operated in the case. The court found no bias or prejudice against the defendant by the magistrate. The court held that defendant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel. The court reweighed the statutory aggravators and mitigators, also without consideration of the contents of the psychological questionnaire, and found that the death penalty was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state filed an interlocutory appeal from the decision of the Lake Superior Court (Indiana), which held that Ind. Code &sect; 35-47-2-23, classifying the crime of giving false information in an application for a handgun license as a class C felony, was facially unconstitutional as a violation of the proportionality requirement of Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged the constitutionality of the statute on the grounds that the penalty for giving a false address in an application for a handgun permit was the same as the penalty for actually carrying a handgun without a license. The trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The court noted that the separation of powers doctrine required it to take a highly restrained approach when reviewing a legislative prescription of punishment and that the statute began with a presumption of constitutional validity. In determining whether the penalty was disproportionate to the offense, the court compared it to the penalties for other crimes involving misinforming or deceiving public officials and found that it was consistent with the penalties in those cases. The court also held that the legislature may have regarded this as leading to the commission of two wrongs in that the offender first will have deceived a public official and second will carry a handgun without a valid permit. The court concluded that the trial court had impermissibly infringed upon the legislative prerogative when it held the statute unconstitutional on its face.</SPAN></P>

The court held that appellant's arguments did not demonstrate that appellant was sentenced to death in a tainted, unconstitutional proceeding. The reliability of appellant's convictions for robbery and felony murder were not undermined by his attorney's representation. The convictions flowed from the evidence, which was tested by cross-examination and interpreted for the jury in the argument of counsel. Appellant was not denied his right to effective assistance of counsel during the guilt phase of his trial. Further, the court held that there was little evidence that appellant was mentally retarded, and none that showed him to be incapable of appreciating the criminality of his conduct or to conform it to the law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was a passenger in a vehicle stopped by police for a traffic violation. The stop occurred within 1000 feet of a school. Defendant, after a consent search, was found in possession of drugs. Defendant also hid drugs in the back seat of a police car. Defendant appealed his conviction at trial, contending that the school-zone enhancement of his sentence violated his rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction because the school-zone enhancement was rationally related to the state's legitimate objective of preventing drug transactions from taking place around children. The court held that the language of the school-zone enhancement had provided defendant with clear and fair notice of what type of conduct was prohibited. The court found that contrary to defendant's arguments, the enhancement was triggered by the act of entering the school zone and that defendant's lack of knowledge as to the location of the school zone was irrelevant, because the school-zone element was a strict-liability enhancement. The court held that the evidence was sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's conviction, because the school-zone enhancement applied to defendant's conviction as a matter of statutory construction and the enhancement did not violate defendant's due process of law or equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Petitioners, the Madison County Unified Courts (Indiana) and the Madison Circuit Court (Indiana) (Court System), issued an order of mandate of funds, pursuant to Ind. R. Trial P. 60.5(B), to require respondent, Madison County Council (Indiana), to increase the salaries of Madison County probation officers. A specially assigned judge entered a decree sustaining the order of mandate. The proceedings were certified to the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Ind. Code &sect; 11-13-1-8(b) authorized the Board of Directors of the Judicial Conference of Indiana to prescribe minimum salary standards for probation officers. Ind. Code &sect; 11-13-1-1(c) authorized Indiana courts to fix the salaries of their probation officers. On appeal from the special judge's decree that confirmed petitioners' order of mandate, the County Council contended, among other things, that the Indiana legislature violated the principle of separation of powers, which was found in Ind. Const. art. III, &sect; 1, when it authorized the Board to establish minimum salary standards for probation officers. The court found no constitutional infirmity in the legislature's action. Because courts were constitutionally obligated to be open and because the operation of a probation office was a court-related function, the Indiana courts had the corresponding constitutional power to pay probation officers at a level sufficient to attract and maintain qualified personnel. The process by which probation officers' salaries were determined illustrated that the coordinate branches of government were working together; specifically, county officials attended hearings on the proposed salary increase.</SPAN></P>

The victim testified that she had not used drugs the day at issue or the day of trial, and the court found that the fact that the victim had used drugs, in and of itself, was not relevant. As to sexual history, the court found that such the trial court properly excluded testimony from a friend of the victim that on prior occasions the victim had committed acts of prostitution in exchange for money or cocaine. This was properly excluded because no exceptions to Indiana's Rape Shield Rule, Ind. R. Evid. 412, applied.</SPAN></P>

The court held that: (1) the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding sufficient indications of reliability under &sect; 35-37-4-6 to support admission of the witnesses' testimony because the victim's statements were spontaneous and occurred shortly after the molestation; (2) the videotaped statement was cumulative of statements that she made to the witnesses following the incident; (3) defendant was not denied his right to confront the victim because she was available for cross-examination at the competency hearing but defendant failed to question her; and (4) given its safeguards against admission of untrustworthy evidence, &sect; 35-37-4-6 did not violate Ind.

Defendant's confinement with older, hardened criminals did not violate Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 18. The only youths who were not subject to the general rule prohibiting their confinement to an adult correctional facility were those alleged to have committed the most serious and violent crimes. It was within the legislature's purview to conclude that this system better accommodated the purposes behind Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 18 and Ind. Const. art. 9 &sect; 2, because it segregated younger and less violent offenders from the most violent offenders, regardless of age. The 60-year sentence was not an abuse of discretion. The record amply supported the finding that defendant could control his actions, there were several aggravating factors, and a sentencing court needed only a single aggravating factor to justify imposing an enhanced sentence. No manifest injustice resulted from the trial court's denial of defendant's request to withdraw his guilty plea. A misstatement regarding the possible sentence did not prejudicially influence defendant's decision to plead guilty.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature attached riders to 1995 Ind. H.E.A. 1598 (HEA 1598), a renamed environmental bill, to amend the Prevailing Wage Act. The legislature later passed 1995 Ind. H.E.A. 1435 (HEA 1435) to amend &quot;Ind.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant, Indiana State Board of Tax Commissioners, challenged the decision of the Indiana Tax Court, which held that the state constitution required a system of property assessment and taxation based on market value and that, because the statutory system of taxation valued real property on a basis other than market value, the system was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Board contended that the statutory taxation systems was not unconstitutional because Ind. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1 committed the design of a property taxation system to the legislative branch. The court found that the language of art. 10 &sect; 1, along with the circumstances of its adoption, clearly demonstrated that the framers did not intend to give the legislature unrestrained discretion as to the laws of assessment and taxation. Therefore, the tax court did not err in undertaking to determine if the state system complied with constitutional prerequisites. However, the court agreed with the Board's contention that the tax court erroneously concluded that art. 10, &sect; 1 required the state system of real property assessment and taxation to be based on a system which used market value as the measure of equality and uniformity. The court held that although this method of assessment came closest to constitutional requirements for uniform and equal rates and for just valuation, a system based solely upon strict fair market value was not expressly required either by the text of the constitution, by the purpose and intent of its framers, or by subsequent case law.</SPAN></P>

The postconviction court also vacated the inmate's death sentence, but the state did not appeal that part of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate shot the victim when he and three companions attempted to steal a television, which the victim had set up in his yard so that he could watch the World Series while he caulked a window. After a lengthy sentencing hearing, the trial court sentenced the inmate to death. The postconviction court held that the inmate was denied effective assistance of counsel because his trial lawyer failed to uncover relevant evidence that, if discovered, would have caused the inmate to go to trial instead of entering a plea. The court reversed and held that the postconviction court erred as a matter of law in setting aside the conviction. The court held that in order to establish a constitutional claim, the inmate had to demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would not have been convicted at trial. The court held that the mitigating evidence the inmate's lawyer failed to uncover, although relevant to the inmate's intent to kill, did not establish a reasonable probability of a different result had the inmate gone to trial because his intent to commit the robbery was never in doubt and the state would not have been required to prove intent to kill to obtain a felony murder conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the postconviction court's order vacating defendant's conviction for felony murder, reinstated defendant's felony conviction, and remanded the case for a new sentencing hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state challenged an order from the Lawrence Circuit Court (Indiana) that issued a declaratory judgment finding that the Controlled Substance Excise Tax, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 6-7-3-1 to 6-7-3-20 (1993 &amp; Supp. 1996), violated the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const. amend. V.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant state sought to collect taxes from appellee drug possessor under the Controlled Substance Excise Tax (CSET) and recorded a judgment lien against his interests including property he owned with appellee tenants-in-common. Appellee drug possessor later pleaded guilty to marijuana possession. Appellee tenants-in-common filed an action to partition the property, and appellee drug possessor filed a constitutional cross-claim. The circuit court found that CSET violated the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const. amend. V, but on appeal, the court reversed, holding that a court of general jurisdiction lacked authority to entertain a constitutional challenge to a tax. The court concluded that the Tax Court's jurisdiction over such a claim was exclusive because the case arose under the Indiana tax laws and the original tax appeal was for a final determination that the tax was owed. Taxpayers were required to pursue all administrative remedies before seeking judicial review even if the review sought to challenge the constitutionality of a tax statute. Thus, appellee drug possessor could not bypass the Tax Court and seek a remedy directly in the circuit court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a judgment from the LaPorte Circuit Court (Indiana), which convicted defendant upon a jury verdict of aiding in a felony murder in violation of Ind. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 35-42-1-1(2) (Supp. 1996), 35-41-2-4 (1986).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant's friend killed the victim during a robbery after defendant gave her friend substantial information about the victim, who was defendant's neighbor, and the victim's house. Defendant did not accompany her friend to the victim's house. Defendant argued that the evidence was insufficient to establish that she aided her friend in robbing the victim and, therefore, she could not be held liable as an accomplice for the murder that arose out of the robbery. The court affirmed the conviction, concluding that a reasonable trier of fact could find that defendant aided her friend in robbing the victim. The court found that defendant's actions before, during, and after the commission of the crime suggested guilt. The court also rejected defendant's contentions that the use of an alias in the jury instructions was prejudicial error, that the admission of certain photographs was prejudicial, and that the jury instructions did not adequately inform the jury on the burden of proof. The court, however, remanded for resentencing, finding that the valid aggravating factors did not outweigh the mitigating factors as to justify the maximum sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed a judgment that convicted defendant of aiding in a felony murder.

The defendant challenged, inter alia, the trial courts denial of his peremptory challenges, the limitation on the employment of defense experts, the denial of his motion for a continuance. The court concluded that it was within the discretion of the trial courts to manage and control the proceedings to intervene to protect the jurors' rights to serve on the jury. As to the claim that the trial court abused its discretion by limiting the mitigation expert to 25 hours of investigation, the court agreed with the defendant that under Ind. R. Crim. P. 24(C), the trial court had no authority to limit the expert's time so severely. However, the court did not find the trial court's error in this regard to require reversal as defendant was able to effectively present mitigation evidence to the jury during the penalty phase and to the court at sentencing. Because it was not reversible error for the trial court to deny the mitigation specialist additional hours, it was also not reversible error for the trial court to deny the motion for a continuance for further investigation into mitigation evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court held that any error in receiving the testimony or the victim impact evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and it found mitigating and aggravating factors correctly applied. The court found that the jury was properly charged and that the sentences were not disproportionate.

The court of appeals held that the statute was fundamentally unfair because the board could be expected to give greater credence to the arguments of one of its members. The court held that the procedure did not violate due process. A presumption of honesty and integrity applied to the members of administrative bodies and there was no showing of bias or prejudice on the part of the members who made the decision to discharge the officer. The suggestion by the court of appeals that city attorneys should not serve on such boards was impractical because their legal expertise was needed in performing the myriad tasks assigned by statute to the boards. The police chief's suggestion that the officer take a polygraph examination did not constitute a stipulation that its results would be admissible and the trial court had not erred in excluding that evidence.</SPAN></P>

The Honorable Gene E. Brooks, Judge. No. EV 94-95-C.  </SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee creditor challenged the exemption of individual retirement accounts from the assets of appellant debtors. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana certified two questions to the court: Whether Ind. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 27-1-12-14(c), 34-2-28-1(a)(6) (Supp. 1991) violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 22, by failing to impose a cap on the exempt amount.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The debtors sought to exempt their individual retirement accounts (IRA) from their debtor estate and thereby make those monies unreachable by the creditor. These certified questions caused the court to revisit the constitutionality of statutes exempting a debtor's property from the pool of assets available to creditors. The court examined held that the Indiana Constitution required that the legislature fashion exemptions of a debtor's property from the pool of assets available to creditors in reasonably tangible ways designed to balance the interests of debtors and lenders. Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 34-2-28-1(a)(6) (Supp. 1991) made explicit reference to an amount certain and readily ascertainable in the Internal Revenue Code, which was a reasonably tangible way to describe the amount of the exemption, and therefore complied with Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. Although the Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-12-14(c) exemption on individual retirement accounts was constitutional, the Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 27-1-12-14(c) exemption for life insurance was constitutionally suspect and may be claimed only upon proof that the exemption was required to afford the necessities of life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court concluded that the statutory exemption on individual retirement accounts was constitutional, but the exemption for life insurance was constitutionally suspect and may be claimed only upon proof that the exemption was required to afford the necessities of life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants, State of Indiana and Department of Revenue (State), appealed the judgment of the Tippecanoe Circuit Court (Indiana), which held that Pub. L. No. 44-1994 violated Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect;&sect; 22, 23. Plaintiff taxpayers had brought the action in the lower court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">One county in Indiana had received notice that it was a potentially responsible party (PRP) for a superfund landfill site and could be responsible for the expensive cleanup of the landfill. The General Assembly enacted Pub. L. No. 44-1994 which only applied to counties within a narrowly specified population range, and the only county with that population was the county that received the PRP notice. Pub. L. No. 44-1994 permitted the specified county to increase the economic development income tax rate. The lower court held that Pub. L. No. 44-1994 violated Indiana's constitution, and the court reversed. The court held that even though Pub. L. No. 44-1994 was a special law, it did not violate Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 22 because the enactment did not authorize new property valuations. The court ruled that the specified county had a unique exposure to superfund liability, and, therefore, Pub. L. No. 44-1994 was not a matter necessarily subject to a general law uniformly applicable in all counties. Consequently, Pub. L. No. 44-1994 did not violate Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 23.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court, which held that Indiana's Constitution prohibited the law which only permitted one county to raise its economic development income tax rate. The case was remanded for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">While the mother was married, she had a sexual relationship with her neighbor.

The trial court approved an agreed entry stating that the neighbor was the child's biological father and arranging for joint custody and no child support at the time. The mother then moved to set aside the agreed entry pursuant to Ind. R. Trial P. 60(B)(6). The trial court denied the motion, and the appellate court found the trial court lacked jurisdiction. On further appeal, the court found the trial court had jurisdiction. Although the child was born while the mother was married, the child was born out of wedlock because the mother was not married to the neighbor. Thus, the neighbor could file a paternity action under Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-6.1-2 (1993 &amp; Supp. 1995). Although the child was not named in the paternity action and no guardian ad litem was appointed, the agreed entry was merely voidable, not void. The trial court did not err in refusing to set it aside. The agreement did not contract away the child's right to support from a parent.</SPAN></P>

Both the trial court and the appellate court failed to consider the relative financial positions of the spouses. The court held that the enforcement of the antenuptial agreement would leave appellee with virtually all of the real and personal property, while leaving appellant with a modest income stream.

After persuading defendant to stop at a gas station, the girlfriend asked a young woman in the restroom to call the police. When the police arrived, defendant was arrested and searched. Defendant argued that the trial court improperly admitted the evidence that was seized from his person. The court held that the trial court did not err, as the warrantless search was incident to a lawful arrest. Defendant was &quot;arrested&quot; because the police had reasonable caution to believe that defendant had, at minimum, committed a felony; namely, they received a call that a man was holding a woman against her will with a handgun, and the girlfriend asked the police for help when they approached defendant. The trial court did not err in admitting tapes from interviews that defendant gave to reporters after his arrest, as Miranda warnings were not necessary because the reporters were not acting as agents of the police.</SPAN></P>

He alleged in part that he had been denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, and to trial within 180 days of filing his Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) request for final disposition. The murder charge was nearly 30 years old. He had been in a Missouri prison following his conviction on a murder charge.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1965 defendant was arrested in Texas and admitted to killing a cabdriver in Indiana. He was transferred to Missouri because of his admitted involvement in a murder there. An Indiana warrant was issued. Nearly 10 years later a detainer was lodged with regard to a second Indiana murder. Defendant was then serving a life sentence in Missouri, and filed his IAD request for final disposition on that charge. In 1990 Indiana commenced the action regarding the cabdriver's murder and filed a detainer against defendant. In 1992 he filed a motion to dismiss, and in 1993 filed his IAD request for final disposition. The motion to dismiss was denied, and the trial was conducted after defendant and the state requested continuances. Defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and he appealed. The court held that he was not denied his right to a speedy trial because the right did not attach until the formal indictment or information was filed. His right attached in 1990, and he was tried in 1994. The delay was not prejudicial and did not impair his defense of the case. He was tried within the 180-day IAD requirement because his 1973 IAD notice did not pertain to the murdered cabdriver.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana certified certain questions about the medical emergency exception to Indiana's new abortion law, Public Law 187, 1995 Ind. Acts 3327, to resolve a facial challenge to the abortion law's constitutionality brought by plaintiff abortion providers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The abortion providers argued that, based on the rules of statutory construction, the medical emergency exception to Public Law 187 should be construed very narrowly. Defendant attorney general claimed that the medical emergency exception was crafted to conform with the medical emergency exception in the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act, 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 3203-3220 (1980 &amp; Supp. 1996) and that its language supported an interpretation consistent with federal court decisions on abortion. The court answered the certified questions as follows: 1) a woman may be excepted from compliance with the statutory informed consent provisions contained in Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 16-34-2-1.1 when she faces significant and imminent threats to her life or health; 2) Public Law 187 allows only death or substantial and irreversible impairment to excuse compliance with its informed consent provisions, and severe-but-temporary conditions in which an abortion is not the medically necessary treatment was not covered by the exception; and 3) compliance with Public Law 187's informed consent provisions may be excused when compliance threatens to cause the woman severe psychological harm.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court answered the certified questions relating to the Indiana abortion law, stating that the medical emergency provision permitted dispensing with the informed consent requirements where the attending physician deemed therapeutic abortion medically necessary. The court held that such exception applied to only serious and physical and mental health issues, not to temporary health problems.</SPAN></P>

The LaGrange Circuit Court (Indiana) preliminarily enjoined the project. The town appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Believing that the town's construction of a sanitary sewer system would cause environmental damage to a river, the landowners brought an action against the town to enjoin the town from building the system. The trial court granted a preliminary injunction, but the court vacated the injunction and ordered that the landowners' complaint be dismissed. The water pollution control and facility permitting statute, Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 13-1-3-1 to 13-1-3-22, 13-7-5-2 to 13-7-5-8, gave the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) authority to determine whether the town's project would comply with state water pollution standards. The court believed that, at the end of the permitting process, there would be no remaining issues to resolve. Therefore, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to grant the landowners' request for an injunction on the grounds of the public damage the project would cause. The trial court also lacked jurisdiction to grant an injunction on the grounds of the landowners' private property rights because the legislature had entrusted to IDEM the decision of whether to construct the project.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court vacated the preliminary injunction and remanded the action to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the landowners' complaint with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In his action for wrongful termination, the police officer alleged that his termination without a hearing violated Ind.

Code Ann. &sect; 36-8-3-4 were inapplicable because the police officer was offered an opportunity to request a hearing before his termination became effective but he declined. The court found that the police officer's due process rights were not violated because the police officer was given notice of the municipality's plan to terminate him, that notice informed him of his right to a hearing, and he chose not to request a hearing. The opportunity for a hearing was due process of law. Finally, the court also found that Ind. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee Indiana Department of State Revenue (department) assessed a drug tax against appellant taxpayers for possession of marijuana. The Indiana Tax Court found the assessment violated the double jeopardy protections of one taxpayer and reversed the assessment as to her. The taxpayers appealed, arguing equal protection and self-incrimination violations. The department appealed the ruling as to double jeopardy finding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">A police search of the home of the taxpayers, husband and wife, uncovered marijuana. Pursuant to the Indiana Controlled Substance Excise Tax (CSET), the department assessed a drug tax under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 6-7-3-6 (1994). The wife was then convicted of possession of marijuana. The taxpayers argued that the CSET violated the self-incrimination protection of the Fifth Amendment by forcing the wife to physically appear at the department's office to pay the fine. They alleged violation of the Due Process Clause because the property was seized without a hearing. The court held that the CSET was a punishment, and jeopardy attached at the time of assessment. The CSET did not violate the Fifth Amendment because the information could not be revealed to law enforcement or be used to facilitate prosecution. Moreover, the CSET did not require the payor's physical presence as anyone was entitled to pay the tax on behalf of the payor. As to the due process claim, the legislature properly found that the government's need to take immediate action justified the use of a post-deprivation hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the trial court's rulings that the taxpayers' equal protection, due process, and self-incrimination rights were not violated. The court reversed the trial court's ruling that the assessment violated the taxpayer's double jeopardy protections. The court found that the assessment was the taxpayer's first jeopardy, and it was the misdemeanor conviction that was barred. The court, thus, reinstated the assessment.</SPAN></P>

The judgment prescribed a suspended one and a half year prison sentence, placed defendant on probation for a year, and suspended defendant's driver's license, license plates, and ability to register a motor vehicle pursuant to Ind.

Code &sect; 35-48-4-15(a) (1994) made clear that the trial court was obligated to suspend defendant's driving privileges. The court held that the trial court's discretion extended only to the length of the suspension. Further, defendant chose to dispose of the charge against him by accepting a plea bargain and agreed to leave sentencing to the trial court's discretion. In balancing the factors of private interest, risk of erroneous deprivation, and governmental interest, there was no violation of defendant's procedural due process rights. Defendant's substantive due process rights were also not violated because there was no fundamental right to drive and &sect; 35-48-4-15(a) bore a rational relationship to the legitimate state interest in punishing lawbreakers and deterring lawbreaking.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed a decision by the Court of Appeals (Indiana), which affirmed his conviction on one count of child molestation and reversed his conviction on a second count of child molestation. He alleged that the lower court failed to address his argument that the state's expert testimony regarding the child sexual abuse syndrome was unreliable and unscientific, and thus, was inadmissible in his trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted on one count of child molestation, a class C felony under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-42-4-3(c) (1986), and convicted on one count of child molestation, a class D felony under Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-42-4-3(d) (1986). The court affirmed his conviction on the first count, reversed his conviction on the second count, and remanded the second count for a new trial. The court found that scientific evidence that child victims of sexual abuse exhibited unexpected behavior patterns apparently inconsistent with the claim of abuse was admissible under the authorization in Ind. R. Evid. 702(a) of specialized knowledge that would assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence. The court ruled that if defendant discussed or presented evidence of such child behavior, or if the child recanted a prior allegation of abuse, the trial court could consider permitting expert testimony based upon reliable scientific principles regarding the prevalence of such behavior. To be admissible, the scientific evidence would have to assist the factfinder in understanding a child's responses to abuse and satisfy the requirements of both Ind. R. Evid. 702(a) and Ind. R. Evid. 403.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed one of defendant's convictions for child molestation, reversed the other, and remanded the cause for a new trial on the reversed charge. Because research generally accepted as scientifically reliable recognized that child victims of sexual abuse could exhibit unexpected behavior patterns seemingly inconsistent with the claim of abuse, such evidence was permissible as specialized knowledge that would assist the trier of fact.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The legislature enacted Pub. L.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The taxpayer claimed that the refund sought represented tax either improperly levied upon or measured by municipal and federal bond income from municipal bonds or federal bonds. The taxpayer argued that the financial institution tax (FIT) was a direct tax on its federal and municipal bonds, as well as the income from those bonds, and that the application of the FIT was an impermissible retroactive tax. The department argued that the FIT did not tax the bond; rather, the FIT was an excise that taxes a financial institution's privilege of conducting business in Indiana. The court determined that based on the plain language of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 6-5.5-1-2 (1994) and its non-discriminatory formula for calculating the individual's tax liability, the FIT was not a direct tax but rather an excise tax on the exercise of the corporate privilege of operating as a financial institution in Indiana.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant brutalized an acquaintance and then set fire to her house, killing her and her children. The court held that the acquittal of one charge of murder and conviction on the others was not an inconsistent verdict because defendant's intent was independently proven for each crime. Defendant showed no prejudice from pre-trial publicity and the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion for judicial recusal. The trial court did err by failing to hold a hearing regarding the reliability of the DNA evidence, the qualification of the prosecution's expert witness, and the danger of unfair prejudice. However, the error was harmless because defendant failed to object. Because the DNA testimony involved precise measurements and testing, defendant was not entitled to a continuance or a court appointed expert to aid his defense. The trial court properly denied use of an alibi defense due to defendant's failure to timely notify the prosecution. The imposition of the death penalty was supported by the evidence and did not violate constitutional principles, however, the trial court failed to adequately provide its reasoning for the sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After defendant was convicted of murdering a police officer, he sought review. On appeal, defendant alleged that the jury panel was improperly drawn and that the system used to obtain prospective jurors violated Ind. Code &sect; 33-4-5-2(a), which required a list of prospective jurors be chosen from not only the list of legal voters in the county but also the latest tax schedules. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that many property owners were in fact registered voters and that there was no showing that the jury was made up entirely of registered voters only and excluded property owners. The court also held that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for change of venue because the jurors were questioned extensively concerning the knowledge they had gained of the case through news media or any other source. The court rejected defendant's argument that allowing the state to proceed to seek a death-qualified jury subjected him to a trial by a guilt-prone jury.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee, a waste facility operator, filed an action against appellants, environmental management department and commissioner, to challenge the constitutionality and retroactive application of Ind. Code &sect; 13-7-10.2 relating to a permit to modify the waste facility. The Marion Superior Court (Indiana) granted the operator a preliminary injunction and held the statute was unconstitutional. The department and commissioner filed a praecipe to appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The facility, the only commercial one in the state to treat and dispose of hazardous waste, sought a permit to modify the facility. The environmental management department (IDEM) took no action and, two years later, Ind. Code &sect; 13-7-10.2 (1990), which granted the commissioner broad powers to grant or deny permits, became law. IDEM stated that it intended to apply the statute in evaluating the application. IDEM argued the case was not ripe, the statute unconstitutionally distinguished between commercial and non-commercial waste disposal facilities, and it was entitled to a pre-deprivation hearing. The court held (1) the case was not ripe because it was unclear what rules would be promulgated and how to appeal therefrom; (2) in applying the rational basis test standard, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 23 was not violated because there was no burdening of the fundamental right to reputation or any suspect classification as denial of a permit was rationally related to the state interest in regulating commercial waste disposal facilities and did not involve reputation; and (3) due process was not violated because a post-deprivation hearing was adequate to protect the reputational interests.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant Indiana Gaming Commission (commission) sought review of an order from the Porter Superior Court (Indiana), which found that the statute, Ind.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The act created the commission, which was authorized to issue up to 11 riverboat casino licenses if the local legislative body approved of the practice through an ordinance, and the voters of the area voted for the gambling in a referendum, Ind. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 4-33-6-18 to 20. The voting schemes differentiated between cities and counties. The county of the residents voted against gambling. The trial court found that the act violated Ind. Const. art. IV, &sect; 23. On review, the court found that because riverboat gambling would only impact communities that bordered the water, the subject of the act was not amenable to a general law of uniform operation throughout the state. Because the referenda provided for in the act were intended as a means for the people, rather than the legislature, to determine for themselves whether to invite gambling operations into their communities, the court found that the ability to vote directly did not inherently convey a privilege or impose a burden and did not contravene &sect; 23. The court found that the voting rules from county to county were rationally related to the legitimate state interest in ensuring votes from those most affected by the act.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the finding that the act violated the state constitution and dissolved the injunction enjoining the commission from issuing licenses to riverboat gambling operations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of felony murder after a jury trial. His death sentence was reversed on appeal. On remand, the Marion County Superior Court (Indiana) assembled a new jury to hear evidence and make a recommendation as to the sentencing. After the jury became deadlocked, the trial court discharged the jury and proceeded to enter a judgment ordering the death penalty. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the trial court erred when it impaneled a new jury without any effort to determine if the original jury that had convicted him eleven years previously could be reassembled. The court affirmed the trial court's death penalty judgment. The court held that there was no error in assembling a new jury to make a recommendation to the trial court. The court stated that there was no practical purpose to be served by the trial judge ordering a search for the original jurors eleven years after their first decision in this case. The court noted that both the state and defendant were afforded the full opportunity to acquaint the new jury with the situation at hand. The fact that they were unable to reach a unanimous decision in no way indicated that they did not understand the facts of the situation. It merely meant they could not agree among themselves as to what recommendation to make to the trial judge. The court stated common sense and judicial economy dictated that the trial judge should have the latitude to assemble a new jury in a situation where substantial time had elapsed since defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court's rulings on defendant's objections, which he made during the penalty phase of his prosecution for felony murder, were affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted following a jury trial of six crimes committed during a two-day crime spree. The Boone Superior Court (Indiana) sentenced him to death for murder, and consecutive terms of twenty years for one count of robbery, twenty years for one count of confinement, three years for one count of auto theft, and three years for each of two counts of theft. Defendant appealed his convictions and sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised several arguments on appeal, which were regrouped and addressed as follows: 1) physical restraint at trial; 2) admissibility of defendant's statements; 3) loss or destruction of evidence; 4) evidence and instruction regarding escape; 5) merger of offenses; 6) constitutionality of Indiana's death penalty statute; 7) death penalty aggravator as double jeopardy; 8) penalty phase instructions; 9) failure to find and weigh mitigators; 10) use of nonstatutory aggravators including victim impact evidence; and 11) nature of relief to be afforded. Most of the arguments were without merit, but the court did make a new rule regarding the death penalty. The court held that when the death sentence was sought, the trial court had to limit the aggravating circumstances eligible for consideration to those specified in the death penalty statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court remanded to the trial court for revision of judgment, to merge the conviction for Count IV, charging theft of money and bank card, with that for Count I, charging robbery, and to vacate the separate sentence for Count IV accordingly. In all other respects, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court and the sentences, including the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murdering an elderly couple during an attempted burglary. He was also convicted of attempted murder of a third person. Defendant was sentenced to death. This was an appeal from a judgment denying post-conviction relief. He challenged his murder and attempted murder conviction and the death sentence. The court held that the trial court committed fundamental error in convicting defendant of attempted murder. The trial court erred when it failed to instruct the jury on all the essential elements of attempted murder. It reversed the decision of the post-conviction court denying post-conviction relief with respect to the attempted murder conviction and the resulting sentence, and remanded to the post-conviction court. However, the court affirmed the post-conviction court's decision denying defendant's post-conviction relief petition challenging his conviction and death sentences for the double murder.</SPAN></P>

L. No. 250-1993, &sect; 3, violated the equal protection clauses of both the Indiana and United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1991, defendant was charged with murder and the state sought the death penalty. In 1993, the death penalty statute was amended to provide for the alternative sentence of life imprisonment without parole; however, it only applied to murders committed after June 30, 1993. Subsequently, the trial court granted defendant's pretrial motion to instruct the jury of the sentencing alternative. The court reversed, finding that at the time of the offense alleged, the sentencing option was not available and defendant's crime must be governed by the law in effect when it was committed. It rejected defendant's contention that strict scrutiny must be applied as any interest defendant had in his life was curtailed by the procedures set out in the death penalty statute and then determined that the saving clause did not violate defendant's equal protection right as it was rationally related to the state's interest in determining under what circumstances the alternative sentence would be available. Further, there was no requirement that the appellate court compare the sentence of a case before it with the penalty imposed upon others convicted of the same crime or to be imposed in the future.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court determined that the death penalty statute did not violate the equal protection clauses of the state and federal constitutions and reversed the trial court's decision that allowed the jury to consider the alternative sentence of life without parole.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the department did have the express statutory authority to regulate and to control surface coal mining, including a surface coal mine operator's use of ground water. The court held that the department was acting within its statutory authority when ordering the permit applicants to revise its permits. The court recognized the restriction on the doctrine of absolute use of ground water. The department's actions were done pursuant to the enforcement of the Indiana Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, Ind. Code &sect; 13-4.1. The court also held that such controls were within the realm of the state's police power, which was generally exercised to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the general populace. Because this was a legitimate exercise of the police power, the court found that the department's action constituted a public use in compliance with public use component of the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted in a trial court (Indiana), of two counts of first-degree murder and of one count of felony murder. Defendant filed a motion for rehearing of the court's prior opinion which disposed of his appeal from the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bodies of the two victims, a husband and wife, were discovered. Defendant was arrested based upon information police received from his mother. Defendant was tried upon an indictment that charged three counts of first degree murder under the applicable homicide statute. The first count charged that defendant purposely and with premeditated malice killed the wife. The second count charged that defendant shot the husband while engaged in robbing him, thereby killing him. The third count charged that defendant purposely and with premeditated malice killed the husband. The jury returned separate verdicts of guilty on each of the three counts. In conformity with the then-existing law, the jury stated in each verdict that the punishment was life imprisonment. The trial court sentenced defendant to life imprisonment. On rehearing, the court agreed with defendant that the trial court's instructions employed an unconstitutional presumption aiding the prosecution with regard to the murder with malice counts and thereby denied defendant federal due process because a reasonable jury could have interpreted the instructions as requiring presumption of both purpose and malice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the motion for rehearing. The case was remanded to the trial court with instructions to vacate the two convictions for the purposeful and malicious killing of the victims and any sentence thereon. The conviction for the felony murder of the husband was affirmed, and the trial court was instructed to modify the judgment to reflect a single life sentence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of distributing a substance represented to be a controlled substance under Ind. Code &sect; 35-48-4-4.6 and was sentenced to six years in prison. The appellate court affirmed defendant's conviction on appeal, but remanded for resentencing. Defendant filed a petition for transfer. The court granted transfer and affirmed defendant's conviction. However, the court vacated defendant's sentence, holding that defendant's penalty was out of proportion to the nature of his offense. The court reasoned that defendant's sentence was twice as long as the maximum penalty that he would have faced had the planted material contained traces of marijuana. The court concluded that in light of the lesser penalties that attached to marijuana offenses, relative to other controlled substances, the application of &sect; 35-48-4-4.6 violated the constitutional requirement that all penalties be in proportion to the nature of the offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana certified the question of whether Ind. Code &sect; 34-2-28-1(a)(6) violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 22, by failing to impose any limitation upon the dollar value or amount of the property which could be exempted and/or by failing to contain any requirement that exempted property have a reasonable relation to the needs of a debtor for the support of himself and his family.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The bankruptcy petitioners contended that their individual retirement account was protected under Indiana's exemption law, which exempted an interest the judgment debtor had in a pension fund, a retirement fund, an annuity plan, an individual retirement account, or a similar fund, either private or public. The bankruptcy trustee objected to this claim of exemption and contended that Ind. Code &sect; 34-2-28-1(a)(6) violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 22. The court held that Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 22 commanded the legislature to enact exemptions, that &sect; 22 required statutes which defined the exemptions in reasonably tangible ways so as to balance the interests of lenders and debtors, and that statutes which created unlimited exemptions were inconsistent with the directive of &sect; 22 and the balanced policy underlying it. The court concluded that Ind. Code &sect; 34-2-28-1(a)(6) exempted an unlimited amount of intangible assets from execution to pay legitimate debts, making it possible to closet virtually every liquid asset possessed by a debtor simply through placing the assets in some form of retirement instrument.</SPAN></P>

The trial court had determined that retroactive restoration of the reservation of powers clause of the Indiana General Corporation Act (Act) years after it was ostensibly repealed was contrary to the Contracts Clause as applied to the instant parties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The reserved powers clause of the Act was ostensibly repealed in 1978. The corporation was formed in 1983, when the Act did not authorize reverse stock splits. In 1986 the clause was purportedly restored, and in 1987 the whole Act was superseded by the Business Corporation Law (BCL), which authorized reverse splits. The corporation then declared the split at issue under Ind. Code &sect; 23-1-38-2(4) and acquired the resulting fractional shares under &sect; 23-1-25-4(a)(1). The stockholders' ownership having thus been eliminated, they filed the instant action to have the split be declared ultra vires and void. The trial court granted the stockholders summary judgment, finding that the repeal of the clause was intentional and that the later attempt to restore the clause was ineffective. Therefore, the clause had not been in effect when the BCL was passed, and its authorization of reverse splits was ineffective as violative of the Contracts Clause, U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, as applied to the parties. The court reversed, holding that the repeal actually was a clerical error. The clause had thus been in effect the whole time, and the split under the BCL was valid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the stockholders and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in the stockholders' action to have the reverse stock split declared ultra vires and void.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded for acquittal appellant's conviction for disorderly conduct, holding that the statute was content-neutral on its face, provided fair notice, and was narrowly tailored to further a significant state interest but could not be applied to the content of appellant's expression. There was no persuasive precedent for application of federal overbreadth analysis to Indiana law. Appellant's screams were political speech, which was enshrined as a core value by Ind. Const. art I &sect; 9. The court concluded that political expression became unreasonably noisy for purposes of Ind. Code Ann. &sect; 35-45-1-3(2) when and only when it inflicted harm warranting tort liability against the speaker. The court found that any harm resulting from appellant's screams was a fleeting annoyance at most. Thus, there was insufficient evidence to establish that she violated the statute.</SPAN></P>

In reaching its decision, the court found that the prosecutor's expression of his personal opinion during closing argument was not improper because he was commenting on the credibility of the evidence and there was no implication that he had access to special information outside the evidence presented to the jury. The court further found that Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9 was not constitutionally infirm, appellant had no absolute right to individual voir dire, ample evidence supported the conspiracy to commit murder conviction, and the State had the right to present evidence to rebut appellant's expert medical testimony that he had no tendency to be sadistic and that there was no indication of profound psychological disturbance.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and remanded, holding that the exclusion of defendant's own alibi testimony under the alibi statute was an impermissible infringement upon the defendant's right to testify guaranteed by Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 13. Where the crucial issue to be resolved was one of credibility, and the defense consisted of the assertion that the victim was mistaken in her identification, depriving defendant of the opportunity to testify as to his whereabouts at the time of the crimes prejudiced defendant's substantial rights. The court further held that because the victim's identification was not inherently unreliable even though uncorroborated, a retrial was appropriate. The court held that evidence of a subsequent burglary at the same address after defendant was arrested should be admitted and that it was not error to admit evidence of defendant's threats against the victim.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that there was sufficient evidence to find that although mentally ill, defendant had sufficient comprehension to understand the charges and to be able to stand trial. The court found no error in the overruling of defendant's plea in abatement on the ground that one of the grand jurors was related to the prosecutor because the grand jury was not an ultimate trier of fact, thus the lack of impartiality by a grand juror did not violate the constitutional right to a fair trial by an impartial jury. The court determined that photographs of the victims' bodies were relevant and were admissible at the trial court's discretion.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction in the Marion County Superior Court Criminal Division (Indiana) of two counts of murder, conspiracy, robbery, and nine counts of criminal confinement; and from his sentence of 60 years each on the murder counts to be served concurrently, and 30 years on the robbery count and 10 years for each criminal confinement, all to be served consecutively to the murder sentences.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant claimed that the state improperly charged him as a principal when its theory was accomplice liability, that the information lacked the specificity required for notice of that accusation, and that the trial court abused its discretion in its written order by sentencing him to consecutive sentences after finding that no aggravating or mitigating circumstances existed with respect to the conspiracy or confinement counts. The trial court held that defendant could be charged as a principal even if the evidence only established that he was an accomplice, and detailed the existence of aggravating circumstances. The court affirmed, finding that defendant was criminally liable for the acts of his confederate and could be held responsible as a principal. Nowhere in the transcript of the hearing did the trial court state that there were no aggravators or mitigators present in reference to the conspiracy or confinement charges. The misstatement was present in the written sentencing order. It was logical that the transcript created by use of notes taken during the proceeding was more accurate. The trial court's proper statement regarding sentencing was located in the transcript.</SPAN></P>

The court vacated the court of appeals decisions on both parties' motions for summary judgment. The court remanded the cause for reconsideration according to the opinion. The court of appeals correctly declined to abolish the doctrine of necessaries and reformulated it in a gender-neutral manner. The court of appeals correctly held that each spouse should be primarily liable on the agreements that either of them made individually, if for necessaries. The court of appeals incorrectly ruled based on precedent by utilizing that precedent with an improper approach. The court of appeals decision disregarded the social, economic, and legal factors that made one spouse financially dependent. The court determined that the doctrine was not to impose a mutual obligation and its purpose was to protect dependent spouses to ensure their survival. The court determined that the doctrine incorrectly imposed secondary liability for financial debts on the dependent spouse.</SPAN></P>

The proven existence and availability of proof presented at the post-conviction hearing, which included evidence of defendant's extreme disadvantage and his worthy habits and accomplishments, commanded the conclusion that defense counsel's performance in preparing for and conducting defendant's case at sentencing was deficient, and that the probability that his client would have received a lesser sentence, but for this deficiency was sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.</SPAN></P>

The aggravating circumstances were intentional murder during the commission of a robbery and a conviction in Texas for murdering a police officer. Defendant appealed, and the court affirmed. The court held that evidence of the other crime was properly admitted because it was a signature crime that was highly probative of the killer's identity. The court held that it was proper for a pathologist to give an opinion based on the reports of two other doctors. The court found that it was erroneous for the trial judge to have read to the jury on several occasions the list of aggravating circumstances for the death penalty. However, the court held that it was harmless error which did not violate defendant's due process rights. The court held that it was proper to use a non-final Texas murder conviction as an aggravating circumstance because Indiana law and not Texas law determined what qualified as an aggravating circumstance under Ind.

Affirming, the court found that both medical experts testified that defendant had the ability to differentiate between right and wrong even though he was suffering from mental disability. Thus, there was ample evidence from which the jury could conclude that although defendant suffered from mental illness, he in fact knew right from wrong and had the capacity to consciously plan to kill the victim. Moreover, Ind. Code &sect; 35-41-4-1(b) did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to defendant on the issue of insanity. The court noted that insanity was an affirmative defense for which defendant had the burden of proof. Finally, there was no error in the trial court's ruling on the burden of proof concerning defendant's insanity defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of the murders of his pregnant wife and his parents after a jury trial. Defendant strangled his wife to death as she lay on her bed, and he stabbed both his mother and father to death with a knife. The jury imposed the death penalty for the murders of defendant's parents, but recommended that the death sentence not be imposed for the murder of defendant's wife. Defendant was also convicted of feticide for causing the death of his wife's six-month old fetus, which died when defendant killed its mother. Defendant raised numerous challenges on appeal, including that the trial court misinstructed the jury on defendant's tendered insanity defense. Defendant alleged that the prosecution failed to prove that he acted voluntarily, contending that the elimination of the concept of &quot;irresistible impulse&quot; from the Indiana insanity statute was unconstitutional. The appellate court rejected defendant's contention, finding that the state proved that defendant was acting voluntarily beyond a reasonable doubt when he committed the three murders. The appellate court also rejected defendant's alleged errors concerning voir dire, and the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The state argued that the Tort Claims Act, Ind. Code Ann &sect; 34-4-16.5-3(7) (1992), did not violate Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12. The court agreed and reversed the trial court's entry of partial summary judgment. The court stated that in cases involving injury to person or property, Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 did not prevent the legislature from modifying or restricting common law rights and remedies by granting sovereign immunity for such claims. In tort cases, the source of authority or lack thereof to sue the state originally arose from rights at common law, not from rights contained in the Constitution. Thus, it was within the legislature's authority to expand or restrict the scope of sovereign immunity through the Tort Claims Act. Finally, that the application of sovereign immunity would result in the victim bearing the full economic burden of his injuries and damages without the ability to insure himself against such losses. The court found that it was a matter of policy for the legislature, not for the court to address.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed his conviction and sentence from the Morgan Circuit Court (Indiana), which, after a jury found defendant guilty of murder and recommended the death penalty, sentenced defendant to death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After a jury trial, defendant was convicted of murder for the stabbing and strangulation death of a woman. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation of the death penalty. The court affirmed defendant's conviction, holding that the voir dire record supported the trial court's denial of defendant's motion for change of venue. The trial court did not err by admitting photographs of the victim to show the nature of her injuries and there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction. The penalty phase did not run afoul of the Due Process Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Defendant did not show that he received ineffective assistance of counsel where only one attorney represented him. The court reversed the sentence of death, holding that the trial court improperly considered defendant's tattoo of a knife with dripping blood, which defendant obtained after the trial, and its implied callousness, audacity, and lack of remorse as an aggravating factor under Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9(b) (1991).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendants claimed that they were entitled to separate trials where each accused the other of the victims' murders. The court affirmed the felony murder convictions and death sentences. Defendants waived the right to separate trials where they failed to show their antagonistic defenses before the trial and they failed to raise the issue at the close of the evidence. There was no abuse of discretion in allowing one defendant a rebuttal in closing arguments to counter the other defendant's claim that the first defendant committed the murders where defendants had equal time. The death penalty statute was not unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The state was allowed to raise defendant's participation in an attempted robbery in the penalty phase, though he was not charged with that crime, to disprove the mitigating circumstance that he had not participated in any other significant crimes. The aggravating circumstances to justify the death penalty were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, though one defendant was 18 years old. Though only one defendant committed the murders, the other's conviction and sentence was justified where he acted with reckless indifference to human life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant city challenged the Court of Appeals (Indiana), which affirmed the trial court's judgment that was entered in favor of appellee remonstrators, landowners from an annexed area, and that found an annexation ordinance invalid in the remonstrators' complaint against the city's annexation ordinances, which were adopted for the annexation of certain adjacent and contiguous portions of a township.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The trial court found for the city on some points but sustained the remonstrance because the city's fiscal plan did not set out which of its areas were similar in topography, patterns of land use, and population density to the annexed area. While there was evidence offered during trial about these comparisons, the trial court felt obliged to decide without such evidence. The lower court affirmed. On appeal, the court held that the effect of filing a remonstrance was to abate the culmination of annexation pending review in the courts, as the burden was on the municipality to sustain annexation by showing that it complied with statutory requirements. Because the city's authority to annex territory was limited by statute, the court's duty was to find whether the city exceeded its authority and met conditions imposed by statute. As to requirements that the city spell out what services it planned to provide to the annexed area, the city was not required to set out in the plan itself comparisons between the city and the annexed territory. A fiscal plan as to annexation needed to be in writing to protect the landowners' right to force the annexing city to provide the services promised.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed those portions of the trial court's findings on much of the remonstrance that were unchallenged on appeal.

Admin. Code tit. 905, r. 1-28-1(3) (rule 28), which placed certain restrictions on the sales of the brewers' products.</SPAN></P>

The brewers claimed that the rule was an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers required by Ind. Const. art. 3, &sect; 1. The trial court ruled that the commission did not exceed its authority when it promulgated Rule 28.

The court vacated the decision and ruled that applying principles of administrative law to statutes governing alcoholic beverages resulted in a determination that the legislature's grant of power to the commission was sufficiently comprehensive to grant the commission authority to promulgate and enforce Rule 28 as to distillers, brewers, rectifiers, and vintners and that the rule passed both constitutional and statutory muster.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed the trial court erred when it failed to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter. The court held that there was no evidence to support such an instruction. There was no evidence that defendant's disagreement with his girlfriend resulted in anything but an exchange of words. The court held that words alone were not sufficient provocation to reduce murder to manslaughter. There was also no evidence of heat of passion. Therefore, the trial court did not err. Defendant claimed that the trial court erred when it failed to properly credit existing mitigating factors that he was a good father and had no significant criminal record. The court held that the mitigating factors did not gainsay the circumstances of defendant's action in perpetrating the crimes. The court held that the trial court thoroughly examined and balanced both the mitigators and aggravators and fully justified the pronounced sentence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from the judgment of the Vanderburgh Circuit Court (Indiana) that, following the jury trial, convicted him of dealing in cocaine within 1,000 feet of school property and dealing in a narcotic drug. He received an enhanced sentenced due to his status as a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant, who was black, appealed from his conviction on drug-related charges. He asserted that the circuit court violated the Equal Protection Clause when it failed to require the prosecution to give racially neutral reasons for its peremptory strike of the only prospective juror who also was black. The court noted that prosecutors were prohibited from challenging potential veniremen solely on the basis of their race. The court held that although defendant showed that he was of the same race as the peremptorily challenged potential venireman, he did not offer any other evidence indicating the prosecutor's purposeful exclusion of the venireman on the basis of race. Therefore, the court concluded, defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination, and the burden did not shift to the prosecutor to provide a neutral explanation of the reasons for its use of the peremptory challenge. The presumption that the prosecution used its challenge to obtain a fair and impartial jury remained intact. The court also rejected defendant's other claims regarding the chain of custody and the sufficiency of evidence. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Respondent state appealed the decision from the Court of Appeals (Indiana), which remanded the decision from the trial court granting petitioner former criminal defendant's request for post-conviction relief and denying the state's motion to dismiss. The state argued that Ind. R. Crim. P. 5 and Ind. R. Crim. P. 10 created a 10-year statute of limitations to filing post-conviction petitions challenging misdemeanor guilty pleas.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The former criminal defendant pled guilty to carrying a handgun without a license. The former criminal defendant did not present any record of the guilty plea in his petition. The trial court granted the petition based on the former criminal defendant's testimony. The lower appellate court held that a petition for post-conviction relief could be filed at any time, but it remanded for findings of fact, which were never entered by the trial court. The state supreme court vacated the trial court and remanded. The criminal rules did not create a statute of limitations. While Ind. R. Crim. P. 10 stated that misdemeanor court records had to be kept for 10 years, the loss of a record after that time did not require the denial of relief since the availability of the original record was only one factor to consider in granting relief. Neither that rule nor Ind. R. Crim. P. 5 created and implied limitations period. Whether relief should have been granted could not be resolved since the former criminal defendant did not adequately show that his record was unavailable or that it could not have been reconstructed and since findings of fact were not entered.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied his request for bail. Thereafter, the lower court denied his petition for bail pending appeal. On appeal, the court provided the courts of Indiana with guidance on the legal criteria governing petitions for bond pending appeal. The court found that a defendant had the burden of demonstrating that there were compelling reasons to allow a guilty defendant to remain free pending appeal of his conviction. In hearing such petitions, the appellate court was required to examine three factors: (1) the probability of reversible error at trial, (2) the risk of flight, and (3) the potential dangerousness of the defendant. The appellate court had to give the trial court appropriate deference, however, on those issues which the trial court was in the best position to judge. A defendant had to show that there was a likelihood that his conviction would be reversed on appeal.</SPAN></P>

The property was sold at tax sale and two years later, the auditor mailed a notice of redemption to the property owner. Soon afterwards, the purchaser received a tax deed to the property that was recorded seven days later. Eighteen months later, the trial court entered summary judgment in favor of two mortgagees, invalidating the tax sale on the grounds that failure to notify the mortgagees of the tax sale was an unconstitutional deprivation of their due process rights. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the tax sale and tax deed were valid because the mortgagees, or any other interested party, could have received notice under &sect; 6-1.1-24-4.2 and such a scheme satisfied the requirements of constitutional due process.</SPAN></P>

Two months after the tax certificates were issued, amendments to the statute became effective, which reduced the redemption period to one year.

Defendant pursued the ex-wife when she ran from the house and beat her with the shotgun until it broke into pieces. The ex-wife's autopsy revealed that she died as a result of trauma to the head from a blunt instrument. On appeal, defendant claimed that the trial court erred in refusing his tendered instruction on voluntary manslaughter, that he should have been allowed to call the prosecuting attorney as a witness regarding his insanity defense, and that he should have been able to introduce at trial the prosecutor's testimony from the pretrial hearing. Defendant also argued, inter alia, that application of the death penalty statute to his case was inappropriate and unconstitutional. The court rejected defendant's contentions and affirmed the trial court's judgment convicting him of burglary and murder and sentencing him to death.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In 1987, a criminal defendant charged with battery and attempted murder deposited $ 100,000 cash in lieu of bail and was released. Defendant never appeared for trial and his &quot;bond&quot; was revoked. Shortly thereafter, the victim filed a civil action against defendant. He failed to appear for that trial, and the victim was awarded damages. The victim attempted to execute the judgment by garnishing the revoked cash bond. The trial court ordered the bond released to the victim. The state treasurer sought review. In 1990, the court reversed the judgment and ordered the bond forfeited to the state. The victim filed a petition for a rehearing, during the pendency of which a statute was enacted that required the payment of a criminal defendant's deposit to the victim in the event the victim won a judgment against the defendant. The court denied the petition. The victim filed a motion in the criminal court to recover the cash deposit, which was granted. The treasurer sought review and the court affirmed. The court found that the victim's award did not constitute a retroactive use of the statute because the victim's motion for the funds was not filed until after the statute's effective date.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant appealed from his conviction by the Tippecanoe Superior Court (Indiana) for dealing in cocaine and for conspiracy and also challenged the total 110-year sentence that was imposed. Defendant argued that his constitutional rights were violated, that drug evidence was improperly admitted, that the evidence was insufficient to support the habitual offender determination, and that his sentence was incorrectly enhanced and excessive.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The evidence against defendant included testimony from drug offenders who cooperated in exchange for leniency. The court held that: (1) counsel's failure to call witnesses whose testimony had little value and to object on all possible grounds to damaging evidence was not ineffective assistance; (2) a non-custodial recording of a conversation between defendant and an informant witness was probative to show that defendant was the witness's dealer; (3) the absence of an evidence technician's name and testimony did not create a gap in the chain of custody relating to drug evidence; (4) the scope of cross-examination was not improperly limited, as the information defendant sought to elicit was not relevant to show bias; (5) the comment on defendant's post-arrest silence was harmless, as it was not used to prove guilt and was stricken; (6) it was irrelevant that the crime used to support the habitual offender determination was no longer considered a felony or that only a one-year sentence was imposed for its commission; (7) the sentence was not excessive in view of the current and prior offenses; and (8) the enhanced sentence was supported by specific aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The judgment that convicted defendant of two counts of dealing in cocaine and two related conspiracy counts was affirmed. The 110-year enhanced sentence imposed upon defendant was also affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted by a jury and sentenced to imprisonment. An assistant band director at a high school went to the school for a meeting on a Sunday morning. When he arrived, he noticed light coming from an open classroom door. He stopped to say hello and saw defendant sitting on a table. Defendant produced a pistol and fired at the teacher but the gun misfired. The teacher ran away, and defendant chased him, shot him in the chin, and hit him with a claw hammer on the back of his head. It was discovered that several rooms in the school had been ransacked. The teacher identified defendant as the perpetrator, and his fingerprints were found on a safe in the school building. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in granting the State's motion to waive him from juvenile court to stand trial as an adult. He argued that he was denied due process of law because the trial court's order that waived jurisdiction was not sufficiently specific to comply with the provisions of Ind. Code &sect; 31-6-2-4(e). The court affirmed the trial court and held that the juvenile court's decision to waive jurisdiction was reviewed for an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellant property owners filed actions against appellee developers alleging that the developers' group homes for disabled persons violated certain restrictive covenants. The trial court granted the developers' motion for summary judgment, holding that Ind. Code &sect; 16-13-21-14(a) (1988) prohibited enforcement of such restricted covenants. The Court of Appeals (Indiana) reversed the trial court's order, and the developers petitioned for transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The primary issue before the court was whether retroactive application of &sect; 16-13-21-14(a) violated the contract clause in Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 24. The court ruled that the retroactive application of a statute to a contract entered into before the effective date of the statute could have withstood scrutiny under the contract clause only if it was necessary for the general public and reasonable under the circumstances. Applying that standard, the court held that the legislative justification for &sect; 16-13-21-14(a) did not fall within the necessary police power exception to the contract clause because it was not reasonably necessary for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the general public, and did not address a broad problem general to society. Moreover, the statute's effect was permanent, irrevocable, and retroactive in altering the contractual relationships created in restriction covenants, and it imposed statutory regulation in a field not traditionally subject to legislation. The court held that in seeking to alter the enforceability of restrictive covenants, the statute represented a considerable impairment of contractual obligations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted the developers' petition for transfer, and reversed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the developers.

The court rejected defendant's five arguments that the Indiana death penalty statute was unconstitutional.

The court determined that defendant's confession and its corroboration clearly showed sufficient evidence to support convictions for each of the three murders charged.

One month later, he filed a third notice, which mentioned the same witness as the first notice. At trial, the State introduced the notices as rebuttal evidence attacking the credibility of defendant's alibi witness. A jury found him guilty of rape and confinement. The trial court entered a judgment to that effect. On appeal, that judgment was affirmed. The court stated that the alibi notices could be used to attack the alibi witness's credibility. Moreover, their admission did not interfere with defendant's self-incrimination privilege and did not impermissibly call attention to that fact that he had not testified.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee juvenile wards brought suit against appellant state seeking injunctive relief, declaratory relief, and class certification. The Marion Superior Court, Juvenile Division, certified appellees as a class and determined that Ind. Code Ann. &sect;31-6-14-1 violated the Indiana Constitution and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. State appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">State argued that since juvenile wards were no longer under the age of 18, the appeal was moot. The court determined that although the state could not have enforced the provisions of Ind. Code. Ann. &sect; 31-6-14-1 against the named class members, the statute would certainly be enforced against members of the class that they sought to represent. Therefore, the case was not moot. Juvenile wards argued that the challenged statute violated the separation of powers clause of the Indiana Constitution. The court found that the presence of one member of the executive branch of government on a multi-member committee that served an advisory role to the judicial branch, did not violate the separation of powers doctrine. The court concluded that the statute did not impose an unconstitutional delay in contravention of the speedy trial clause of the Indiana Constitution. Furthermore, the court held that a stay in an interim house pending the determination of the best permanent placement of juvenile wards did not compromise the child's constitutional right to due process.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was implicated in a robbery, as well as the kidnapping and murder of a woman. Defendant's girlfriend gave the police permission to search her gym bag, which was being used by defendant. Defendant was convicted, but the jury recommended that the death penalty not be imposed. The trial judge determined that the death penalty was appropriate and defendant sought review. The court affirmed the convictions, but reversed and remanded the case for re-sentencing. The trial judge did not use the proper standard in overriding the jury's recommendation and sentencing defendant to death. The search was not invalid because the police had a reasonable belief that defendant's girlfriend had the authority to consent to a search of the bag. Forensic evidence was admissible where the state established a &quot;reasonable assurance&quot; that the evidence passed through various hands in an undisturbed condition. The state was not required to establish a perfect chain of custody. Defendant was not denied a meaningful access to justice by the trial court's denial of his motion to retain an expert.

However, the court held that the policy reasons established for the exclusionary rule did not apply. The court held that one of the well-recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement was an entry under emergency circumstances involving injury or imminent danger to a person's life for the purpose of preventing further injury or aiding those injured. The court held that the danger to the victim certainly outweighed the defendant's reasonable expectations to privacy.

Code &sect; 35-37-4-8, which authorized the use of videotaped testimony of child witnesses at trial, was unconstitutional. The court agreed and reversed defendant's conviction. The court held that that statute was constitutional under the federal constitution. The statute satisfied the requirements of the federal confrontation right. However, the court held that the statute was not constitutional under the Indiana constitution. Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 13 provided that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused had the right to have met the witnesses face to face. The court determined that Indiana's confrontation right therefore contained both the right of cross-examination and the right to have met the witnesses face to face. Therefore, the statute infringed upon defendant's right to confront the witness against him face to face and the videotaped testimony was erroneously admitted into evidence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Appellee taxpayers brought actions against appellant Indiana Department of State Revenue (department) challenging the constitutionality of Indiana's intangibles tax, asserting the tax violated U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 8, cl. 3 and the uniform taxation provisions of Ind. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1. The department sought review of the order of the Marion Circuit Court (Indiana), which held the tax unconstitutional under federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a consolidated case, the court certified the class, but denied a motion for an escrow account to hold taxes collected. Subsequently, the legislature repealed the intangibles tax retroactively. The court found that the recently-repealed intangibles tax did not violate the Commerce Clause under the substantial equivalent test, because it required all property, foreign or domestic, to contribute a pro rata share of taxes so far as practicable to avoid double taxation. The legislature could discriminate within the intangible personal property tax class consistently with the uniformity requirement of Ind. Const. art. 10, &sect; 1. Although Commerce Clause violations were cognizable under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, defendants were granted summary judgment on the &sect; 1983 claim because states and state officials acting in their official capacities are not persons under &sect; 1983.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">After studying a pending U.S. Supreme Court case and the Indiana death penalty statute, defendant's original trial counsel advised him to accept the prosecution's plea agreement if he wished to avoid the death penalty. Defendant pled guilty to murder in the perpetration of a robbery. Some 10 years later, defendant filed a post-conviction relief petition. The trial court granted the prosecution a continuance to pursuit the defense of laches. Thereafter, defendant's petition was denied. The court noted that trial counsel had no way of predicting the outcome of pending cases. The court would not speculate as to what might have been the most advantageous strategy. Defendant failed to show ineffective representation by trial counsel. Further, the court found no error in permitting the prosecution to present laches. Moreover, the trial court was justified in finding that given the passage of time, the absence of certain witnesses, and the possibility of a known codefendant recanting his prior statement, the prosecution was in a poor position to reprosecute defendant. Finally, the record did not disclose actual bias and prejudice of the post-conviction judge against defendant.</SPAN></P>

Defendant then called the police and was arrested. The trial court convicted him of confinement, rape, murder, and felony murder, and sentenced him to death. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the trial judge considered the evidence proffered in mitigation by defendant. Defendant's claim that a separate jury should have been impaneled for each stage of a death penalty case was contrary to Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9. The court found that sufficient evidence supported the trial court's decision to deny defendant's motion to suppress statements made by him. The trial court had broad discretion in controlling voir dire, and there was no showing that the trial court abused such discretion. The court determined that there was no error in permitting court-appointed psychiatrists to testify regarding previous examinations of defendant. In addition, there was no error in allowing the state to introduce five photographs of the dead victim, which were used by the pathologist in explaining his testimony.

Defendant was sentenced to enhanced terms of 8 years for the Class C felony count and 4 years for each of the 10 Class D felony counts, all terms to be served consecutively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant contended that the trial court erred in denying his motions to dismiss the corrupt business influence and unlawful loan brokering counts, that his sentence totaling 48 years, representing the maximum possible term for his convictions, was unjustifiably severe, and that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. The court held that the Indiana Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code &sect; 35-45-6-1 et seq., was neither impermissibly vague nor overbroad. The trial court properly denied defendant's motions to dismiss the counts of corrupt business influence and unlawful loan brokering. The court determined that the trial court did not err in imposing defendant's sentence because the history and scope of defendant's criminal activities revealed little chance for rehabilitation such that the maximum sentence was called for in order to prevent recurrence of his activities. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to prove the &quot;unauthorized control&quot; element of theft under Ind. Code &sect; 35-43-4-1(b)(4), (6) and, thus, to support the theft and corrupt business influence convictions. Hence, the court affirmed the judgment of conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiffs, a class of citizens, filed an action against defendants, city, officials, and state police superintendent, for violations of 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the Indiana Firearms Act, codified at Ind. Code &sect; 35-47-2-3, by denying citizens handgun application forms. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the citizens. The Third District Court of Appeals (Indiana) reversed. The citizens petitioned to transfer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The appellate court found the failure of the citizens to wait until their claim had been denied before bringing suit against the city violated &sect; 12 of the Indiana Tort Claims Act, codified at Ind. Code &sect; 34-4-16.5-12. The court held that states could not apply such an outcome-determinative law when entertaining substantive federal rights. The citizens had a cause of action for damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 and the city and its officials were not immune from suit. The evidence demonstrated arbitrary and wrongful government action and an abuse of power. City officials exceeded their authority when they suspended the handgun license application process by mayoral decree with no pre-deprivation hearing. The citizens were deprived of a federally protected, state created, substantive right to carry a handgun with a license when the application process was terminated. After trial, the city's policy was to distribute the handgun license applications, but to systematically recommend them for denial. That delay did not constitute a deprivation of a liberty or property interest without due process, but was an aggravating circumstance sufficient to warrant punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court granted transfer, vacated the order of the appellate court, and remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. The court held that the trial court erred when it certified the class, and the court reversed and modified the compensatory and punitive damages awarded to the class of citizens. The court affirmed the award of attorney's fees to the citizens, with modifications.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The Indiana legislature enacted the Attorney Trust Account Act, Pub. L.

Upon consideration of the issue of the legislation's constitutionality, the court held that the provision that provided immunity from disciplinary proceedings contravened Ind. Const. art.

VII, &sect; 4 to regulate professional legal activity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged his convictions for driving while suspended, operating while intoxicated, and operating with a .10 percent blood alcohol level from the Hamilton County Court (Indiana), which ordered defendant's elevated and enhanced sentences to run consecutively due to multiple violations and for being a habitual offender.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant asserted that his convictions must be reversed because he was denied effective assistance of counsel and because his felony conviction and habitual offender sentence were constitutionally infirm as the jury instructions were incomplete. Also, defendant maintained that his habitual offender sentence should be vacated because the information upon which the State proceeded was defective. Next, he argued that his sentence of 35 years for operating while intoxicated and driving while suspended was excessive and disproportionate, and thus his sentence must be revised. The court partially agreed, remanding the case to the lower court to modify the judgment to reflect sentences of one year and four years for the two convictions, the sentences to run consecutively for a total of five years. The court reversed the trial court's decision to further enhance defendant's sentence. Defendant's sentence of two years for operating while intoxicated, plus an additional two years for aggravating circumstances, was the maximum sentence allowed. The penalty imposed, 35 years, was not proportionate to his offense and therefore violated Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 16.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed defendant's convictions and corresponding sentences for driving while suspended, a one-year sentence, and operating while intoxicated, a two-year sentence, plus an additional two years for aggravating circumstances ordered to run consecutive to the driving while suspended sentence. The court remanded the case to the lower court to modify the judgment to reflect the new sentence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Subsequent to his conviction, defendant appealed and the court affirmed. Defendant alleged that the state presented evidence of the impact of his crimes on the victims and testimony by a family member concerning the propriety of the death penalty. The grandmother testified that her daughter had become withdrawn as a result of watching her niece killed and being sexually assaulted herself. The court found that those were hardly factors about which the defendant was unaware. The grandmother's statement about her own attempt at suicide and her opinion as to defendant's sentencing were not relied on by the trial court in sentencing and the testimony did not violate the eighth amendment. The court affirmed the conclusion that a prosecutor's note only minimally affected defendant's ability to decide whether to testify and found that the victim's pre-trial identification was not the product of improperly suggestive procedures. The court found that as defendant was convicted of murders in another state, he enticed two young girls, bound them, stomped and strangled one of them to death, and repeatedly molested the other, and there were no mitigating factors, the death penalty was justified.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed the death sentence and otherwise affirmed his denial of post-conviction relief. The court ruled that the jury was not misled, but was simply informed that the responsibility for sentencing ultimately rested with the judge. The court found that defense counsel was ineffective at the guilt phase when he made reprehensible comments, which were likely to have lingered in the jurors' minds and prejudiced their decision concerning the death penalty. Defense counsel was also ineffective when he failed to present and investigate mitigating evidence. The court held that defense counsel's comments at the guilt phase entitled defendant to relief under the Strickland test. The court concluded that defendant's representation fell below the reasonable standards and the failure to investigate mitigation fell below prevailing norms in the profession. Substantial mitigation was available and would have helped create a more sympathetic portrait of defendant. The cumulative effect of counsel's acts and omissions rendered the result of the penalty phase unreliable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant and an accomplice burglarized a home and, during the course thereof, killed the homeowners.

Defendant initially received the death penalty for the two murders, but the court set the death sentence aside in a previous appeal and remanded the case for resentencing. In imposing the two 60-year enhanced sentences, the trial court stated as aggravating factors that the victims were aged, were virtually unknown to defendant, and were murdered in an unnecessary and brutal manner. The court held that: (1) sentencing was within the discretion of the trial court, and a sentence that was authorized by statute would not be revised on appeal unless it was manifestly unreasonable; (2) the fact that defendant's accomplice received a lesser sentence for the same crime was not sufficient in and of itself to invalidate defendant's sentence; (3) it was not unconstitutionally disproportionate to sentence a &quot;trigger man&quot; to a greater sentence than that of his accomplice; and (4) there was nothing in the record to indicate that the trial court exceeded its statutory authority.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">In a direct appeal, pursuant to Ind. R. App. P. 4(A)(8), the State argued that the trial court erred when it concluded that the statute and its implementing regulations were unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment, which had granted defendant's motion to dismiss the charge. Specifically, the court rejected defendant's contention that Ind. Admin. Code tit. 325, r. 13-1.1, as incorporated in Ind. Code &sect; 13-1-1-9, violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Indiana Constitution or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Instead, the court held that, after treating the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment, neither the trial court findings nor defendant's motion directed the court's attention to any evidence showing that defendant was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law upon the grounds that the regulations and statute were unconstitutionally applied. Rather, the court noted that there was no evidence that officials administered the program, declared by the trial court to have been constitutional on its face, in a discriminatory manner against a protected class.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">On review of the dismissal of the petition, the court ordered summary affirmance.

The court also found that the commission did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the petition on the merits rather than for lack of prosecution. The court determined that it was not error to conclude that a rate increase was not available because allowing a cooperatively-owned utility to generate funds to repay debts incurred in pursuit of a failed nuclear power plant by way of a rate increase produced the intolerable result of subjecting its &quot;stockholders&quot; to unlimited liability for investment decisions into which they had no input and from which they had no recourse in the marketplace.

The trial court denied the petition. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that appellant was not denied his right to a fair trial when the trial court submitted certain instructions to the jury because the trial court gave thorough instructions regarding the burden of proof on all material issues. The court found that the trial court did not err in imposing consecutive sentences because petitioner committed several crimes while in the process of committing another crime. The court held that certain matters handled in petitioner's direct appeal were res judicata and not subject to consideration for post-conviction relief. The court found that petitioner was not denied effective assistance of counsel because he did not show that his counsel's performance was so deficient as to prejudice him and deprive him of a fair trial. The court held that the trial court's finding that petitioner was guilty of laches in bringing his post-conviction relief petition was appropriate because petitioner was aware of available remedies and his delay was unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

He argued that the trial court erred in finding that he was not denied effective assistance of counsel.

The court reversed the trial court's decision, holding that defense counsel's representation fell below the prevailing norm for reasonably competent counsel and that his failure to function undermined confidence in the guilty verdict as well as the sentencing.

The court answered the question in the affirmative and held that plaintiffs were allowed to bring the suit more than 10 years after the last exposure to the asbestos. Because the was a case of disease, plaintiff tort victim's cause of action accrued on the date he discovered or should have discovered the alleged injury and that the injury was caused by the asbestos manufactured by defendant tort feasors. Accordingly, plaintiffs' action was timely, as the action was brought within the two years after discovery and thereby within the statute of limitations contained in Ind. Code &sect; 33-1-1.5-5. The court held that to have limited the period in which, even with due diligence, plaintiffs could have discovered that the cause of action existed, would have been inconsistent with the system of jurisprudence.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed his convictions and the imposition of the death penalty. The court remanded the action with instructions to vacate defendant's convictions for robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery because robbery was a lesser included offense that merged into the conviction for felony murder. The charge for conspiracy to commit robbery was vacated because it involved the same acts as the conspiracy to commit robbery and it was improper to impose multiple punishments for a single offense. The remaining convictions and the death sentence, however, were affirmed. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for separate trials, in allowing into evidence defendant's statement, in denying the motion for a change of venue, in allowing photographs of the victim's corpse, and in refusing to give an instruction on a lesser included offense.

The archaeological society petitioned the DNR to have the land designated unsuitable for coal mining under Ind. Code &sect; 13-4.1-14-2. The director's final order designated the land unsuitable for surface coal mining. The director included in the order a mitigation plan, which provided a way for the &quot;unsuitable&quot; designation to be removed through site testing and data recovery conducted by a DNR-approved archaeological contractor. The court vacated the lower court's decision. The court found that because the mitigation plan provided a means for the land to be designated suitable, a taking did not occur. It also found that the mitigation plan did not require the landowner to expend any money or convey property or property rights to the state. The plan also did not prevent the landowner from continuing to extract coal by means other than strip mining. Only two percent of the landowner's land would have been affected, assuming alternative mining methods were not used. The landowner's investment-backed expectations and present land use, therefore, were not significantly affected. Protection of cultural resources was a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was convicted of murder, burglary, and attempted criminal deviate conduct, was determined to be an habitual offender, and was sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) Ind. Code &sect; 35-50-2-9, which provided for the jury to make a recommendation to the sentencing judge regarding imposition of the death penalty, leaving to the trial judge the option to follow or not follow the recommendation, did not violate defendant's due process rights; (2) defendant's double jeopardy rights were not violated; (3) the trial court did not err in its admission of evidence, refusal and allowance of instructions, exclusion of testimony, and denial of a mistrial; and (4) the convictions were supported by sufficient evidence. The court further held that the record supported the trial judge's conclusion that defendant murdered the victim, burglarized her apartment, and attempted acts of criminal sexual deviancy. The record also showed defendant to be an habitual offender. The court therefore found that the death penalty as provided for under Indiana statutes was not arbitrarily or capriciously imposed upon defendant and was reasonable and appropriate in his case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that her death sentence violated the Indiana Constitution and the United States Constitution because she was 15 years old when she committed the crime. The court agreed and reversed the judgment of the trial court. The court observed that Indiana's death penalty statute was revised, as the result of this case, to specify that the death penalty could not be imposed upon a defendant below the age of 16. The court found that defendant would be both the first and last person ever to be executed in Indiana for a crime committed at the age of 15. Accordingly, the court determined that defendant's sentence failed to comply with the Indiana Constitution in that it was unique and disproportionate to any other sentence for the same crime. The court also determined that the Indiana death penalty statute, at the time defendant committed her crime, did not specify a minimum age and, therefore, failed to comply with the requirements of the Eighth Amendment. The court concluded that entry of a final judgment, rather than a remand to the trial court, was appropriate and imposed the maximum sentence permitted under Indiana law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">That part of the trial court's judgment that ordered execution was vacated and the case was remanded with instructions that defendant be sentenced to the maximum prison sentence available under Indiana law for murder.</SPAN></P>

The court found that: (1) there had been sufficient proof of defendant's lawful detention on the burglary charge at the time of his escape; (2) the fact that defendant had gone over the wall and fled the area was sufficient evidence to permit a finding of the requisite intent; (3) the habitual offender sentencing had not been improper where the enhancement had been mandatory under the statute; and (4) there had been no showing of any prosecutorial vindictiveness or double jeopardy where the habitual offender punishment was imposed for the new crime rather than for the earlier crimes.</SPAN></P>

The trial court did not err in limiting defendant's discovery motion for all police reports of homicide investigations as of a certain date within the entire state. The burden upon the state was a proper consideration, and limiting the request to police reports only within the county for a four-year period was a reasonable compromise. The jury was able to discharge its duty notwithstanding the state's failure to disclose the details of the accomplice's plea agreement prior to the accomplice's substantive testimony. The jury was capable of reevaluating the credibility of a witness's testimony following the disclosure of facts indicating witness bias. The trial court did not err in imposing disparate sentences on defendant and his accomplice because of the special nature of a plea agreement and the roles each played in the robbery and murder.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that defendant was entitled to a reversal only if the evidence was without conflict and led unerringly to a conclusion contrary to the one reached by the trial court. The court found no such error by the trial court. The court noted that when defendant entered his plea, he indicated that he was doing so voluntarily and that the plea was not the result of any undue influence, coercion, or promises. The court held that there was no evidence supporting defendant's claim that the prosecutor implied that he would receive the death penalty if he did not make a plea.

The plan commission recommended passage of the amendment to the city council. The council rejected the amendment. Neither the plan commission nor the council took any further action. Appellees then sought a judgment declaring first that the council's rejection of the amendment was arbitrary and second, that the amendment was enacted by operation of law because the council failed to take action under the 500 series. The trial court granted summary judgment for appellees on their second claim, and the appellate court affirmed the judgment. The court granted the city's petition to transfer and reversed the trial court's judgment. While amendments to the master plan required compliance with the 500 series, an amendment to a zoning ordinance, which allowed rezoning of a particular tract of land, required compliance with Ind. Code &sect;&sect; 36-7-4-600 - 36-7-4-612 (1981) (600 series). Because appellees sought to have the vendor's land rezoned, the 600 series applied; therefore, the amendment was not enacted by operation of law based on the council's failure to take action under the 500 series.</SPAN></P>

In his petition for post-conviction relief, defendant claimed that the admission of a witness's identification testimony violated his rights to cross-examination and confrontation as a result of the hypnosis of the witness and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. The trial court denied his petition. The court affirmed, holding that there was no persuasive evidence that the witness's identification of defendant as the triggerman was the result of hypnosis. The witness made a positive identification of defendant when he viewed defendant in a line-up. Defendant's counsel's decision to concentrate on discrediting one of the participants in the crime instead of the witness who identified defendant as the triggerman was trial strategy that did not rise to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. Although defendant's counsel should have presented additional evidence in mitigation besides the testimony of defendant's mother, that testimony itself emphasized that there may have been tactical reasons why more witnesses were not called.</SPAN></P>

The conviction was followed by an incident in which the passenger in defendant's vehicle delivered a kilo of cocaine to an undercover officer. At the time of defendant's arrest, a semi-automatic pistol and a sawed-off shotgun were found inside his vehicle. Defendant alleged numerous errors on appeal, including that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, that certain evidence was erroneously admitted, and that the superior court abused its discretion in sentencing him. The court affirmed, holding that defendant's claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel was without merit because there was no showing that his counsel's performance was deficient. The court held that because the criminal enterprise between defendant and his co-conspirator was sufficiently established, the admission of the co-conspirator's statements against defendant was proper under the co-participant exception to the hearsay rule. The court concluded that due to the nature of the crime and defendant's character, the sentences imposed were not manifestly unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

However, the court disagreed and affirmed his conviction finding sufficient evidence to support it. Defendant also argued that certain photographs were erroneously admitted into evidence because they failed to establish any element or fact surrounding the shooting and they were introduced to prejudice and inflame the passions of the jury. The court again disagreed and held that the evidence was properly admitted to show defendant's anger and jealousy of the victim, which proceeded the shooting. Furthermore, the evidence tended to complete the story of the crime. Therefore it was admitted under the res gestae exception to the rule prohibiting evidence of a separate crime. Defendant also argued that he was denied a fair trial. The court found that defendant offered no evidence of actual harm resulting from the jurors seeing him in handcuffs and was thus had not been denied a fair trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Plaintiff county council appealed an order of the Lake Superior Court (Indiana) granting summary judgment in favor of defendant utility, effectively denying the county its requested declaratory relief in its action against defendants, township trustees, poor relief recipients, and utility creditors. The county had sought a declaration that the Distressed Township and Poor Relief Acts were unconstitutional under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The county claimed that all debt incurred by the township in excess of two percent of its assessed valuation was in violation of Ind. Const. art. XIII, &sect; 1, and that the obligation of such debts was therefore void and the statutes requiring the county to pay them were unconstitutional. The township trustees had declared the township distressed, thus triggering the provisions of the Distressed Township Act of 1986. Despite funding from the State, the county refused to institute any plan claiming that poor relief was the obligation of the township and not the county. The issue for review was the finding by the trial court that poor relief was ultimately the responsibility of the county and thus was governed by its constitutional debt limit rather than that of the township. Affirming, the court agreed that the county had an affirmative duty to fund the township poor relief whether it was to be reimbursed by the township or not. The obligation of the county to be ultimately responsible for poor relief was not initiated by the Distressed Township Act in 1986, but had been in effect since 1935. Therefore the obligations resulting from the distress of the township did not become void.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The injured driver's car was struck when the drunk driver's blood alcohol content was .25 percent. The police ticketed the drunk driver for driving while intoxicated, and the prosecutor later charged him with driving while intoxicated. The injured driver brought a negligence action. The court found that the most it could say about precedent on the subject was that it had prohibited the unlimited imposition of punitive damages on the grounds that such violated the spirit of the state constitution, but absent a constitutional prohibition, the legislature was free to reform the state's substantive law in this field, and it had done so; therefore the drunk driver was not entitled to partial summary judgment on the issue of punitive damages. The court instructed that Ind. Code &sect; 34-4-30-2 did not violate double jeopardy and that the drunk driver could not assert the possibility of criminal punishment as a defense to a claim for punitive damages.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The commission charged the judge with willful misconduct in office, in violation of the Model Code of Judicial Conduct (code) Canons 1 and 2. The judge filed a motion to dismiss the statement of charges and an alternative motion to dismiss. The court denied the motions. In rejecting the judge's claim that the charges were unconstitutionally vague, the court found that a greater degree of flexibility was permitted with respect to judicial disciplinary rules than was allowed in criminal statutes and that the charges were sufficiently precise to provide the judge, who had lengthy legal experience, with notice. The court treated the alternate motion to dismiss as a motion to dismiss, pursuant to Ind. R. Civ. P. 12(B)(6), and held that it was not convinced that the commission could not prove a set of facts that would support the willful misconduct charge. The court rejected the judge's claim that he could only be disciplined pursuant to Ind. Const. art. 7, &sect; 11. According to the court, the code was an enhancement of the provisions set forth in Ind. Const. art. 7, &sect; 4 and, thus, the code was a proper basis to charge misconduct.</SPAN></P>

The trial court vacated the involuntary manslaughter conviction.

The court affirmed. The court found that appellant's argument that he should have been convicted of involuntary manslaughter rather than felony murder was available to him at the time of his direct appeal. Because it was not raised at that time, the argument was waived for post-conviction review. Similarly, his argument that the felony murder rule was unconstitutional had been waived. The court concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its grant of a continuance to the prosecution and that appellant failed to identify any specific examples that lead unmistakably and unerringly to the conclusion that his appellate counsel was ineffective.</SPAN></P>

On the felony of dealing in a narcotic drug, the trial court sentenced him to 30 years' imprisonment, with 10 years suspended. On appeal, the court affirmed. The 20-year minimum mandatory sentence that defendant received for his cocaine dealing was constitutional because the sentence was not excessive or manifestly unreasonable. Defendant had no right to probation. Although evidence was admitted that had been obtained from the warrantless installation of a pen register on the phone of defendant's dealer, the phone did not belong to defendant, and therefore he lacked standing to question the necessity of a warrant.

During appellant's cross-examination on his sentencing hearing, he voluntarily testified that he had confessed to 20 or 25 burglaries as a clean-up statement. The trial court sentenced appellant to death and he sought review. The court affirmed, holding that the use of his clean-up statement did not constitute reversible error because there already was an aggravating factor, it was discovered after he had negotiated his plea, and it was not exculpatory evidence. The court held that the statement was properly used for impeachment purposes, together with other impeachment evidence. Further, an amended discovery order which was not overly oppressive to the prosecution was not error because he had a reasonable opportunity to discover a discriminatory practice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant was accused of molesting several grandchildren. The state filed a motion seeking to admit a videotaped statement of one of the molested children into evidence at trial. A statement was then videotaped without notifying defendant or giving her counsel the opportunity to attend. After a hearing pursuant to Ind. Code &sect; 35-37-4-6 (1987 Supp.), the trial judge admitted the statement and found the child competent but unavailable to testify at trial. Defendant was not allowed to cross-examine the child. The court of appeals held that admission of the videotape was proper. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court held that &sect; 35-37-4-6 was not unconstitutional per se under either the Sixth Amendment or Ind. Const. art. 1, &sect; 13. However, the court also held that: (1) by enacting &sect; 35-37-4-6, the legislature did not intend to restrict defendant's right of cross-examination but only to require that it occur in an atmosphere less traumatizing to the child victim; and (2) in order to comply with the Indiana Constitution, use of a statement videotaped under &sect; 35-37-4-6 had to be accompanied by some opportunity for cross-examination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court ruled that the admission of the videotaped statement of one of the molested children was not harmless error.

In the absence of any deprivation that affects his fair trial rights, the trial court did not have authority to order his release into the general prison population. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction as the jury could reasonably infer from defendant's actions he intended to use the guards as hostages. Although hearsay testimony should not have been admitted, he suffered no prejudice from the statements. Earlier testimony established that the prisoners threatened to kill the guards if their demands were not met and admitting the hearsay was harmless.

The court held there was sufficient evidence defendant had the requisite intent to commit the offenses where he purchased a gun within six hours of the offenses, prior to the offenses he told various people he intended to kill someone, and defendant's action during the commission of the killings indicated he possessed a knowing state of mind. The court determined the jury instructions regarding the death penalty, when read as a whole, were not misleading. The court concluded the trial court properly considered mitigating circumstances during its sentencing of defendant. The court found the death penalty statute,&nbsp;Ind. Code 35-50-2-9 (1979 Repl.), provided clear and specific guidance for imposing the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed a judgment that convicted defendant of murder and robbery and that sentenced defendant to the death penalty.

Code &sect; 35-50-2-8 (1985 Repl.). The trial court imposed a two-year term for the theft and enhanced that sentence by 30 years for the recidivist finding. Defendant argued that a 32-year sentence for the theft of $ 50 worth of merchandise violated both federal and state constitutions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The court affirmed the conviction. It held that defendant's sentence did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Because defendant was sentenced to a term of years, the court was not required to undertake a proportionality analysis. It found the sentence did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. The court also held that while Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 16 required it to determine proportionality, defendant's sentence was not a disproportionate penalty in light of his prior criminal record. His four previous felonies reflected a person who committed nonviolent crimes when not incarcerated. The trial court did not err in ordering defense counsel not to mention before the jury the possible penalty for the habitual offender finding. The jury had the right under Ind. Const. art. I, &sect; 19 to determine the law and the facts. The habitual offender finding was a means of sentencing and was not a determination of law. The trial court properly refused to allow defendant to testify about why he did not deserve to be considered a habitual criminal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant raised several grounds of error. Except for the restitution and fine orders, the court rejected each claim and affirmed the conviction. The court found that the lower court improperly ordered restitution and that its order imposing a fine failed to provide that defendant should not be imprisoned for failing to pay the court-ordered fine. The court reversed the restitution order and directed the lower court to amend its order regarding the fine. The court rejected defendant's claim of double jeopardy because the granting of his motion for mistrial removed any barrier to re-prosecution and did not implicate the constitutional protections against double jeopardy. The court also held that the lower court's time limitations on voir dire and closing arguments were not an abuse of its discretion. The court found that Miranda was inapplicable to the statements made to the police when they arrived at the crime scene or to statements made to a youth care worker while defendant was in custody and that were voluntary and not given under the influence of any drugs.

The court held that defense counsel's failure to file a trial brief, present a witness, dispute culpability, and failure to object to hearsay was not ineffective assistance of counsel because counsel's decisions were legitimate trial strategy, defendant was not prejudiced by those decisions, and the failure to present mitigating evidence resulted from defendant's boycott of the sentencing stage of trial. A prosecutor's comment during the close of the post conviction evidentiary hearing did not violate defendant's right to remain silent because it was made in response to defense counsel's statement and was directed to defendant's absence, not his silence. There was no error in denying a witness use immunity, because defendant had no right to have use immunity granted.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant sought to bring in evidence of his past sexual relations with the victim, which was denied by the trial court. Defendant offered an alibi defense to the rape charge. Defendant was convicted. On appeal the court affirmed. The court held that Ind. Code &sect; 35-37-4-4 required that in order for evidence concerning the victim's past sexual conduct with defendant to be admissible, the evidence had to be material to a fact at issue and its inflammatory or prejudicial nature could not outweigh its probative value. The court found that the past sexual conduct the victim had with defendant was not material because defendant claimed he didn't have intercourse with the victim at the time she was raped. Defendant claimed alibi, and thus, no issue of consent was presented. The court had found that the relationship the victim had with defendant was material to the issue of motive, and the trial court had properly allowed the victim to be cross-examined on the issue of the relationship, but not the sexual part of the relationship. The court found that defendant waived the issue of the trial court not recessing prior to the defense case because defendant failed to provide a complete record.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate was convicted of second degree murder. The trial court accepted the jury's recommendation and imposed a life sentence. The inmate argued that the trial court erred when it sentenced him because it believed that it was bound by the jury's recommendation. On review, the court found that the jury's decision regarding sentencing was a recommendation, which was not binding on the trial court. The court also found that the jury's sentence did not exceed constitutional boundaries and that the jury was provided with guidelines. The court concluded that the trial court's mistake was not reversible error. The inmate also claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial and appellate level regarding the applicability of the death penalty. The court found that trial counsel warned the inmate that a recent decision regarding the death penalty could make it applicable in his case. Even though it was not applicable, the court found that counsel properly assessed the risk in the inmate's favor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">The inmate kidnapped his victim at knife point and raped her. The court rejected the inmate's contention that the post-conviction relief court erred in denying his petition without issuing specific findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court held that although Ind. R. Crim. R. P. 1, &sect; 6 required a trial court considering a petition for post-conviction relief to make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, automatic reversal for failure to do so was not required because the rule functioned primarily for the benefit of an appellate court. The court found the inmate failed to meet his burden of demonstrating he was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel. The court noted that representing the inmate (then defendant) and a co-defendant did not constitute ineffective representation per se. The court found no errors with respect to sentencing despite the fact that the sentence imposed upon retrial for the same charges was considerably more severe because the sentence was within the permissible scope. Finally, the court determined that because the inmate was a violent offender, he was not subject to treatment under the criminal sexual deviant statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Marion Superior Court, Criminal Division VI (Indiana), which convicted defendant of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. Defendant was convicted of a Class A felony based on the total weight of 100 bindles of heroin seized from his home. Defendant argued that the evidence supported no more than a Class D felony conviction for the possession of less than three grams of heroin.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c8">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Defendant argued that because the total mixture of each bindle contained trace amounts of heroin and since the police conducted only preliminary tests on some of the separate bindles, it was improper for police to empty the contents of each of the bindles seized to determine the total heroin content. On appeal, the court disagreed. The separate bindles were uniform in size, the contents were uniform in appearance, and there was no issue as to what the precise quantity was in each individual bindle. Moreover, the statutes involving controlled substance dealing intentionally utilized the weight of the entire substance delivered. Thus, the method of ascertaining the quantity was proper and it resulted in evidence sufficient to support the Class A felony charge. Further, the State's evidence negating defendant's claim that the large quantity of heroin seized was for his own use was a sufficient basis from which the jury could infer that defendant intended to sell the heroin. Finally, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow defendant to withdraw his jury trial waiver because there was nothing to support defendant's claim that the waiver was not knowingly made.</SPAN></P>
