</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizens sought to remove the elected official from his position as town supervisor due to his alleged misconduct in office. The elected official filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 36 was unconstitutional. In the alternative, the elected official sought to adjourn the proceeding pending termination of all criminal charges pending against him. The court denied the elected official's motion to dismiss and his motion to adjourn the proceeding. According to the court, &sect; 36 was constitutional and was designed to protect the citizens from the misconduct or malfeasance of elected officials. The court found that the elected official could be removed from office for violations of &sect; 36 incurred in his prior term of office and that his re-election did not constitute a condonation of the alleged acts of misconduct. The court further found that the citizens were not collaterally estopped from asserting grounds for the elected official's removal because there had been no litigation to that date, and the criminal proceeding was of a totally different nature. The court stated that the citizens were required to prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 36 of the Public Officers Law, which provides for removal from office&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a town or village official for misconduct, maladministration, malfeasance or malversation, is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad, since case law distinguishes between actual breach and mere oversight, reducing the statute's requirements to a determinable scope of conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner mother sought counsel fees in a proceeding that was brought against respondent father to collect child support. The father argued that the award was unjustifiable because of the mother's and/or the father's income and that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 438, which authorized the fee, unconstitutionally differentiated between males and females.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The mother moved for an order directing the father's payment of the mother's counsel fees in the mother's proceeding for child support. In response, the father argued that the award was unjustifiable because of the mother's and/or the father's income and that &sect; 438, which authorized the fee, unconstitutionally differentiated between males and females. In awarding the mother counsel fees, the court held that it was inappropriate to consider the mother's resources in relation to her application for counsel fees because precedent viewed child-support proceedings as of legal interest only to children, who were obviously without means to pay counsel. However, in reducing the fee award, the court held that it was required to take into account the father's reduced means and substantial debts. Finally, in upholding &sect; 438's constitutionality, the court held that the statute could be construed in accordance with its fundamental purpose to permit an award of legal fees to a male as well as a female, even if the legislature had not specifically contemplated the economic or legal developments relevant to fee awards on an equal basis for both sexes.</SPAN></P>

While the petitioner mother's source&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of income from gifts is as stable and predictable as income from earnings or investments and would be includible in determining her means, the resources of the mother should not be utilized in fixing counsel fees in a child-support proceeding.  Although the mother benefits from any payments awarded and is also obligated to provide support, to consider the mother's resources would work too great a departure from precedent holding that support payments are for the benefit of the children and the legal services provided are necessaries for which the father is liable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The requested counsel fee of $ 10,000 is too great in view of respondent's reduced means; and a fee of $ 950 should be awarded, with an additional $ 3,000 payable if respondent's taxable income increases to $ 50,000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. There should not be an escalating support order dependent upon respondent's income, since petitioner's income may also increase and she also has an obligation for child support.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mortgagors brought action pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 902, 903, and 904 for an order permitting action against defendant mortgagee under Truth-in-Lending Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1601 et seq., to be maintained as four class actions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mortgagors obtained a loan from defendant mortgagee to purchase a parcel of real property. Subsequently plaintiffs brought an action to dispute the accuracy of disclosures made by defendant and required by the Truth-in-Lending Act (Act), 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1601 et seq., and Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. &sect; 226. Plaintiffs then filed a motion to permit action to be maintained as four class actions. Defendant contended that the Act did not authorize class actions. The court held, however, that the Act referred to the bringing of a class action and set forth a maximum total recovery, thus class actions were specifically authorized by the Act. The court applied the predominance test and held that plaintiffs had established that there were questions of law and fact common to the proposed classes that predominated over any questions affecting individual class members. The fact that defendant's proposed defense was circumstantial or complex was insufficient to divest the class action of superiority. The court also noted that plaintiffs' claims were typical of those of proposed class.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court permitted plaintiffs to certify one class. All persons who had obtained mortgages on their property from defendant and who did not receive appropriate disclosures were included in class. Furthermore, the fact that plaintiffs could have been awarded damages under a different section of statute than class members or that they could have received a larger monetary award was insufficient to render their representation inadequate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An action to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  impose a penalty against defendant bank for alleged violations of the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act (US Code, tit 15, &sect; 1601 </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">et seq.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">)</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Regulation Z (12 CFR Part 226) in connection with the financing of real property transactions, may properly be maintained as a class action under CPLR article 9 with a class consisting of all persons who have received mortgage loans from defendant between July 15, 1974 and July 17, 1975 and who were not provided with the required disclosures. Plaintiffs obtained a mortgage loan from defendant in order to purchase a three-family house in Rochester, New York.  Plaintiffs allege that between July 15, 1974 and July 17, 1975 the disclosure statements delivered by defendant to mortgagors disclosed inaccurate annual percentage rates, that defendant unlawfully imposed insurance premiums for the benefit of the mortgagee which were not included in calculating the annual percentage rates, that defendant disclosed inaccurate amounts as title examination fees, and that defendant disclosed inaccurate amounts as &quot;prepaid finance charges&quot;.  The Truth-in-Lending Act, by setting the maximum total recovery in class action cases at &quot;the lesser of $ 100,000 or 1&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  per centum of the net worth of the creditor&quot; (US Code, tit 15, &sect; 1640, subd [a], par [2], cl [B]) permits recovery of the civil penalties provided for therein through the vehicle of a class action even though a statement expressly authorizing the maintenance of such class action to recover a penalty is not set forth therein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The action may properly be maintained as a class action under CPLR article 9 since the common factual questions relating to the procedures which defendant maintained to avoid errors in the required disclosures and the common questions of law of whether defendant's disclosures violated the statute predominate over any questions affecting individual class members.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class notwithstanding the fact that they seek their full $ 1,000 maximum statutory penalties as individuals (US Code, tit 15, &sect; 1640, subd [a], par [2], cl [A]) while also attempting to recover potentially reduced awards for the represented class.  Plaintiffs' proposed notice to potential members of the class fully disclosing in plain and easily comprehensible language, the ranges of recovery as a class member and as an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  individual, as well as the relative rights, risks and responsibilities of each class member in a class action as opposed to an individual action, satisfies the interests of justice by giving each proposed class member a choice of procedural remedies and allowing participation by aggrieved persons who might otherwise be deprived of a remedy because of the practical hardships characteristic of such litigations.  The fact that plaintiffs may receive a larger monetary award than the class members is not sufficient to render their representation inadequate.  The interest of plaintiffs is coextensive with that of the proposed class members to the extent that plaintiffs will be obliged to prove, even if they sue individually, that defendant's procedures were inadequate to the entire class.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attacked the constitutionality of &sect; 664, which barred government employees from grand jury service, claiming that the statute violated due process and equal protection. In upholding &sect; 664 on equal protection grounds, the court held there was no showing of how the statutory exclusion adversely affected defendant. The court held that it was not alleged, nor could it be alleged, that defendant was singled out for special or unequal treatment, different from that afforded every other indicted defendant in New York. The court also held that because defendant, who was not a public employee, was not a member of the excluded class, it was all the more tenuous to claim that the class's expulsion had a constitutionally unequal impact upon defendant. In upholding &sect; 664 on due process grounds, the court held that &sect; 664 was constitutionally sound and that it did not excise, without justification, a segment of the population in a way which unsuitably deprived defendant of grand jury cross-sectionality. In so holding, the court noted that &sect; 664 prevented public employees from investigating official corruption and allowed public employees to serve other compelling state interests.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Upon a motion by defendant, seeking dismissal of an indictment, whereby he attacks the constitutionality, on due process and equal protection grounds, of section 664 of the Judiciary Law by which government employees are barred from Grand Jury service, as a result of which, defendant claims, the Grand Jury which indicted him was illegally constituted, the motion is denied.  The mere employment of the term &quot;unequal protection&quot; in defendant's moving papers does not even begin to make it so, and there is no showing of how he is affected at all by it, much less adversely affected. For equal protection&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  purposes, the motion is rejected that defendant, not alleged to be a public employee, is somehow unequally treated by the elimination of public employees from all Grand Juries in New York State.  Nor, for due process purposes, has defendant carried his burden of establishing any constitutional ailment. The disqualification is based on the belief that Grand Juries, because they investigate official corruption, should not be composed of public employees, and it has long been recognized that the Sovereign may constitutionally exclude from jury service certain professions or groups because the exclusion would free its members to serve other compelling State interests.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's indictment arose out of an alleged offer to give public employment and money to a potential political foe to induce him not to enter a primary election against defendant who was already an elected legislator. The state claimed that the offers were made in a series of conversations that were tape-recorded by the political foe at the direction of the special state prosecutor. The court held that the evidence revealed by the special prosecutor's investigation was admissible. The special prosecutor had specific authority by an executive order that was well within the constitutional limits of the government's police powers. The court also held that defendant was entitled to a plenary hearing pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Laws &sect;&sect; 710.30, 710.40 because he raised a sufficient constitutional question concerning the voluntariness of his statements. The court dismissed the count of official misconduct, N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 195.00, because it only charged corrupt motive in appointing an employee and not the necessary element that he committed an unauthorized act outside the scope of his official duties. As to defendant's other counts, the court rejected defendant's claims.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the special prosecutor's investigation was illegal, granted defendant's motion for a plenary hearing, dismissed the count alleging official misconduct, granted defendant's motion for discovery of the taped conversations and evidence favorable or exculpatory to defendant, but denied his motion for a bill of particulars and discovery in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery in the third degree, after which he was paroled. Subsequently, he was arrested for alleged parole violations and given a parole revocation hearing. At the conclusion of the hearing the board revoked defendant's parole and ordered him to be held to the maximum extent of his sentence, without consideration of any good behavior allowance. Defendant moved by way of writ of habeas corpus for his release. On appeal the court ordered the board to recompute defendant's sentence by allowing him any good behavior credits to which he may have become entitled. The court held that N.Y. Correct. Law &sect; 803(1), denying good behavior allowances to a parolee with less than one year of his maximum term remaining, effected unequal treatment of inmates who were paroled and then returned to custody. The court stated that there was no logical basis for differentiating between violators who owed more than one year on their maximum sentences and those who owed less in determining if they were eligible for good behavior allowances. The court found that such a procedure clearly discriminated against a certain segment of the class and resulted in unequal treatment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 5 of section 803 of the Correction Law, which provides that a parole violator is entitled to good behavior time allowances against the unexpired maximum of his sentence following his reincarceration only if the remaining portion of his maximum term &quot;is more than one year&quot;, unconstitutionally results&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in unequal treatment of inmates.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner's parole was properly revoked, resulting in his reincarceration, following a parole revocation hearing for illegally possessing methadone, amassing a large number of unpaid parking violations and possessing 40 rounds of ammunition for a .35 caliber rifle.  After observing a puncture mark on petitioner's arm, petitioner's parole officer searched an attache case that petitioner was carrying, discovering a plastic bottle containing methadone residue. A subsequent search of petitioner's car disclosed five more plastic bottles containing methadone residue and a number of unanswered parking summonses.  The search of petitioner's room at his father's house disclosed the 40 rounds of ammunition. The plastic bottles, the unanswered parking tickets and the ammunition were not&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  obtained as the result of an unlawful search and seizure.  Any parolee expressly consents to a search of his person or residence as a condition of his parole ( Rules of the Board of Parole, 7 NYCRR 1915.10).  Since the residence of petitioner's father was petitioner's &quot;approved residence&quot;, the search was proper.  There was no necessity for scientific tests to determine the nature of the residue in the plastic bottles since petitioner admitted that it was methadone.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The parole board must furnish petitioner with a statement of the reasons for the determination revoking parole and of the evidence relied upon ( 7 NYCRR 1925.35 [1]).  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The movant county brought a motion to dismiss two petitions filed under &sect; 232 of the Family Court Act to determine educational services for alleged handicapped children.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parents of the alleged handicapped children filed petitions with the court asking for an order directing the county to pay the balance of the tuition cost, if any, and to pay whatever portion of the maintenance cost for the child in his or her special school the parents were unable to afford. The portion paid by the county, pursuant to N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 4403, was subject to 50 percent reimbursement by the state. The county, by its motion, objected to any order being made against the county that would compel it to bear the tuition or maintenance expenses on the grounds that the costs were properly and legally the burden of the respective school districts and the education department. The motion was opposed by the school districts, the commissioner, and by some of the parents of the handicapped children. The court held that the county failed in its burden to establish the unconstitutionality of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 4403(2) and &sect; 232(a)(1) of the Family Court Act based upon the classification of being designated a handicapped child.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The delay of the county in answering or moving with respect to the petitions is immaterial, since the parties were sufficiently informed of the intentions of the county.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.

Although the contents of the newspapers defendant was selling would have been classified as &quot;radical,&quot; whether one agreed with that point of view or not, the members of the group whose ideas were expressed in the newspaper had a constitutional right to communicate their opinions to others. Any requirement that a license or permit be first obtained before a newspaper could have been sold upon the city streets was an act of censorship.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The application of a city &quot;Hawking and Peddling Ordinance&quot; to require a license for defendant's sale of newspapers on the street violates the First Amendment protection of freedom of the press, since it constitutes a form of censorship and a prior restraint by its inherently pervasive threat, regardless of whether the license is for distribution, rather than publication, or sale, rather than free distribution.  A newspaper may not be deemed a mere commodity offered for sale, and any dangers and annoyances occasioned by its sale may be controlled by other means than the requirement of a license. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before the court were cross motions for summary judgment filed by plaintiffs, the collective bargaining unit and the employees, and by defendants, the city, the employer, which was an agency of the State, and the State, in an action challenging the &quot;wage freeze&quot; provision of &sect; 10 of the New York State Financial Emergency Act for the City of New York (FEA), 1975 N.Y. Laws 868, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There was no dispute that employer refused to pay the employees the salary increments due under the parties' collective bargaining agreement because of the enactment of FEA. The court held that in response to the city's then present fiscal crisis, a suspension of all wage increases was a reasonable exercise of the State's police power. While no certain date was provided for the payment of the suspended wages, provision was made that the payment would have been no later than the end of the &quot;emergency period.&quot; The court held that the suspension of the benefits due to the employees did not impair their collective bargaining agreement. The employees' right to an increment under the subject bargaining agreement had been temporarily suspended; it had not been permanently abolished. Consequently, there was no merit to the argument that the employees had been deprived of property without just compensation. The court also held that the employees were not denied equal protection of the laws. They did not demonstrate that they were bearing a disproportionate share of the burden in the fiscal crisis as compared to other interest groups in the public and private sector.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal corporations -- &quot;wage freeze&quot; for New York City employees -- impairment of contract -- New York State Financial Emergency Act for City of New York (L 1975, ch 868, &sect; 2), suspending all wage increases for municipal employees because of city's fiscal crisis, is reasonable exercise of State's police power which does not unconstitutionally impair plaintiffs' collective bargaining agreement (US Const, art I, &sect; 10, subd 1); payment of suspended wages is to be made no later than end of &quot;emergency period&quot; -- &quot;wage freeze&quot; does not deprive plaintiffs of property without just compensation; salary increments have been temporarily suspended, not permanently abolished -- &quot;wage freeze&quot; does not contravene Bankruptcy and Supremacy Clauses of Federal Constitution -- plaintiffs have not been denied equal protection; they were given equal opportunity to enter into voluntary deferral agreement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York State Financial Emergency Act for the City of New York (L 1975, ch 868, &sect; 2), which suspended all wage increases for municipal employees because of the city's&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  present fiscal crisis, is a reasonable exercise of the State's police power which does not unconstitutionally impair plaintiffs' collective bargaining agreement (US Const, art I, &sect; 10, subd 1).  Plaintiffs form an unincorporated association that bargains collectively for the physicians employed by defendant New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation.  As a result of the enactment of the &quot;wage freeze&quot;, defendants refused to pay plaintiffs the salary increments due.  The police power of the State may be reasonably exercised in directly preventing the immediate enforcement of contractual obligations, by a temporary and conditional restraint, where public interests would otherwise suffer.  Payment of the suspended wages is to be made no later than the end of the &quot;emergency period&quot; which is to be determined by the Emergency Financial Control Board in accordance with the accounting method prescribed for the expense budget of the city by the State Comptroller.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The &quot;wage freeze&quot; legislation does not unconstitutionally deprive plaintiffs of property without just compensation.  Plaintiffs' right to a salary increment has been temporarily suspended, not permanently abolished.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &quot;wage freeze&quot; does not contravene the Bankruptcy and Supremacy Clauses of the Federal Constitution (US Const, art I, &sect; 8, subd 4; art VI, &sect; 2).  The suspension of plaintiffs' increased wages constitutes an extension plan rather than a composition plan (US Code, tit 11, &sect; 403, subd [a]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs have not been denied equal protection of the law.  Plaintiffs were given the equal opportunity to enter into a voluntary deferral agreement but instead chose to challenge the constitutionality of the freeze legislation.  Therefore, they may not validly complain that their rights to increased wages should be deferred instead of suspended. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, a narcotics counselor at a public school who killed a 14-year-old girl who threatened to report him to his superior for smoking marijuana, was not acting under the &quot;influence of extreme emotional disturbance&quot; (Penal Law, &sect; 125.25, subd 1, par [a]) at the time of the homicide and is, therefore, guilty of murder in the second degree. Defendant's conduct and statements do not demonstrate the influence of extreme emotional disturbance which would have reduced the crime to manslaughter in the first degree.  Extreme emotional disturbance is the emotional state of an individual who has no mental disease or defect (Penal Law, &sect; 30.05) and who has an extreme emotional reaction to an extremely unusual and overwhelming stress, as a result of which there is a loss of self-control and reason is overborne by intense feelings such as passion, anger, distress, grief or excessive agitation.  Defendant made a complete, detailed, taped confession within eight hours of the homicide. He stated that he drove around with the victim to dissuade her from reporting him.  When he found she was not being swayed, he parked the car, tied&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the victim's hands in front of her with a piece of cloth, twice hit her over the head with a large rock, drove a steel hair pin several times into her larynx and chest and then stabbed her with a piece of auto stripping to assure that she was dead.  A subsequent confession made nine months after the arrest wherein defendant claimed he accidently struck the victim in the head with a 45-pound rock while he was acting in self-defense is not credible.  Although defendant was exposed to an unusual stress, the threat of a 14-year-old student was neither extremely unusual nor overwhelming. Defendant's actions were too contrived and calculating to conclude that he lost his self-control. Defendant drove the victim around for hours trying to dissuade her before killing her.  Defendant made a calm decision to kill the victim and then made sure that she was not still alive to &quot;get him&quot;.  Defendant's taped confession was inconsistent with a claim of extreme emotional disturbance. Instead of exhibiting unusual excitement or speaking in the slow monotone of depression, defendant spoke directly, coherently, relevantly and productively.  He was candid, expressed no guile and was very matter of fact.  </SPAN></P>

The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictments, holding that the applicable statute of limitations was the statute in effect the proceedings were started, not the statute in effect at the time the offenses took place. The court also held that the instructions given the grand jury after the defendant had been called before the grand jury and refused to testify on the basis of U.S. Const. amend. V correctly advised the grand jury not to consider his refusal to testify in determining whether to hand down an indictment. The court further held that the evidence before the grand jury was sufficient to hand down an indictment because corroboration of accomplice testimony was not required for an indictment, though is was required for a conviction under N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Prosecution of defendant, a former Judge of the Criminal Court of the City of New York, for offenses involving misconduct in office is subject to the five-year Statute of Limitations, tolled by continuation in service, under CPL 30.10 (subd 3, par [b]), notwithstanding that the activity out of which the charges arose occurred when the two-year period under section 142 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was applicable, since the longer limitations period went into effect prior to the expiration of the initial two-year period.  CPL 1.10 (subd 2) requires application of Code of Criminal Procedure provisions only if the otherwise mandated provisions of the CPL would result in injustice and is inapplicable since it relates only to proceedings commenced prior to the effective date of the CPL.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The application of CPL 30.10 (subd 3, par [b]) is ex post facto, since a defendant has no vested interest&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the Statute of Limitations extant at the time of his criminal act; and the statutory period may be extended at any time prior to its expiration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  CPL 30.10 (subd 3, par [b]) does not unconstitutionally treat public office holders unequally under the law, since the inherent nature of the circumstances surrounding offenses by public office holders often leaves the offenses undiscovered until the incumbent has left office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A pre-indictment delay of four and one-half years does not violate the defendant's right to due process, since the delay was not occasioned by the prosecution but by unawareness that a crime had been committed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The prosecutor's action in calling the defendant before the Grand Jury, although aware that the defendant would assert his Fifth Amendment privilege, was not improper, since the prosecutor cautioned the jurors that defendant's silence could not be held against him.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The defendant was not prejudiced by testimony of several witnesses before the Grand Jury relating to matters other than the charges against defendant, since an investigating Grand Jury often deals with a number of related matters and the challenged testimony was at most a distraction. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Defendant's motion to dismiss one count of the indictment for legal insufficiency and failure to set forth a statement of the facts supporting each element of the offense is denied without prejudice to a new motion, since the People have been directed to file a bill of particulars.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a second felony offender, filed a motion to be sentenced under prior existing drug laws for his conviction of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class C felony under the amended penal law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sale and possession of methadone, a class A-II felony at the time of his indictment. Prior to trial, the law regarding possession and sale of methadone was changed to lessen the severe penalties attached to such crimes. The court reduced the charge to a class A-III felony. Defendant was convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, a class C felony under the amended law. Defendant, a second felony offender, claimed that due to his predicate felony status, sentencing, pursuant to the amended penal laws, could result in the imposition of a longer minimum sentence. Defendant's motion to be sentenced under the old penal law was denied. The new statutes were designed to ameliorate the severe penalties imposed under the old drug laws and, therefore, were not an unconstitutional retroactive application of the law. Defendant, if sentenced for a class C felony as a second-felony offender, could have received a maximum sentence of 6 to 15 years; whereas if he were sentenced under the old statute, a mandatory maximum sentence of life imprisonment was possible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant was convicted of criminal sale of methadone, a class C felony (Penal Law, &sect; 220.34).  As a second felony offender convicted of a C felony, defendant must be&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  given a maximum sentence of at least six years and no more than 15 years, with a minimum sentence fixed at one half of the maximum (Penal Law, &sect; 70.06).  Defendant had originally been charged with a class A-III felony. However, prior to trial, the law respecting possession and sale of methadone was changed to lessen the severe penalties attached to such crimes and made retroactive (L 1975, chs 785, 786).  The maximum term for a class A felony is life imprisonment and the minimum may be set at not less than one year nor more than eight years and four months.  The fact that sentencing pursuant to the retroactive application of the recently enacted Penal Law revisions might result in the imposition of a longer minimum sentence for defendant due to his predicate felony status does not constitute harsher punishment in violation of the prohibition against ex post facto legislation (US Const, art I, &sect; 9, subd 3).  The statute does not increase the punishment to be imposed and in fact is designed to ameliorate the harsh penalties imposed under the old statute and to extend the benefits of the new law to those who committed methadone offenses prior to the effective date of the statute.  A&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  sentence of three to six years is not more severe than an indeterminate sentence of life imprisonment with a possible minimum sentence of one year.  An indeterminate sentence is regarded as a sentence for the maximum term. Defendant's maximum exposure of 6 to 15 years, as opposed to a mandatory maximum sentence of life imprisonment, would be reduced under the new statutory scheme.  Moreover, legislative amendments increasing the minimum sentence under an indeterminate sentence structure where maximum sentence remains constant, do not increase punishment so as to violate the ex post facto clause. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The New York laws authorizing the adoption of an out-of-wedlock child upon its mother's death without the consent of the putative father while requiring the father's consent for adoption of a legitimate child (Social Services Law, &sect; 384, subd 1, par [d]; Domestic Relations Law, &sect; 111) are constitutional.

The primary concern of the Legislature and the courts is the welfare of the children involved.  The public interest in the adoption of out-of-wedlock children by strangers to the mother in order to secure &quot;homes to the homeless&quot; and a &quot;normal home for a child&quot; has priority over the claim of a right of veto by unwed fathers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An unwed father's right to a hearing at which he can seek to show that adoption is not in the child's best interests rests on his unequivocal identification as the father through his acknowledgment of paternity in a paternity proceeding or by the use of his name on the child's birth certificate together with his cohabitation. The putative father herein is not entitled to such hearing since he was in prison when the child was born in June, 1970, has never lived with the child and did not apply to the foster-care agency for visitation until May, 1973.  Notice and a best interests hearing should be accorded only if there is substantial justification for burdening the adoption process. Accordingly, the subject child is free for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  adoption without his putative father's consent, without efforts by petitioner foster-care and adoption agency to establish a relationship between him and the child, and without the institution of an abandonment proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After dancing nude on the restaurant's premises, the dancers were arrested without a warrant, and charged with obscenity. Thereafter, the restaurant sought a judgment declaring that the warrantless arrests without prior judicial scrutiny of the dancing were unconstitutional and also sought a permanent injunction against such warrantless arrests on the restaurant's premises. In refusing to declare the warrantless arrests unconstitutional or to issue an injunction, the court held that because of the ephemeral nature to dancing, utilizing judicial time to investigate such performances would be unwarranted, burdensome, and inappropriate. The court also held that the authorities did not go so far as to require prior judicial scrutiny in every obscenity case. Moreover, the court held that the forum to test the arrests' constitutionality was the criminal court. Furthermore, the court held that it was impossible to draft an injunction because of the variation in live performances from time to time and day to day. Finally, the court held that a temporary injunction would not issue where there was a dispute as to the facts and the relief sought was obtainable in a plenary trial.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After four women had performed totally nude before patrons of a restaurant, the police made warrantless arrests, charging them and two men with obscenity and promoting obscenity. In an action by the restaurant for a declaration that the warrantless arrests without prior judicial scrutiny of the allegedly obscene activity were unconstitutional and for an injunction against the making of such arrests on the restaurant premises, a motion by it for a preliminary injunction against such arrests is denied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. No cases have been cited or found requiring prior judicial scrutiny before warrantless arrests may be made for live performances which are allegedly obscene, and, unlike fixed and definite material which is obviously capable of prior judicial scrutiny, a live performance is hardly likely to be repeated in the same manner from time to time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The affidavit of the arresting officer describes a performance which could reasonably be found obscene under the obscenity statute, which appears to meet constitutional standards, and the forum to test the constitutionality of that statute is in the Criminal Court.  If the performance was obscene, the warrantless&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  arrests, for a class A misdemeanor committed in the police officer's presence, were proper.  Under the circumstances, the court is without authority to intervene to enjoin the enforcement of the penal statute.

The court denied defendant's motion to dismiss, and held that &sect; 240.25 was not unconstitutional or too vague to be capable of enforcement. It was rather a question of evidence to be produced at trial as to whether defendant's conduct met the standards necessary to obtain a conviction under &sect; 240.25.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with the gang rape of a woman. Their lawyer filed a motion to challenge the lawfulness of the warrantless arrest of the defendants in private premises and to suppress, as the tainted fruit of that arrest, evidence later seized in those same premises in a search conducted with the consent of one of the defendants. The court found that the police arrested the defendants without a warrant and without announcing themselves before entering the apartment where they were hiding. However, the officers had questioned one of the defendant's brothers, who led the officers to the apartment where the defendants were hiding. The court found that the officers had good reason to believe that the brother, willing to co-operate with them for the good of his sibling, would lead them to the place where all of the suspects were hiding. Therefore, the court found that the officers had probable cause to arrest the defendants. Furthermore, the court found that the officer's entry through ruse was not unconstitutional. Therefore, the defendants' motion was denied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' motion to suppress was denied.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After being sexually assaulted and robbed, the complainant identified defendants and a juvenile to the investigating police officer.  Follow-up officers went to the home of the juvenile where the juvenile's brother offered to assist the officers in locating him.  The brother took them to an apartment where, after identifying himself, the door was opened by one of the defendants.  Thereupon the officers entered the apartment and arrested defendants and the juvenile. Later one of the defendants took the officers back to the apartment where he aided&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  them in retrieving several items of personal property which had been identified in the first police officer's report as having been taken from the complainant's apartment. Upon defendants' motion to challenge the warrantless arrests and to suppress the evidence seized in the apartment, the motion is denied.  In the face of a motion to suppress, presumptive probable cause must be buttressed by reliable, nonhearsay evidence.  At the suppression hearing the People bolstered the hearsay police report of the initial investigating officer, which was relied upon by the arresting officer, with the testimony of the complaining witness, thus adequately demonstrating by nonhearsay evidence that the arresting officer had reasonable cause to arrest defendants without a warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The police entry into the private premises by trick or ruse to execute the warrantless arrest did not amount to an illegitimate &quot;breaking&quot; which violated either CPL 140.15 (subd 4) and CPL 120.80 (subds 4, 5) or the Fourth Amendment. While Federal case law holds that a ruse entry does not constitute a &quot;breaking&quot;, the officer must have probable cause to believe that the person he is attempting to arrest, with or without&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a warrant, is present in the premises at the time in question.  The officers here had good reason to believe that the brother of one of their suspects was willing to co-operate with them for the good of his sibling, and would lead them to the place where all of the suspects were hiding.  </SPAN></P>

Because the appropriation bill was passed in lump sum form, and because the subject positions and programs were not specifically designated for deletion by the legislature itself in the bill, it followed that the recommendation of the legislative committees to delete the positions and programs was ineffectual to accomplish that purpose and the executive departments had the power to implement and administer as they thought best.

The court applied a two-part test and determined that on its face the statute was constitutional. However, the statute's application toward the producer rendered it unconstitutional.

The court found that the product did not fall within the prohibition of the section pleaded, for it was a &quot;substitute&quot; rather than an &quot;imitation.&quot; The court found that the producer's product was a synthetic product separate and distinct from eggs and its advertising fairly gave the buyer the choice of purchasing and eating it or of purchasing and eating natural eggs. Therefore, it was a separate product and the commissioner's attempt to require it to be considered and labeled as an imitation was arbitrary and capricious.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Subdivision 3 of section 201 of the Agriculture and Markets Law, which requires that an imitation product must contain the word &quot;imitation&quot; in its label, is constitutional on its face.  It is no constitutional infringement on any manufacturer or processor of food to require that the public be so informed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute has been applied against defendant, which produces the food product known as &quot;Second Nature, Cholesterol Free Egg Substitute&quot;, in an unconstitutional manner.  This product as offered for sale to the public does not attempt to &quot;imitate&quot; fresh eggs in violation of the statute.  Neither the packaging nor the name of the product suggests eggs. Moreover, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  word &quot;substitute&quot; does not convey the impression that the buyer is purchasing a pure egg product, but rather something that is used in place or instead of one.  Accordingly, since &quot;Second Nature&quot; is a separate product and cannot be said to be an imitation, the commissioner's attempt to require it be so considered and labeled is arbitrary and capricious. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The village refused to issue certificates of occupancy for the residential use of four homes and sought to enjoin their use because the subdivision in which they were built never installed improvements such as a sewer system. The owner and occupants brought a counterclaim, seeking a declaratory judgment that they did not have to obtain the certificates, or in the alternative, an order compelling the issuance of the certificates. The court denied the village's motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed the case. The court held that (1) the village could secure compliance with its certificate of occupancy requirement; (2) the village had the choice of requiring prior completion of necessary improvements before approving the plat, or accepting performance bonds guaranteeing completion in the future; (3) having chosen to rely on performance bonds as an alternative to awaiting prior completion of the improvements, the village could not demand the prior completion of the improvements as well; (4) and the owner's investment in the building on reliance upon plats approved and filed under an existing state statute precluded retrospective declaration that the statute was illegal.</SPAN></P>

The People alleged that the New York City Police Department Rules and Procedures ch. 17/121.0(2) rectified the chilling effect of a five-day application period. The court found that the statute was not unconstitutional and concluded that a trial was necessary. The police department procedure permitted the issuance of a license in certain circumstances even if the event at which the bullhorn was to be used was less than five days from the application date.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Defendant, who has been hospitalized as incompetent to stand trial since 1964 and whose application to be converted to civil patient status on the ground that he would not regain competence to stand trial in the foreseeable future was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  denied following a hearing at which expert testimony was taken (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jackson v Indiana</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 406 U.S. 715), is not entitled to a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">de novo</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> rehearing before a different Judge pursuant to section 31.35 of the Mental Hygiene Law. The fact that civil patients hospitalized against their wishes are entitled to a rehearing pursuant to section 31.35 does not abridge defendant's right to equal protection of the law.

However, defendant's right to a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jackson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing for conversion to civil patient status is a creature of decisional law and has no statutory counterpart in the civil law. In cases where criminal defendants were improperly denied protection given civil patients, the issues were either mental illness itself or dangerousness.

The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jackson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> question only requires the determination of whether a defendant will regain the capacity to stand trial in the foreseeable future, a question unique to the criminal justice system.  There is no similar civil proceeding and therefore no civil statute which might be equally applied to a criminal defendant.  The scope of a </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Jackson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> hearing is so unique that defendants who seek relief may be treated differently from civil patients. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In 1973 plaintiff, a resident of Connecticut, was granted a judgment of divorce by a Connecticut court, which incorporated the terms of a separation agreement requiring defendant, a New York resident, to make semimonthly payments to her for alimony and child support. He made full payments for over two years, but, commencing in July, 1975, reduced his payments to one half of the required amounts.  In October, 1975 she obtained a contempt judgment from the Connecticut court, which directed defendant to pay her $ 3,493 in arrears for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  period up to October 16, 1975, plus $ 350 in counsel fees.  He failed to pay the amount of the contempt judgment, and also accumulated additional arrears of $ 3,165, and she now seeks enforcement, pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act ( CPLR art 54), of both Connecticut judgments, stating, in the affidavits required by that article, that $ 3,165 remains unpaid on the judgment of divorce and $ 3,843 remains unpaid on the contempt judgment. The judgment of divorce is found to be subject to enforcement under CPLR article 54, which may be used to enforce the financial provisions of a sister State divorce judgment or decree entitled to full faith and credit in this State except one obtained by default in appearance or confession of judgment. Since a sister State decree for alimony and support will be accorded full faith and credit as to any arrears if the right to the unpaid installments becomes absolute and vested as they become due, and since, under the law of Connecticut, past due support payments constitute vested property rights not subject to modification, plaintiff's judgment of divorce must be given full faith and credit as to any arrears.  However, since&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  defendant has established that he did not appear in the contempt proceeding, the contempt judgment is not subject to enforcement under CPLR article 54.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the Connecticut judgment of divorce is now to be regarded as a domestic judgment, plaintiff is entitled, upon her motion therefor, to entry of judgment in the amount of $ 3,165, the full amount requested, pursuant to section 244 of the Domestic Relations Law. She also seeks entry of judgment as to the arrears of $ 3,493 and the $ 350 counsel fees awarded in the contempt judgment. Although that judgment is not subject to enforcement, and although her affidavit accompanying the filing of the judgment of divorce did not refer to the arrears of $ 3,493, there has been substantial compliance with CPLR article 54 as regards those arrears, and the minor defect in the affidavit accompanying the judgment of divorce has been cured by virtue of the notice otherwise given to defendant as to them.  Therefore, entry of judgment as to those arrears is directed, but the relief sought is denied as to the $ 350 counsel fees, which award was not granted in the judgment of divorce.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Plaintiff also seeks wage attachment and posting of security, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  apparently only as to future payments of alimony and support and not as to the arrears, and to hold defendant in contempt. In view of the fact that he had been making full payments for over two years, that his reduced payments are of recent origin, that he is a professional man with an alleged substantial practice, and that this matter is before a New York court for the first time, the court, in its discretion, denies this relief.  However, plaintiff may renew her request therefor if defendant does not immediately resume full payments and pay all arrears involved, as well as the counsel fees awarded in the Connecticut contempt judgment and those now to be awarded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiff is entitled to counsel fees on the instant motion to enforce the payment of arrears, which relate, in part, to child support. Section 237 of the Domestic Relations Law provides that counsel fees are available upon any application concerning the &quot;maintenance of a child&quot;, and section 238 of that law provides that, in any proceeding pursuant to section 244 thereof, the court may require the husband to pay the wife's expenses in bringing, carrying on, or defending such proceeding.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Police officers entered a topless bar and observed the female defendants dancing completely nude. After observing what the officers believed to be obscene gestures by the female defendants, the officers arrested the defendants, with the females being charged with participating in an obscene performance and the male defendants being charged with promoting said performance. The court denied the defendant's motions to dismiss, holding that U.S. Const. amend. I, as applied to the states by U.S. Const. amend. XIV, did not offer protection for obscene acts, and that the arrests were not invalid due to the lack of prior judicial scrutiny because the arrest itself was not a judgment of obscenity. The court held that the police officers could be assumed to have the normal sensibilities and prudence to come to a reasonable belief that an obscene act was being performed in their presence, and under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 140.10 they had the authority to make arrests for a misdemeanor taking place in their presence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- participation in obscene performance -- prior judicial scrutiny -- defendants, two nude female dancers at topless bar, were lawfully arrested without prior judicial scrutiny for participating in obscene performance (</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Penal Law, &sect; 235.05</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">); prohibition of obscene physical conduct furthers substantial governmental interest outweighing any remote claim of First Amendment violation; chilling effect in depriving people from viewing nude dancer in topless bar is not such prior restraint as to reach First Amendment proportions -- mere arrest by police officer is not judgment of obscenity; police officer may lawfully make arrest pursuant to </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">CPL 140.10</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> based on reasonable belief that obscene act is occurring in his presence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. While dancing in a complete state of nudity during the course of a performance at a topless bar, defendants, two females, were lawfully arrested without prior judicial scrutiny and charged with participating in an obscene performance (Penal Law, &sect; 235.05).  Obscenity is not within the area of constitutionally protected speech or press.  Prohibition of obscene physical conduct is justified by the State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  since it furthers an important and substantial governmental interest, and this interest outweighs any remote claim of First Amendment violation.  The alleged chilling effect in depriving the People of the City of New York from viewing the gyrations of a nude dancer in a topless bar is not such a prior restraint as to reach First Amendment proportions. If there is any deprivation of expression to the performers themselves, it could not possibly come within the protection of the First Amendment which was originally intended to protect ideas, controversy, thought, and dissent.  It was not intended to be an &quot;anything goes&quot; institutional rationale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Even if prior restraint were to be considered, the mere arrest by the police officer is not in any way a judgment of obscenity. The imputation of obscenity to the movements and gestures of defendants is not a judicial finding but is merely the basis for an authorized arrest. A police officer possesses normal sensibilities and prudence which he can exercise in coming to the reasonable belief that an obscene act is occurring in his presence, thereby authorizing him to make an arrest under CPL 140.10.  The arrest differs in no degree from&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  any other arrest made pursuant to CPL 140.10 and therefore requires no prior judicial scrutiny. At a subsequent proceeding, the court will apply the standards set down by the Supreme Court for determination of obscenity. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appeared as a topless dancer and exposed her breasts in the course of her performance. Defendant alleged that Yonkers, N.Y., City Code &sect; 40-1 unconstitutionally violated her First Amendment rights and that the statute was unconstitutionally vague. The challenged statute forbade all topless exposure in a public place. The court held that the statute was overbroad and facially defective as an unwarranted interference with freedom of expression. The statute was all inclusive and did not permit any reasonable variance or divergence from its absolute proscriptive. It was so broad-brushed that it failed to solve the problem of nudity within constitutionally accepted limits.

Section 40-1 of the Yonkers City Code, which prohibits the exposure of a female's breasts in a public place &quot;whether or not such female is entertaining or performing in a play, exhibition, show or entertainment&quot;, violates First Amendment rights and is therefore invalid.  The law is overbroad and facially defective as an unwarranted interference with freedom of expression and thus cannot survive as a legitimate exercise of police power or&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as a valid regulation of public conduct.  The statute is so broad-brushed that it fails to solve, within constitutionally acceptable limits, the community problem of topless dancing.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, city, officials, zoological society, and veterinarians (city), filed motions to dismiss the complaint filed by plaintiffs, animal activists, seeking to close three of the city's zoos. The city argued that N.Y. Agric. &amp; Mkts.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs, various individuals and organizations who claim a special concern and interest about the welfare of animals and who seek to close the Central Park, Prospect Park and Flushing Meadow zoos, and to transfer the animals to the Bronx Zoo, have standing to bring a civil proceeding challenging conditions in the city zoos as constituting cruelty to animals in violation of sections 353, 356 and 370 of the Agriculture and Markets Law. The right to enforce the mandates of sections 353, 356 and 370 by civil action is implicit in these sections, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  notwithstanding the specific criminal sanction provided therein, and the enforcement procedures contained in sections 371 and 372 of the statute, which place the power to enforce these sections in the police and in societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals. Plaintiffs' allegations, if true, establish blatant cruelty to animals, and constitute far more than an attempt to formulate and enforce a &quot;zoo code&quot;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. By alleging the expenditure of public funds in an illegal manner, namely, maintenance of the zoos in violation of the Agriculture and Markets Law, proper causes of action for waste of public funds are stated in the complaint.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The allegation that mistreatment of animals constitutes a common-law nuisance fails to assert sufficient facts upon which to predicate a cause of action for nuisance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Plaintiffs lack standing to assert that New York Medical College has breached its contractual obligation to the city because of its purported failure to provide adequate veterinary services to the animals in the city's zoos. The contract is one for the benefit of a municipality and, therefore, is not enforceable by individual citizens on behalf of the municipality. Moreover, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  plaintiffs should not be treated as guardians ad litem for the animals, on the theory that the animals are third-party beneficiaries of the contract.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The claim that the city is presently illegally disposing of the animals to unqualified bidders or to those with poor zoo conditions, in violation of sections 353, 356 and 370 of the Agriculture and Markets Law, states a cause of action with respect to the city, but not the Bronx Zoo.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The allegation that the Bronx Zoo is equally responsible with the city for the welfare of the animals now in the city zoos, and is, therefore, along with the city, jointly and severally in violation of the Agriculture and Markets Law, fails to state a justiciable cause of action against the Bronx Zoo. The New York Zoological Society, known as the Bronx Zoo, is a private organization with no responsibility for the animals currently in the city's zoos. Nothing in section 532-9.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, which makes it lawful for the city to transfer animals to the society, requires the Bronx Zoo to accept any animals. Having no control over the animals now lodged in the city's zoos, the Bronx Zoo is not in violation of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the Agriculture and Markets Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Plaintiffs state an adequate claim for a summary inquiry on the conditions in the city zoos, pursuant to section 1109 of the New York City Charter.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant challenged the constitutionality of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 215.51 on the grounds of vagueness. The court held that the statute was constitutional and sufficiently defined the prohibited offense. Defendant alleged that some of the questions posed by the State were irrelevant to the Grand Jury's investigation. The court found that the questions were relative.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant was subpoenaed to appear before the Special Grand Jury investigating whether defendant and others had bribed officers of the New York City Police Department and had also corruptly conspired to dispose of certain pending criminal cases.  After being granted full immunity&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in two separate appearances before the Grand Jury, defendant refused to answer any questions put to him based on Fifth Amendment grounds.  As a result, defendant was charged with eight counts of criminal contempt in the first degree (Penal Law, &sect; 215.51).  The fact that some counts of the indictment may be duplicitous does not warrant a dismissal of the indictment at this pretrial juncture. If the indictment is duplicitous, the result will be a limitation on the quantum of punishment to be imposed if defendant is convicted after trial.  It is the number of separate subject areas covered by the questioning that should control when examining multiple Penal Law contempt charges for duplicitousness rather than the nature of the asserted grounds underlying several refusals to answer.  Once an immunized witness has refused to testify about a particular subject matter, subsequent refusals concerning the same matter during successive appearances before the Grand Jury are continuations of the initial refusal and only one Penal Law contempt charge covering that area should lie.  However, any questions of subject matter duplicitousness in an indictment may be resolved only after findings of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  fact have been completed with the results primarily affecting the punishment that may be imposed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 215.51 of the Penal Law is not unconstitutional on grounds of vagueness. Defendant's refusal to answer questions before the Grand Jury after having been granted immunity was not justifiable because the statute did not spell out what is a legal or proper interrogatory. Subsequent judicial review of the procedures used and screening of the questions posed to a witness are sufficient to assure the integrity of due process.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The questions which defendant refused to answer were relevant to the subject matter of the Grand Jury's investigations.  It is sufficient if the relevancy of the question to the subject matter under investigation is susceptible of intelligent estimate, or even if there is no more than a justifiable suspicion of a relationship between the question asked and the subject matter under investigation.  </SPAN></P>

At the hearing before the Referee, the sole evidence relating to the ratio existing between the assessments and the fair market value of the realty consisted of a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  stipulation between petitioner and respondent town that the percentages marked into the record were the ratios fixed by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment for the years in question for respondent.  However, respondent refused to stipulate to the use or to the correctness of said rates.  There was no proof of any kind by either party to either justify or to disprove the State rate.  While the State equalization rate is a reliable measure of the assessment ratio, it may not be solely relied upon to prove inequality under subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law. More must be done by petitioner to establish the ratio to be used than simply having marked into evidence a certified copy of the State ratio for the year in question as it applied to the municipality. When one seeks to rely upon the State ratio, and that ratio has been denied or has not been stipulated, then that person must justify its use by showing it pertains specifically to the taxing unit and that it is statistically accurate (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Guth Realty v Gingold</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 41 AD2d 479, affd 34 NY2d 440). The party seeking to justify the State rate should furnish evidence to show the various parcels included&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in the sampling by the board of the assessing unit involved and the types of property making up that sampling. The issue of ratio for 1972 to 1974 is remitted to the Referee for a further hearing at which petitioner may attempt to justify the State ratio at the stipulated figures.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since the petition asked that the assessment be reduced to $ 100,000 for each of the years 1971 and 1972, it was improper for the Referee to reduce such assessment for those years to $ 92,960 and $ 87,150.  A petitioner in a tax certiorari proceeding is limited to the relief sought in the application to the board of review and the petition.  </SPAN></P>

The executor filed an account and petition for judicial settlement of decedent's estate. The court, upon its own motion, challenged the propriety and legality of a compromise claim with the Department of Social Services (Department), a preferred creditor. The Department contracted for nursing home care, drugs, medical care, and hospital expenses for decedent and his wife. The court determined that the stipulation of settlement and compromise was based upon false information, was illegal, unauthorized, and resulted in a gift of public money to a private charity in violation of N.Y.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The stipulation of settlement and compromise, in light of the ultimate facts of the account, is based upon false information and error in fact, and is illegal as it results in a gift of a substantial sum of public money to a private charity.  The Department of Social Services' claim against the estate for care for decedent and his wife as a dependent, which was compromised at 50%, was a preferred claim, entitled to be paid before any general creditors or legatees are entitled to be paid.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner former teacher sought review of the decision of the State Education Department (New York), which voted unanimously to sustain both charges of insubordination brought by respondent school board and to terminate the former teacher.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the provisions of N.Y. Educ. Law &sect; 3020-a, charges of insubordination were brought against the former teacher. A three-member hearing panel of the board recommended dismissal of one charge and sustaining the other, the school board, however, upon examining the panel's recommendations, unanimously found the former teacher guilty of insubordination. The former teacher appealed in a N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 proceeding alleging that the decision involved a denial of due process; violated the former teacher's First Amendment rights; and the penalty was out of proportion. On appeal, the court recommended that the matter be returned to the board for further consideration of a penalty. The court annulled the board's determination as to the first charge, and found that dismissal for insubordination sustained in the first charge was excessive. The court reasoned that even if insubordination in respect to the failure to comply with the agreement not to use a certain book was to be found, it would not be sufficient as a basis for a charge, with its possible severe consequences to a tenured teacher.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that dismissal for insubordination sustained in the first charge was excessive.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- teachers -- dismissal of tenured teacher -- school board's unanimous recommendation that petitioner was guilty on first charge of insubordination was not, as matter of law, arbitrary, unreasonable and unsupported by proof submitted -- second finding of insubordination, based on petitioner's reintroduction of book into English curriculum, which book parties had agreed would no longer be used, is annulled; </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">section 3020-a of Education Law</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> is constitutional; hearing provided by school administration omitted essential evidence, required by due process to sustain charge of insubordination, that board ever adopted regulations or produced valid directive for teachers' guidance concerning teaching of this book; efforts to restrict petitioner's use of book, in light of failure to establish acceptable teaching guidelines, were in violation of his right of academic freedom -- under circumstances, penalty of dismissal for insubordination sustained in charge No. 1 is excessive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. After a hearing panel made recommendations as to two charges of insubordination brought against petitioner, a tenured teacher of English, respondent's board of education voted unanimously to sustain&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  both charges and to terminate petitioner.  The specification in the first charge of insubordination was that petitioner left without consent and without just cause a private conference regarding his teaching procedures, called by his school principal. Although the finding of a majority of the hearing panel was that no insubordination as charged could be determined, the school board's unanimous recommendation that petitioner was guilty of insubordination was not, as a matter of law, arbitrary, unreasonable and unsupported by proof submitted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The second charge of insubordination, which a majority of the panel sustained, was based upon petitioner's alleged use, with parental objections and without knowledge and consent of the school administration, of Catcher in the Rye, a book which the parties had previously agreed would no longer be used in the English curriculum. Section 3020-a of the Education Law, providing for hearing procedures and penalties, is constitutional.  However, the hearing provided by the school administration omitted essential evidence, necessary to properly present and sustain a charge of insubordination, that the board ever adopted regulations or produced a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  valid directive for teachers' guidance concerning the teaching of Catcher in the Rye.  The ad hoc agreement between the parties would not necessarily have general application, and accordingly, even if insubordination were found based on noncompliance with the agreement, it would not be sufficient as a basis for a charge and finding of insubordination. Furthermore, the school administration's efforts to restrict petitioner's use of Catcher in the Rye in his high school English class, in light of the fact that there was a lack of careful attention given to substantive as well as procedural due process in establishing acceptable teaching guidelines, were in violation of petitioner's right of academic freedom. Accordingly, the board's determination as to charge No. 2 is annulled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Under the circumstances, the penalty of dismissal for insubordination sustained in charge No. 1 is excessive. The matter should be returned to the board for further consideration of a penalty provided for by statute short of dismissal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating &sect; 14-14 for operating a medical laboratory without a mercantile license and filed a motion to dismiss the information, arguing that the authority to test and license operators of medical laboratories had been impliedly pre-empted by the state under N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 574(1) et seq. Defendant argued that the city's regulation of an area, for purposes similar to that already under control by state statute, was arbitrary and unreasonable and violative of substantive due process. The city argued that its ordinance, unlike the state statute, did not contemplate or provide for testing of laboratory personnel to insure their competence, but rather to regulate and license local businesses to insure compliance with local zoning, building, and fire codes, and to impose licensing fees to offset the cost thereof. The court held that the city's purpose was not similar to that of the state and, thus, did not compel the conclusion that the ordinance was capricious and arbitrary.

The city's regulation of this area has not been pre-empted by the State in the exercise of its police power. Although licensing of laboratory personnel is required by State statute to insure their competence, the purpose of the ordinance, unlike the State statute, is to regulate and license local places of business, including medical laboratories, in order to insure compliance with local zoning, building and fire codes and to impose reasonable licensing fees to offset&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the cost thereof.

The court found that the husband could not attack the statutes as unconstitutional because he had availed himself of the benefits of the statutes.

The court found that although defendants' contentions were framed in terms of a denial of their fundamental right to a speedy trial, the issue specifically before the court was whether one charged with some form of homicide delineated in &sect; 30.30(3)(a) had a &quot;fundamental&quot; right to be tried within six months after the commencement of a criminal action, and whether the statutory exclusion of such offenses from the six-month time period was an abridgement of defendants' U.S. Const. amend. VI right to a speedy trial. The court held that &sect; 30.30(3)(a) was constitutional and did not deny defendants equal protection of the laws.

Section 160.15(4) indicated that a person was guilty of robbery in the first degree if he displayed a firearm in the commission of the crime but that an affirmative defense existed if the firearm was not loaded or not operable. The court agreed that &sect; 160.15(4) was an unconstitutional denial of due process to the extent that it placed the burden on defendant to disprove an essential element of the crime, the operability and loaded condition of the firearm, rather than requiring the prosecution to prove the element beyond a reasonable doubt. The court concluded, however, that since the jury had found that defendant participated in an armed robbery that a verdict of robbery in the second degree was proper rather than requiring a new trial.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff subcontractor brought suit to foreclose a mechanic's lien imposed in spite of its express written waiver of the right to impose such a lien. The general contractor filed a motion for summary judgment. In opposition to the motion, the subcontractor claimed that &sect; 34 of the New York State Lien Law, 1975 N.Y. Laws 74, which secured to subcontractors, such as plaintiff, the right to file a lien, was a remedial statute intended to correct imperfections in the prior law and should be applied retroactively. The subcontractor argued that the lien waiver provision in the contract was thus rendered unenforceable. The court noted that a remedial statute was one designed to correct imperfections or procedural deficiencies in prior law. The court held that &sect; 34 was not a remedial statute because it did not provide a new remedy or change the form of, extend, or augment the pre-existing right to file a mechanic's lien absent a waiver. The court held that the right to waive, springing from a contract right specifically authorized by law, could not be retrospectively denied under the guise that a newly enacted statute was remedial, and granted the motion for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. On February 5, 1973, plaintiff, a subcontractor, entered into a written contract with defendant Beacon Construction, the general contractor, to supply materials and perform work in connection with the construction of a housing project.  The contract contained an express written waiver of plaintiff's right to file or enforce liens, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  expressly permitted modification only by an instrument in writing signed by the party to be charged.  Thereafter plaintiff filed a mechanic's lien notice and instituted a lien foreclosure action. Upon defendant Beacon's motion for summary judgment, the motion is granted.  Contentions by plaintiff that prior to the execution of the contract the beneficial owners of the project orally agreed to delete the lien waiver provision, and that after the execution of the agreement there was an oral executed modification of the written contract, are rejected.  The parol evidence contradicts the terms of the complete written contract and the provisions of the writing may not be contradicted, varied or avoided by the tender of oral evidence; section 15-301 of the General Obligations Law applies and is controlling.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 34 of the Lien Law (L 1975, ch 74, eff July 1, 1975), which provides that any contract or agreement whereby the right to file or enforce any lien created under article 2 of the Lien Law shall be void as against public policy and wholly unenforceable, is not to be given retroactive effect. The section is not a remedial act since it does not provide a new remedy or change&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the form of, extend or augment the existing remedy, for the pre-existing right to file a mechanic's lien has not been altered and remains in effect.  Nor may the impairment of the obligation of the existing contract between the parties be justified under the police power, as there is no clear expression from a reading of the statute that the Legislature intended it to be applied retroactively. The postponement of the effective date of the statute adds additional weight to this conclusion.  </SPAN></P>

Act &sect; 712, which defined a juvenile delinquent in terms of adult criminal conduct. Defendant also contended N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05 denied him equal protection of the law under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant allegedly discharged a five-millimeter air-gun. The discharge struck another, necessitating medical treatment. Defendant stood accused of violating N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 265.05 and 120.20. Defendant contended that since N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act. &sect; 712 defined a juvenile delinquent in terms of adult criminal conduct, any act on the part of a person under 16 not proscribed for an adult (such as possession of an air-gun) could not be the basis of juvenile delinquency. The court disagreed. Although certain confusion was created by the wording of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.05, the confusion could be characterized as an inappropriate placement of the provision, or a decision that placing all provisions relating to weapons in one chapter was appropriate. Such confusion was not a violation of defendant's rights. Defendant's contention that his U.S. Const. amend. XIV rights were violated because &sect; 265.05 did not apply equally to juveniles as to adults was meritless, as was his contention that the statute was vague.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Respondent may properly be charged as a juvenile delinquent for possessing a 5 millimeter air-gun in violation of section 265.05 of the Penal Law. Respondent allegedly discharged said gun striking another boy in the wrist necessitating medical treatment. Section 265.05 which provides that any person under the age of 16 &quot;shall be adjudged a juvenile delinquent&quot; for possessing &quot;any air-gun&quot;, an act which would not be a crime if committed by an adult, is not impermissibly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  inconsistent with subdivision (a) of section 712 of the Family Court Act which defines a &quot;juvenile delinquent&quot; as a &quot;person over seven and less than sixteen years of age who does any act which, if done by an adult, would constitute a crime&quot;.  The confusion caused by the lack of an adequate explanation for singling out possession of an air-gun or spring-gun as the sole noncriminal basis for juvenile delinquency is not such a violation of respondent's rights as to mandate the dismissal of the petition against him.  The Legislature has the right to enact any definition of a juvenile delinquent that it feels is appropriate.  Section 265.05 of the Penal Law should therefore be interpreted as adding the words &quot;or who possesses any air-gun, spring-gun or other instrument or weapon in which the propelling force is a spring or air&quot; at the end of the definition of juvenile delinquent found in section 712 of the Family Court Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The fact that section 265.05 does not apply equally for juveniles and adults alike does not deprive respondent of equal protection of the laws.  Cogent reasons exist for treating adults differently than younger persons of less experience and reasoned judgments.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Monroe County Local Law No. 2 of 1975, to the extent it purports to restrict and regulate the number and maximum size of all gasoline price signs other than the signs required to be affixed to the pumps, is unconstitutional.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Provisions of the New York State Financial Emergency Act for the City of New York freezing the wages&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of employees of respondent Transit Authority and other &quot;covered organizations&quot; (L 1975, ch 868, as amd by L 1975, ch 870), do not unconstitutionally impair contract obligations in violation of section 10 of article I of the United States Constitution.  The existence of &quot;a state of financial emergency&quot; within the city (L 1975, ch 868, &sect; 1) serves as a basis for an exception to the proscription against interference with contract rights. Priority must be given to the public interest over strict compliance with the contract clause.  The respective financial conditions of the State and respondent Transit Authority are dependent upon each other and intertwined to such an extent that the Legislature was justified in including respondent as a &quot;covered organization&quot; in devising an emergency plan to solve the fiscal crisis in the city.  In including the employees of the Transit Authority, represented by petitioner union, the Legislature did not go beyond the scope needed to fulfill the objectives of the Financial Emergency Act, but merely spread the burden over a larger group of public employees. The savings generated by the wage freeze may be used to reduce the financial hardship of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  city.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The wage freeze does not unconstitutionally impair the pension benefits for public employees in violation of section 7 of article V of the State Constitution.  An employee's rate of compensation is the most significant part of the formula for determining retirement allowances. However, the Constitution does not prohibit the diminution of an employee's salary where the formula for computing his pension remains constant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. To avoid an unlawful discrimination, respondent must offer its employees the option of agreeing to a wage increase deferment similar to those previously offered to other unions representing employees covered by the wage freeze. The benefits of such a deferment are that the money lost will eventually be repaid and that for pension purposes the increases are included in the base salary. </SPAN></P>

In addition, many prohibited items are now easily available to the public on Sunday by means of vending machines, many of which are maintained by the State along the New York Thruway.  The penalty provision of article 12 was designed for a simpler time when merchandising was done in small shops or by peddlers and did not contemplate the forfeiture of goods valued at many thousands of dollars.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Section 438 of the Family Court Act which provides for awarding counsel fees only against the husband in a support proceeding is an overbroad generalization based on sex, a suspect classification, which is in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  Section 438 and its predecessors have their tracings in the common law wherein a husband was liable for his wife's necessaries.  These statutes were all based on the outmoded concept that the husband was the sole &quot;breadwinner&quot; of the family and that his wife was an economically nonproductive person.  Statistics compiled by the Department&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of Labor indicate that in October, 1974, 54.2% of all women between 18 and 64 years of age were in the labor force (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Taylor v Louisiana</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 419 U.S. 522, 535, n 17). The presumption can no longer be made that wives are completely dependent upon their husbands for support (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Frontiero v Richardson</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 411 U.S. 677). It is more and more common that fathers are awarded custody of their children.  As such, they would have the uncontroverted right to bring an action for the children's support against the mother who would be secondarily liable for her children's support.  However, as it is currently drafted, section 438 would not entitle the father to an award of counsel fees.  </SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 153, provided for a plan of registration of voters by mail. N.Y. Const. art. II, &sect; 5, specifically stated that voters in cities and villages having 5,000 inhabitants or more were to be registered upon personal application only. The court held that N.Y. Elec. Law &sect; 153 was unconstitutional. The constitutional language was unmistakably clear that the phrase &quot;upon personal application only&quot; could only be interpreted to require registration in person. The legislature could not legislate in direct violation of the unmistakable meaning of the New York State Constitution. If the legislature wanted to change the method of voter registration, it should have followed the procedure set forth by passing legislation in two successive legislative sessions and then submitted that legislation to the voters as a constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, a bicycle company and others, instituted an action for a declaratory judgment concerning a regulation promulgated by defendants, the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles of the State of New York and others, dealing with bicycle visibility. Before the court were three motions in connection with that action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">&nbsp;N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf.

Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 15, &sect; 59.4(g) provided, in part, that reflective materials had to be mounted on the tires, rims, or spokes of bicycles. A new and different tire reflector was developed, and the bicycle company asked to have the regulation amended to include the new device. The Commissioner refused. The court held that N.Y. Veh. &amp; Traf. Law &sect; 1236(d) was constitutional. The statute was entitled to a presumption of constitutionality. There was a limited field of discretion to the Commissioner and an implied requirement that the Commissioner act reasonably.  N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 15, &sect; 59.4(g) was valid and did not violate the Commerce Clause because it was only a slight indirect effect on interstate commerce, and there was no federal preemption. Last, the Commissioner had not acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner where the reflectorized tire was an adequate means to provide visibility; that is, the Commissioner did not fail to carry out the legislative mandate.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to the enabling legislation ( Vehicle and Traffic Law, &sect; 1236, subd [d]), respondent Commissioner of Motor Vehicles lawfully promulgated regulations requiring bicycles to &quot;be equipped with a continuous circular band of reflective material mounted on the tires, rims or spokes&quot; ( 15 NYCRR 59.4 [g]).  Subdivision (d) of section 1236, which required&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  respondent commissioner to &quot;promulgate rules and regulations, after public hearing, in relation to the visibility of bicycles from all directions&quot;, is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to an administrative agency. The Legislature has made a policy determination that as a matter of public safety, bicycles should be visible from all directions.  The requirement that respondent commissioner act in a reasonable manner in implementing that policy is implied in the legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The regulation concerning side visibility of bicycles does not violate the commerce clause of the United States Constitution.  In promoting its legitimate interest in protecting the users of bicycles within the boundaries, New York may adopt a regulation that indirectly affects interstate commerce, absent Federal pre-emption, unless the effect of the law as a safety measure is so slight or problematical as not to outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from interference which seriously impedes it.  The increase in cost and physical inconvenience caused by the use in New York of the reflectorized tire rather than the less expensive wide-angle reflex reflector, which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  attaches to the spokes of the bicycle tire, does not so severely impede the free flow of interstate commerce so as to render the regulation unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Respondent commissioner did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner when he refused to amend the regulation to permit the use of the wide-angle reflex reflector as an alternate method of side visibility. A bicycle equipped with a wide-angle reflex reflector when stationary would not necessarily produce visual identification to an oncoming motorist, whereas the continuous circular band would produce such visual identification. </SPAN></P>

The court denied the commissioner's motion to dismiss as to recipient one but granted the motion as to recipient two. The court noted that N.Y. Comp.

The determination as to recipient one was made prior to the amendment and the section was not complied with. Recipient two's application for a grant was made after the section was amended, and, therefore, there was no requirement for the commissioner to consider the items under the social services law.

The court vacated defendant's conviction, adjudicated defendant as a youthful offender, and sentenced defendant to probation. The court found no rational basis for Rule 720.10 (2)(a) because it permitted youthful offender adjudication to be considered for A-III youths and was significantly disparate as compared to minimum sentences of imprisonment that was mandated for the A-II and A-I youth. The court held that the legislative memorandum was void for vagueness because it did not state the relevant purpose for the selection of A-III youths only and did not specify any articulable basis for its determination and classification. The court held that there was no reasonable ground for using an accusation as the determining factor in the imposition of sentence because sentencing was based upon convictions, not accusations, and that the restriction failed to meet due process because it tied the availability of youthful offender treatment to the indictment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Defendant, a 17-year-old female, indicted for the crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the first degree, a class A-I felony, who pleaded guilty to the reduced charge of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, a class A-III felony, is adjudicated a youthful offender. CPL 720.10 (subd 2, par [a], as amd by L 1975, ch 832, eff Aug. 9, 1975), which permits youthful&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  offender treatment to only those persons indicted for an A-III felony while prohibiting such treatment for persons indicted for A-I or A-II felonies, is arbitrary and capricious and therefore unconstitutional.  There is no &quot;rational basis&quot; to distinguish A-III youthful felons from A-I and A-II youthful felons. All A felonies are identical in that they all impose maximum life sentences. All youths facing such a mandatory life sentence should be afforded the same discretion for consideration of leniency.  In addition, there is no reasonable ground for using the accusatory instrument rather than the actual conviction as the determining factor in the imposition of sentence. &quot;By tying the availability of youthful offender treatment to the indictment, without regard to whether the class A felony charge is sustained by a verdict is to give constitutionally impermissible significance to the ex parte Grand Jury accusation&quot; (see </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">People v Brian R</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">., 78 Misc 2d 616, affd 47 AD2d 599). The weight difference between an A-I sale indictment and A-III sale indictment of 7/8 of an ounce of a controlled substance creates unduly harsh penalties for the small-scale youthful pusher in light of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  great disparity in penalties.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A sentence of probation may properly be imposed on an A-III adjudicated youthful offender. The advantages of probation over incarceration lie in the broader range of rehabilitative alternatives and resources available outside prison.  Defendant is in need of community supervision and guidance which only probation can offer.  She is an &quot;immature youth&quot; who needs assistance; she must be taught to effectively function as a useful member of society.  </SPAN></P>

Proof by the People that an inoperable, unloaded, or imitation pistol was utilized sufficed for a second degree robbery conviction. The pistol had to be loaded and operable to sustain a first degree robbery conviction. By imposing upon defendant the duty of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the weapon was unloaded or inoperable, the statute relieved the prosecution of proving that element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. This requirement offended due process and, accordingly, was unconstitutional. The punishments for the two different degrees of robbery varied greatly. However, dismissal of the robbery charge was unnecessary because the appropriate remedy was to change the wording in N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 160.15, subd. 4 from &quot;it is an affirmative defense&quot; to &quot;it is a defense.&quot; Thus, at trial the People would be required to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the firearm displayed was loaded and operable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a medical malpractice claim filed by plaintiffs, a patient and her husband, the jury returned a verdict in their favor against defendant doctor. At the trial's conclusion, the doctor filed a motion to set the verdict aside, raising a constitutional challenge to N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 148-a(8) (effective July 1, 1975), which permitted a medical malpractice panel report to be admitted into evidence. The court denied the motion and issued its opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs alleged that the doctor departed from accepted medical practices and failed to make a proper diagnosis of cancer and that the grave effects of the disease could have been avoided with early detection and timely treatment. Pursuant to new legislation, the matter was presented to a medical malpractice panel, which returned a finding of liability. During the trial, plaintiffs offered the panel's written finding into evidence, which finding was admitted over the doctor's objection and was the subject of his motion to vacate the judgment rendered against him. The court first held that &sect; 148-a(8) was consistent with the New York State and Federal Constitutions, and, accordingly, the court's duty was to obey its mandate. The substantive right of the parties was not removed by &sect; 148-a(8) because it did not deprive a litigant of a right or interest protected by the Due Process Clause. Second, there was some reasonable connection between it and the promotion of the health, comfort, safety and welfare of society. Third, the legislature had a reasonable basis for its enactment.

Subdivision 8 of section 148-a of the Judiciary Law, authorizing the establishment of a medical malpractice panel whose unanimous recommendation as to liability or lack of it is admissible into evidence at any subsequent trial for the consideration of the jury, is constitutional.  The statute, which removes no substantive right of the parties in a medical malpractice case, does not deprive the litigant of any right or interest protected by due process. Since there is a reasonable connection between the statute and the promotion of the health, comfort, safety and welfare of society, the need for and desirability of the law has been shown.  Furthermore, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in concluding that necessity and the public interest mandated action during a critical period, the Legislature had a reasonable basis for the statute's enactment and was free to experiment and to innovate.</SPAN></P>

Either party may call as a witness a panel member so as to further examine and cross-examine into the panel's findings.  The statutory requirement that the recommendation shall not be binding on the jury but shall be accorded such weight as the jury chooses to ascribe to it, along with proper instructions by the court, insures that the jurors' prerogatives are not contaminated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The statutory scheme forbidding robbery with display of what appears to be a firearm (Penal Law, &sect;&sect; 160.15, 160.10) does not deny due process of law by creating a presumption which requires a defendant to disprove the degree of culpability. Pursuant to section 160.15 of the Penal Law (robbery in the first degree), it is an affirmative defense that the gun of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  which the defendant was in possession at the time of the robbery was either unloaded or incapable of being fired.  If successful, he could still be convicted of robbery in the second degree (Penal Law, &sect; 160.10).  In striking down a Maine statute which blended the two culpably differing offenses of murder and manslaughter and which shifted the burden of proving intent to the defendant </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mullaney v Wilbur</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 421 U.S. 684), the Supreme Court did not intend to strike down all affirmative defenses.  In the New York statutory scheme, contrary to the Maine law in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mullaney</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the defendant has no presumption to overcome in establishing the affirmative defense. The prosecution has not been relieved of any of its burden of proof and must still show guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, unaided by presumption.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Mullaney</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> does not require that the prosecution establish the facts which distinguish between the degrees of robbery by display of what appears to be a firearm. The statutes defining the degrees of robbery have not defined all robberies as a single offense and then required all defendants to disprove the elements of aggravation.  The statutory scheme goes no further than isolating&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  those defendants who claim inability to complete the assault by facts only within their own peculiar knowledge.  There has been no general redefinition of the law of robbery in New York and the reductive factor does not extend to proving or disproving any element of the crime.  Where there are manifest disparities in convenience of proof, such a burden may be imposed without deprivation of due process.  </SPAN></P>

Furthermore, although a driver's license is a valuable right, it can be constitutionally taken without a hearing.  The procedure for giving notice specified in the statute is reasonable.

The tenants argued, among other things, that it constituted a denial of due process and equal protection, both in its inception and in its administration. The thrust of the tenants' contention was that the tenants were not afforded the right to protest, examine, or question the fuel pass-along prior to the increase. The Administrator filed a motion to dismiss the action, which the court granted. The presumption of constitutionality was strong and the party asserting the challenge had prove invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt. The court found that the tenants actually had two procedures for challenging the increase. Albeit, there was no property right in rent.

The State, as a reasonable exercise of its police power, constitutionally enacted the statute in question even though it had the effect of negating vested contractual rights because there was no question that the statute was reasonably related to accomplish the legitimate objectives of the legislature.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a complaint against defendant. Plaintiff's verified bill of particulars showed medical charges for the cervical sprain and the permanent partial disability involved. However, defendant filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff's complaint for failure to comply with minimum statutory and pleading requirements required by N.Y. Ins. Law &sect; 671. The court disagreed with the appellate division's recent holding on the issue and found that the physical therapy treatments should not be stricken from the minimal threshold calculations as a matter of law, but should be reserved for a trier of such facts. The court found that physical therapy as well as occupational and psychiatric therapy fell squarely within the ambit of medical expenses. However, the court found that plaintiff's complaint was defective because it did not contain any specific averment of serious injury.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The reasonable and customary charges for physical therapy treatments should not be excluded as a matter of law in computing the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  $ 500 threshold necessary to meet the test of &quot;serious injury&quot; found in the no-fault automobile insurance law (Insurance Law, &sect; 671, subd 4, par [b]).  The trier of facts should determine the necessity, applicability and reasonable cost of the particular physical therapy prescribed and administered for the particular injury involved.  This is so despite an Appellate Division, Fourth Department opinion to the contrary </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">( </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Colenzo v Kerman</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, 49 AD2d 809). The contention that the Legislature, by omitting &quot;psychiatric, physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation&quot; expenses (&sect; 671, subd 1, par [a], cl [ii]) from the definition of &quot;serious injury&quot; (&sect; 671, subd 4, par [b]), meant to exclude physical therapy treatments, is not persuasive.  One subdivision is entirely different from the other and the two cannot be compared; section 671 (subd 4, par [b]) is to stand on its own and be interpreted as such.  To hold that physical therapy is not among the categories of services includable in the $ 500 threshold is contrary to the dictionary or practical definition of medical services and flies in the face of &quot;medical expense&quot; as defined in 11 NYCRR 65.1(d)(2).  Further, the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  primary purpose of the Legislature was to afford maximum, rapid payment of first-party benefits without regard to fault. If it felt impelled to draft a law that would serve to impede more plaintiffs from bringing suit for &quot;pain and suffering&quot;, it could have accomplished that by raising the threshold amount.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although plaintiff in this case raised an issue of whether there is &quot;serious injury&quot; by virtue of a permanent partial disability, which, apart from any determination as to the applicability of physical therapy in attaining the statutory prescribed threshold, would normally deny a motion to dismiss, the motion to dismiss is granted.  The complaint contains no specific averment of &quot;serious injury&quot; ( CPLR 3016, subd [g]).  However, plaintiff is granted leave to serve an amended complaint in proper order.  </SPAN></P>

The court granted the employees declaratory judgment and permanently enjoined the state from enforcing the order. The court denied the state's cross-motion for summary judgment. The executive order made no distinction between the duties and functions of the employees involved.

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Executive Order No. 10 (9 NYCRR 3.10) provided, essentially, that all State employees in noncompetitive classes within the Executive Department or within a department the head of which was appointed by the Governor, and who earned $ 30,000 per year, would file a sworn statement of their assets and liabilities, which would be available for public disclosure.

While the mandatory filing of financial statements is in certain instances an appropriate safeguard against conflicts of interest, the sweeping language of the order applying to everyone earning $ 30,000 or more regardless of the nature of their specific duties in a noncompetitive or nonclassified position is unreasonable and an unnecessary invasion of the constitutional right of privacy of those individuals not involved in administrative or policy making processes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A young, two-year-old girl suffered from a seizure that left her brain damaged. At 23 years of age, she held an I.Q. of 62 and functioned at a six or seven-year-old age level. She did not know the difference between a man and a woman, but had a great proclivity for encounters with males. Both the family and court appointed psychiatrists both testified that sterilization would be the best treatment for her because pregnancy would most probably result in a psychotic reaction. The court ordered the sterilization. The court held that the decision to authorize compulsory medical treatment for an individual was subject to a variety of factors and was an extremely difficult decision to make. The court reasoned that the rationale of parens patriae was that the state must intervene in order to protect an individual who was not able to make decisions in his own best interest. The court concluded that the decision to exercise the power of parens patriae must reflect the welfare of society, as a whole, but mainly it must balance the individual's right to be free from interference against the individual's need to be treated, if treatment would in fact be in her best interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's first trial ended in a mistrial when the jury failed to reach a verdict. In defendant's new trial, he sought to prohibit the State from reprosecuting him under two counts of the indictment that the first trial court had declined to submit to the jury, and two other counts, which the trial court had dismissed upon the basis of legally insufficient trial evidence. The court found the basic issue was whether the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment could be harmonized with state legislative enactments which put a court order, which required an evaluation of trial evidence and a determination that such evidence was too thin to support a conviction, and which had the force of acquittal, on a par with routine trial rulings and permitted that order to be aborted when a jury disagreement over unrelated matters led to a mistrial and direction for a new trial. The court answered the question in the negative. The court held that unsubmitted counts did not rise to the same level as dismissed counts because a refusal to submit rested upon factors unrelated to the standard of proof for conviction.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant owners of real property filed a motion for partial summary judgment dismissing the first cause of action in plaintiff lienor's action for the foreclosure of certain mechanic's liens and other relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lienor brought an action seeking to foreclose on certain mechanic's liens as well as for other relief against the property owners. The owners filed a motion seeking partial summary judgment, which was denied by the court. The court held that there was no violation of the due process clause, nor of any constitutional rights under U.S. Const. amend. XIV, because a mechanic's lien could be acquired by filing notice thereof without any prior approval. The court noted that the lienor was merely seeking to create the interest of the lien, and in order to enforce such rights thereunder, a full plenary trial was required, thereby protecting due process rights of the property owners. The court held that the owners failed to meet their burden of showing that the mechanic's lien statute was unconstitutional. The court further held that it was a question of fact as to whether the lienor was a &quot;contractor&quot; and whether the entire sum claimed under the liens was for work not subject to claim by lien, such as procurement of bids and negotiation of contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the property owners' motion for partial summary judgment dismissing the lienor's claim under a mechanic's lien.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Liens -- mechanics' liens -- filing of mechanic's lien without prior judicial determination is constitutional; there is no seizure of property as to require compliance with standards of due process -- defendants are not entitled to partial summary judgment on issue of whether plaintiff is valid lienor; issues of fact exist as to whether plaintiff is contractor, as to whether entire sum claimed due is for supervisory work or in part for nonlienable work, and as to whether plaintiff participated as joint venturer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The creation of an interest in real property by the filing of a mechanic's lien without any prior judicial determination does not constitute such a seizure of property as to require compliance with the standards of due process set forth in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.  While a mechanic's lien creates an interest in realty, it is not an estate therein and the title, use and possession, including the right to alienate, remains with the owner.  Court approval is required before the owner's use and possession can be materially affected.  Furthermore, a mechanic's lien involves the creation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a security interest rather than the prejudgment seizure of property in enforcement thereof.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Defendants are not entitled to partial summary judgment on the issue of whether plaintiff is a valid lienor. Subdivision 9 of section 2 of the Lien Law, which provides that a contractor is one who contracts with an owner of real property for improvements, should be restricted to one who would be so characterized in common speech. The determination should be based on all the facts constituting the relationship.  From the evidence presented, it cannot be said as a matter of law whether plaintiff is a contractor since plaintiff's responsibility relative to subcontractors and materialmen was to procure bids, but the contracts were entered into by the owner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Even if plaintiff is not a contractor, he may still be a party entitled to file a lien.  In addition to contractors, anyone who provides services in the improvement of real property may be entitled to a lien.  Plaintiff's supervisory duties is work which may form the basis of a lien.  However, procurement of bids and negotiation of contracts with subcontractors cannot provide the basis of a lien separate from the work of a contractor. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Therefore, since the sole basis of plaintiff's liens is supervision, there are issues of fact present as to whether the entire sum claimed due is for that work or, in part, for other nonlienable work.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. An issue of fact also exists as to whether plaintiff participated as a joint venturer with defendants in the supervision of certain work done for defendants' tenants. Although the contract called for a division of fees, plaintiff had no obligation relative to expenses.  </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 130.35 of the Penal Law, which singles out males as perpetrators of the crime of rape in the first degree, and specifies females as victims, is constitutional.  Different classes of persons may be treated in different ways without a denial of due process as long as the classification is reasonable.  Since only males can physiologically perpetrate the crime of rape, the limitation of culpability to males constitutes a rational classification directly related to the objective of the criminal penalty, the protection of females from rape. Furthermore, a female may be guilty of rape in the first degree as an aider and abettor to the male perpetrator of the crime, and it is no defense that she is legally incapable of perpetrating the crime.  Accordingly, since the classification is not unreasonable or irrational, the sex classification within the statute does not deny equal protection of the law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  Section 130.50 of the Penal Law, which provides that a person is guilty of sodomy when he engages in deviate sexual intercourse, is constitutional.  Any person, male or female, may be found guilty of sodomy and the reference in the statute to the male gender &quot;he&quot; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  does not limit culpability to males. However, even if the sodomy statutes were to be construed so that only males could be perpetrators, this would not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution since the sex classification is reasonable and bears a fair and substantial relationship to the object of the law by attempting to protect the well-being of females. Accordingly, the statute does not deny equal protection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Defendant's request for a bill of particulars listing the nature of the deviate sexual intercourse charged is denied.  The information is evidentiary and must be proved as part of the People's case.  Furthermore, defendant has not shown the information to be necessary to prepare his defense.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Defendant's request for an order directing the District Attorney to disclose for discovery the number of persons present in the Grand Jury room during the presentation of the evidence, the number of Grand Jurors present and the number who voted for, against or who abstained from voting on the indictment, as well as whether any unauthorized persons were present in the room, is denied.  Defendant has failed to claim any irregularities and in effect seeks a fishing&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  expedition.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The motion for a hearing to determine whether any of the identification procedures used violated any of defendant's statutory or constitutional rights is granted.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">With exceptions, &sect; 27(a) prevented the idling of a vehicle for longer than three minutes so as to control pollution. Defendant claimed that the county lacked the authority to pass the regulation. The court ruled for defendant and struck the regulation as unconstitutional. Despite pollution's grave harm to individuals, &sect; 27(a) unreasonably restricted people's right to travel and was overly burdensome in violation of the Due Process Clause. The court also noted that the prevention of the idling of a vehicle had a de minimus effect on pollution. As a result, &sect; 27(a) was unreasonable because it could not have been significantly related to its intended purpose to reduce pollution. Therefore, it was an unreasonable exercise of police power, which was a violation of the Due Process Clause. Because there was an arbitrary selection of exceptions to &sect; 27(a), it violated the Equal Protection Clause. The county had the power to pass &sect; 27(a) because it was not inconsistent with state law. The search to determine that defendant's vehicle idled longer than three minutes was proper because of the open fields exception to the Fourth Amendment where the vehicle was outside in an open lot.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional law -- idling motor vehicle for longer than three minutes -- article 10 (&sect; 27, subd [a]) of Suffolk County Sanitary Code, which made it unlawful to permit engine of motor vehicle to idle for longer than three consecutive minutes while parking, standing or stopping, with certain enumerated exceptions, is </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">unconstitutional;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> although county department of health was authorized to establish this type of violation, equal protection violated since exceptions grant arbitrary preferences which result in unjust discrimination against individuals and groups -- due process also violated since three-minute limitation on engine idling is not reasonably related to its intended purpose of combating air pollution -- entry of inspector into outdoor lot where buses were parked was not unlawful search; nor can inference be drawn from defendant's failure to produce any witnesses.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Article 10 (&sect; 27, subd [a]) of the Suffolk County Sanitary Code made it unlawful to permit the engine of a motor vehicle, other than a legally authorized emergency vehicle, to idle for longer than three consecutive minutes while parking, standing or stopping.  Exceptions were allowed when a vehicle&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  was motionless because of traffic conditions over which the operator had no control, where regulations required a specific temperature for passenger comfort, and when necessary for operation of mobile telephones, receiving and transmitting stations.  Although the Suffolk County Department of Health was authorized to establish this type of violation in the Sanitary Code, the statute is unconstitutional.  Section 27 is unreasonable and totally unenforceable under the equal protection clause. The exceptions grant arbitrary preferences which result in unjust discrimination against individuals and groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The statute also violates due process.  The three-minute limitation on engine idling zeroes in upon a miniscule source of air emissions and therefore is an unreasonable exercise of police power because it is not reasonably or significantly or effectively related to its intended purpose of combating air pollution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The entry of an inspector into an outdoor lot where buses were parked did not result in an unlawful search. He had reasonable grounds to assume a bus was idling in violation of the law, and the situation can also be considered to come within the &quot;Open Fields&quot; exceptions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the Fourth Amendment.  Nor does the failure of defendant to present a witness cause an inference to arise that the witness may have produced evidence harmful to defendant.  Defendant had the right to remain silent and not present any witnesses, and the People had to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  </SPAN></P>

Despite the threat, the witness testified for the prosecution. Defendant was then charged by information with tampering with the witness. Defendant's motion to dismiss the information was denied. Section 215.10 was not vague and was a reasonable restriction upon individuals for the public good. Section 215.10 specifically defined the conduct it prohibited, and a reasonable man was informed of the nature of the offense prohibited. Further, reasonable cause existed to support the finding that defendant tampered with a witness in violation of &sect; 215.10.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant State Tax Commission made tax assessments against plaintiff exporter of cigarettes, liquor, and other items. The exporter filed an action against the commission seeking a declaration that the assessments were unconstitutional and void under the commerce, import-export, and supremacy clauses of the United States Constitution and pertinent statutes and regulations. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The exporters had a warehouse in New York and sold liquor and cigarettes duty free to people traveling into Canada. The goods were sold for export only. The commission assessed taxes on those sales because the sale and delivery occurred in the state. There was no claim that the exporters violated any of the prescribed state or federal laws or regulations in conducting their business. The state's purpose in assessing the taxes was not to regulate or control the passage of alcoholic beverages within or through the state to prevent unlawful diversion, but rather to raise revenue. Such state action was not constitutionally permissible. The exporters followed the precise procedure prescribed by the federal government for selling merchandise for export. On that basis, federal governmental entities had exempted merchandise sold by the exporters from federal taxes or duty. The exporters' claimed that that determination was controlling on the state, thereby precluding the imposition of state taxes on the liquor. No incident occurred in New York that was subject to the excise tax sought to be imposed. Therefore, the state was precluded from imposing the alcoholic beverage tax in issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the assessment of alcoholic beverage, cigarettes, and sales taxes upon the exporters' merchandise by the commission was unconstitutional and invalid.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c9"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiffs sell cigarettes, liquor and other items for export at locations within the United States to persons crossing the border into Canada.  Persons who wish to buy duty free merchandise enter plaintiffs' offices and receive a receipt which is then given to a customs official at a warehouse, also located within the United States.  When the goods are turned over, the customer is required to proceed directly into Canada.  The businesses&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  operate pursuant to Federal regulations and under permits issued by the Federal Government.  All of the merchandise is produced or originates outside New York State and is packaged and marked solely for the Canadian market.  The assessment of alcoholic beverage, cigarette and sales taxes upon plaintiffs' merchandise by the New York State Tax Commission is unconstitutional and invalid.  Where bonded liquor is sold and delivered under Federal regulation and supervision and segregated from the common mass of goods in this country with the intention of uniting such liquor to the mass of goods belonging to some foreign country, the liquor is not subject to State taxes.  No incident occurs in New York which is subject to the excise tax sought to be imposed.  To permit State regulation except where clearly designed to prevent diversion or use within the State would violate the commerce, import-export and supremacy clauses of the United States Constitution.
