</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee was ordered to pay child support by a court in the state of Washington. After the order was entered, an enforcement order was sought pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-17-606. Appellee defended the action, arguing that the statute was unconstitutional and asserted several more affirmative defenses. The trial court found the statute allowing enforcement of the out-of-state judgment was unconstitutional and appellants challenged the ruling. On appeal, the court held that the statute was constitutional, because the statute afforded appellee the chance for notice and hearing. The court went on, however, to affirm the trial court ruling stating that appellee was not clearly advised of his rights, because a packet appellee received did not adequately explain appellee's rights and duties under the statute. Consequently, the judgment finding the statute unconstitutional was reversed, but the order allowing another hearing for appellee on the child support issue was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant pled guilty to first-degree sexual abuse and was placed on probation. While appellant was still serving his probation period, the legislature passed the Sex and Child Offender Registration Act of 1997 (Act), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 12-12-901 et seq. (1997), which required community notification and made the Act apply to anyone who had been adjudicated of a prescribed sexual offence and was still serving a sentence of probation at the time of the Act's effective date. Appellant challenged the retroactive application of the Act to his earlier conviction. On appeal, the court affirmed the trial courts upholding of the Act since it was not punitive in nature and did not violate the ex post facto or due process provisions of the United States or Arkansas Constitutions. If a law is regulatory, or civil in nature, it cannot be an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty by a jury of rape and was sentenced to twenty years in prison. Appellant's wife prepared and filed a notice of appeal on appellant's behalf. However, the notice was returned to appellant because it was not filed by a licensed attorney or by appellant. Appellant filed a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 37, which was dismissed as untimely. Appellant then filed a motion for reconsideration, which was also denied. On appeal, the state supreme court affirmed denial of appellant's petition and motion, reasoning appellant's appeal was untimely and there was no appeal from appellant's judgment of conviction, as the appeal filed by his wife was never accepted. The state supreme court further determined because judgment was rendered in the case under rule 37, the trial court, as well as the state supreme court, lacked jurisdiction to address appellant's motion for reconsideration.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of trial court was affirmed because the appeal submitted by appellant's wife was invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a state finance administration and its director, supported a newly enacted bill, Arkansas Act 916 of 1995 (Act), which revamped the state's school funding formula by imposing an income-tax surcharge on the tax liability of each individual resident of each local school district not levying a base millage of at least twenty-five mills. Appellee taxpayers sued appellants and claimed the Act violated the state constitution. The trial court granted judgment in favor of appellees. On appeal, the court affirmed reasoning the trial court did not commit reversible error in holding that Act 916 was unconstitutional because it violated the provisions of Ark. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted for rape and sexual solicitation of a child. Pursuant to a plea agreement, appellant agreed to a partial suspension of his prison sentence in exchange for submitting to castration. Appellant American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion to intervene on defendant's behalf, claiming the castration sentence was illegal. The trial court denied appellant's motion because it determined appellant did not have standing. On appeal, the state supreme court affirmed, reasoning appellant failed to meet the requirements for next-friend status, and thus had no standing. The state supreme court declined to relax the standing requirements due to the fact that castration did not involve the unique and irreversible death penalty. The state supreme court further refused to exercise its authority of superintending control granted by Ark. Const. art. VII, &sect; 4, because the provision was not to be used to reach the merits of the case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the trial court affirmed, because appellant lacked standing to intervene on defendant's behalf because it did not qualify for next-friend standing and because the state constitution was not broad enough to give appellant the right to intervene in the merits of a criminal case against another person.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. He appealed the trial court's denial of his petition for Ark R. Crim P. 37 (Rule 37) relief alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. Appellant contended that allowing testimony under the state's victim-impact statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-602(4), violated the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws because the law became effective after he committed the crime. The appellate court refused to allow the constitutional claim because the issue was not litigated in the Rule 37 pleadings or hearing below. Appellant also asserted that counsel was ineffective for failing to seek a mental evaluation prior to trial and for failing to introduce a purported mitigating circumstance. The appellate court held appellant did not establish that counsel's decisions constituted ineffective assistance and there was no reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different had counsel introduced the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted after a bench trial of attempted kidnapping. He was sentenced to 25 years. The court of appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence. Appellant subsequently filed a petition for rehearing, which was denied. After that denial, appellant petitioned for post-conviction relief pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 37. After a hearing, the trial court denied appellant's petition. Appellant sought review of the trial court's denial, arguing that he was denied due process of law because the trial court considered testimony during the sentencing phase concerning uncharged conduct that was remote in time. Appellant also argued that the trial court erred in failing to find counsel ineffective. The court affirmed, holding that the Arkansas Sentencing Guidelines made permissible the trial court's consideration of aggravating factors in appellant's sentencing phase. Moreover, the court held that appellant had not established the two-part test of ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corporations sued appellant state commissioner of revenues and individual directors of the state rice research and promotion board (board). The suit alleged that Act 344 of 1995 (Act 344), the Arkansas Research and Promotion Act, codified at Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 2-20-511 (Repl. 1996), was an illegal delegation of the taxing power that violated Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 23, and art. 16, &sect; 13. Intervenor corporations joined on behalf of appellants. Parties moved for summary judgment. Appellants and intervenors sought review of the grant of summary judgment in favor of appellees, claiming the delegation in Act 344 was constitutional. Act 344 authorized the board to refer to the rice producers of the state the issue of authorizing an assessment against both rice buyers and rice producers. Only rice producers were allowed to vote to impose the assessments. Act 344 directed rice buyers to pay an assessment, without specifying any standards or factors that anyone had to consider before imposing the assessment. It did not afford buyers any notice, hearing, or review before such an assessment was imposed. Act 344 was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. Affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appellees, seven individuals, challenged Ark.

The appellees also sought an injunction preventing enforcement of the statute. The appellants, the Attorney General and the Prosecuting Attorney of the Sixth Judicial District of Arkansas, filed a motion to dismiss that asserted that they were immune from suit and that the chancery court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appellees' claims. The appellants alleged five points of error by the lower court. The court addressed only the issue of lack of jurisdiction by the chancery court. The court found that since the statute in question was a criminal statute, criminal matters were the exclusive province of the circuit court, not the chancery court. The court therefore found the lower court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appellees' claims and reversed the lower court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of capital felony murder. Appellant's direct appeal was affirmed. The trial court denied his subsequent petition for post-conviction relief under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37. The appellate court affirmed. Appellant claimed the trial court committed fundamental error when it refused to include an instruction on robbery as a lesser-included offense of capital felony murder. However, appellant failed to raise this issue on direct appeal. The appellate court ruled that the right to a single lesser-included offense instruction was a fundamental right, but appellant was precluded from assigning error to the denial of that instruction for the first time in a proceeding under Ark. R. Crim. P. 37. Furthermore, trial counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to seek to have the jury instructed on aggravated robbery or for not arguing more vigorously for the submission of the robbery instruction. Likewise, appellate counsel was not ineffective for omitting the denial of the instruction from the assignments of error argued in the direct appeal.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 26-57-904 (Repl. 1997) (Act), which levied a tax on distributors, manufacturers, and wholesale dealers of soft drinks and soft drink syrup. Appellant sued and argued that the Act violated the equal protection clause of the state and federal constitutions because there was no rational basis for taxing soft-drink syrup at a different rate than bottled soft drinks. The trial court granted the appellee state's motion to dismiss and found that appellant lacked standing. The appellant sought review and argued that it had standing under Ark Const. art. 16, &sect; 13 to challenge the constitutionally of the tax. The court agreed and reversed. The court found that the trial court erred because under the plain language of Ark Const. art. 16, &sect; 13, any interested citizen had standing to bring an illegal exaction case and because corporations were citizens for the purposes of challenging the constitutionality of an act.</SPAN></P>

Seeking further review, appellant claimed the statute was unconstitutional, the decision was not supported by substantial evidence, and the decision was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. On review, the supreme court found that appellant was not registered or licensed as an architect and that he prepared construction documents. Because the issue was not properly developed before appellee, the supreme court did not review the question of whether Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 17-14-203 was unconstitutionally broad.

Appellant filed petitions for a declaratory judgment and a writ of mandamus in the lower court, asserting that he was entitled to &quot;extra good time&quot; that had accrued since its repeal. He requested that the lower court compel the Department of Corrections to apply this credit toward his release date. The lower court denied his petition. On review, appellant contended that the retroactive application of the acts repealing &quot;extra good time&quot; violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10. The court affirmed, holding that the Ex Post Facto Clause did not prohibit the retroactive application of a measure that disadvantaged an accused by denying him only the opportunity to reduce his sentence.

Appellant then shot the girlfriend's 15-month-old son. Appellant was sentenced to death for the murders. The death sentence was reversed, and appellant was again sentenced to death. On appeal from the second sentence, appellant asserted that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-603(a), the death sentence statute, was not constitutional. The court disagreed and explained that the jury did not have to impose the death penalty under &sect; 5-4-603(a). The jury could show mercy to a defendant by simply finding that the aggravating circumstances, even though they existed and outweighed the mitigating circumstances, did not justify imposition of the death sentence. There was nothing unconstitutional about the statute. Appellant also asserted that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the mitigating factor of appellant's mental retardation. The court had specifically told the jurors that the mitigating factors listed were not the sole ones to be considered. They could consider other factors and write them on the jury verdict form. The court concluded there was no impermissible exclusion of relevant mitigating factors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee argued that a state senator's appointed service with appellants, the State Board of Workforce Education and The Capitol Arts and Grounds Commission, constituted &quot;civil offices&quot; that violated the separation-of-powers mandate of Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect; 10. The court agreed, finding the positions to be civil offices, as they were a grant and possession of the sovereign power. The constitutional mandate prevented conflicts of interest a legislator might have in administering powers falling within the executive branch of government, such as appellants possessed here, the court observed. That the senator was serving in an ex officio and nonvoting capacity did not cure the illegality of a legislative appointment, the court added. His legislative authority would, no doubt, carry inordinate influence with appellants because of his position, and this exercise of executive authority was specifically forbidden to members of the General Assembly. The assertion that the senator was merely performing legislative duties when serving with appellants was without merit, the court concluded, as the senator's resources could just as easily be tapped by his attendance at public meetings.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, taxpayer and certified teachers, challenged the judgment of the Pulaski Chancery Court (Arkansas), which granted appellee state officials' motion for summary judgment in appellants' suit seeking a declaration that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 6-17-404 was unconstitutional and seeking to enjoin appellees from accepting in-kind services to teach out-of state students.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer and appellant certified teachers sued appellee state officials, contending that a state law permitting teachers from a neighboring state to teach in a border school district without state certification was unconstitutional legislation. The court first noted that appellants failed to offer proof to support their claim that population parameters of the statute limited its effect to one county. Additionally, the court held that, whether the statute was local or not, the statute was rationally related to the state's interest in assisting at least one border school district in obtaining teachers to foster better education for the students. Thus, the court held the statute did not violate constitutional prohibitions on local legislation. The court then upheld the trial court's finding that in-kind services provided to the border school district in exchange for the border school district's education of the neighboring state's students provided a benefit for, rather than an adverse impact on, in-state students. Thus, the court upheld the trial court's grant of summary judgment in appellees' favor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decision granting appellee state officials' motion for summary judgment was affirmed against appellants' action seeking a declaration that a state education law was unconstitutional and seeking to enjoin acceptance of services to teach out-of-state students. The law was rationally related to a state interest, and the state's receipt of in-kind services for educating out-of-state students did not adversely impact in-state students.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the ordinance did not violate Ark.

The court held that the ordinance was not void for vagueness when appellant had not met the heavy burden of an individual bringing a pre-enforcement challenge to an ordinance that regulated business activity. The court held that the ordinance did not violate equal protection rights because there was a rational reason for treating property owners in the undeveloped portion of the city differently.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found guilty of murdering his son and brother, and attempting to murder two of his other children. Initially, the court reversed and remanded the case after finding that it was impossible to discern whether the jury found any mitigating circumstances to consider during the penalty phase. During the resentencing hearing, the jury ultimately concluded that an aggravating circumstance justified a sentence of death beyond a reasonable doubt for each of the capital murders. On appeal of the imposition of death for the two counts of murder, the court held, after reviewing the entire record and finding no reversible error, that the trial court properly entered the sentence. For example, the court held that there was substantial evidence before the jury to support the findings that an aggravating circumstance existed, that it outweighed the mitigating circumstances, and that the aggravating circumstance that the capital murders were committed in an especially cruel and depraved manner justified the imposition of a death sentence. Furthermore, the court held that the death penalty was constitutionally imposed under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</SPAN></P>

Further, there was substantial evidence from which the jury could have inferred appellant's intent to have purposely killed the victim.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Arkansas Court of Appeals certified the appeal of appellant, a juvenile, through his father, challenging a judgment from the chancery court, which had denied his motion to stay, held that he did not have a right to assert the insanity defense during the adjudication phase, found that he had committed second-degree battery under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-13-202(a)(4) (1997), and adjudicated him delinquent under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-303 (1998).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile, who was 12 years old, had an extensive history of severe emotional and mental disorders. While in a self-contained classroom for students with severe mental disorders, he become agitated and knocked over some furniture. While the principal eased him to the floor from behind, he struck a teacher. The State initiated a delinquency proceeding against the juvenile, who gave notice of intent to raise affirmative defense of not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect and filed a motion to stay for a psychiatric evaluation. The trial court denied the motion, convicted him of second-degree battery under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-13-202(a)(4) (1997) for purposefully causing physical injury to one he knew to be a teacher on school grounds, and adjudicated him delinquent under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-303 (1998). On appeal, the court held that: (1) the only specific intent required was the intent to cause physical injury, and the trial court considered evidence the juvenile's mental and emotional disabilities in making such determination; and (2) the juvenile did not have a right to assert the insanity defense during the adjudication phase of a juvenile-delinquency proceeding.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the chancery court's judgment, which had denied the juvenile's motion to stay, found that the juvenile had committed second-degree battery, held that he did not have a right to assert the insanity defense during the adjudication phase of the juvenile-delinquency proceeding, and adjudicated the juvenile delinquent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury found defendant guilty of murder and returned a death sentence. The court affirmed the conviction but set aside the death sentence and remanded the case for resentencing. The Johnson County Circuit Court (Arkansas) held a resentencing proceeding, and a second jury sentenced defendant to death. Defendant appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the resentencing proceeding, the state introduced evidence in support of its claim that defendant had committed a prior violent felony, an aggravating circumstance. The court reversed the death sentence, finding that the state did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the prior acts of violence were felonies under North Carolina law. Although the trial court could have taken judicial notice of the felony element, it did not do so and did not instruct the jury on North Carolina law. The court declined to take judicial notice of the felony element because it had not been raised in the trial court. The court held that the error was not harmless because the jury found mitigating circumstances to exist. The court rejected defendant's argument that the state was barred from showing that he had committed a prior violent felony because neither the subsequent reversal of the North Carolina conviction nor the court's initial setting aside of the death sentence acquitted defendant for double jeopardy purposes. The trial court erred by refusing to hold a hearing in response to defendant's objection to a mental evaluation and in denying defendant's motion for a continuance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the death sentence and remanded the case for a hearing on defendant's competency. If the state continued its pursuit of the death penalty, the trial court was instructed to hold a subsequent resentencing proceeding consistent with the court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a hearing, the Board found that the counselor violated an ethical standard by failing to notify a child's psychologist that she was simultaneously seeing the child and violated Ark.

Code Ann. &sect; 17-27-102(5)(B) was unprofessional conduct. On appeal, the Board argued that its decision was supported by substantial evidence and that the circuit court erred in reversing its decision on a ground not presented to the Board. The court agreed. The court held that judicial review of Board decisions was governed by the Arkansas Administrative Procedure Act (Act), specifically Ark. Code Ann &sect; 25-15-212 (1996), and that the Board's decision should not have been reversed because it was supported by substantial evidence. The court held that it was essential to judicial review under the Act that issues had to be raised before the agency appealed from or they could not be addressed by the reviewing court.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 11-0-201, by which the Commission was established, was constitutional, and that the composition of the Commission did not deny claimants their rights to due process of the law. The claimant petitioned for review of that decision, pursuant to Ark. Sup. Ct. &amp; Ct. App. R. 1-2(e).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved a constitutional challenge to the composition of the Commission as established in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-201, which arose after the claimant sustained a compensable back injury. The claimant was awarded permanent partial disability benefits in a lump-sum award of 60 weeks based on evidence that he was diagnosed with an unrelated terminal cancer and was unlikely to survive more than 60 weeks. One month later the claimant died and the employer successfully appealed the payment of anymore lump-sum payments with the evidence of the claimant's death. The claimant appealed the Commission's decision that his death was to be considered as new evidence, and that the Commission's composition denied him due process of law. The Commission's judgment that it's composition was constitutional, was affirmed by the appellate court below. Reviewing the case de novo, the court held that the litigation had been resolved as it pertained to the parties, and that because neither the employer nor the claimant stood to lose or gain financially based upon the outcome, the court declined to address the merits of the claimant's appeal as moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An amendment to abolish ad valorem property taxes and increase sales and use taxes was filed with the secretary of state. The secretary determined that the measure's sponsor submitted the requisite number of valid signatures. The citizens group filed a complaint contesting the sufficiency of the signatures. The initiative's sponsor intervened, claiming that the petition was not deficient. The court exercised original jurisdiction under Ark. Sup. Ct. R. 6-5(a) (1998) and Ark. Sup. Ct. R. 1-2(a)(8) (1998). The court instructed a master to conduct a hearing on the issue. He found that numerous signatures counted by the secretary should have been excluded. The court held that: (1) in the case of 404 signatures, the canvasser consciously disregarded the petition instructions, admitted that she failed to collect signatures personally, and whited out canvassers' signatures replacing them with her own; (2) in the case of 241 signatures, an expert witness determined they were forgeries; (3) in the case of 244 signatures, false affidavits were signed; and (4) thus, the court could not say that the master was clearly erroneous in excluding the signatures.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the petition, held that the proposed measure lacked a sufficient number of signatures to satisfy constitutional requirements, and enjoined the secretary from placing the proposed measure on the ballot. Alternatively, the court directed that any votes cast on the proposed amendment not be counted or certified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following defendant's conviction for capital murder for the killing of his brother, defendant sought review of the judgment. The issues raised on review were whether the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for directed verdict, whether defendant was denied equal protection because he was not afforded a sentencing trial, and whether the trial court erred in refusing to exclude a taped interview from being introduced into evidence at trial. The court found that there was substantial evidence that, when stabbing and beating the victim, defendant did so with premeditation and deliberation. Further, the court held that defendant waived his right to raise the equal protection argument because it was never raised prior to his appeal. Additionally, the court found that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel as prescribed by law. In support, the court reasoned that defendant, not the police, initiated and volunteered the incriminating statements. The court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in presenting the photos because they presented strong probative evidence in proving the elements of the capital murder crime.</SPAN></P>

P. 36.4 postconviction proceedings. An attorney was appointed to represent defendant, and he alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective. Defendant further alleged that the first-degree murder statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-102(a)(2) (Supp. 1989) (since amended) was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The court denied the petition for postconviction relief. Defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court failed to comply with the federal court's order in a timely manner. The court held that it was unable to interpret and enforce a federal court order, and thus the order requiring that an Ark. R. Crim. P. 36.4 hearing be held within 90 days was outside of the court's scope of review. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-102(a)(2) was not void, as it merely covered two situations in which purposeful killing could occur.

The court found that appellee did loose his federal recognition after his appointment pursuant to &sect; 324(a) when he reached the age of 64.

Code Ann. &sect; 5-71-207 (Repl. 1997), and public intoxication. Defendant claimed that &sect; 5-71-207 was unconstitutional, the evidence was insufficient to support the other convictions, jury instructions he proffered were improperly not given, and his cross-examination of a witness was improperly limited.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While officers were investigating a traffic accident involving defendant and his girlfriend, defendant cursed at the officers despite their requests that he remain quiet while they spoke to his girlfriend. Ultimately, because of his belligerence and intoxication, the officers arrested him for disorderly conduct and public intoxication. Defendant's struggle against the arrest resulted in a charge of resisting arrest. Defendant was convicted for all three crimes. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's claim to the contrary and ruled that there was ample evidence to support the jury's verdict on the public intoxication and resisting arrest charges, in that there was evidence of a struggle and one officer's opinion testimony on intoxication was admissible. The court then rejected defendant's claim that &sect; 5-71-207&nbsp;unconstitutionally abridged his First Amendment right to criticize the police. The court ruled that the statute was constitutionally directed at and properly applied to fighting words. The court also ruled that defendant's proffered jury instructions on free speech were properly rejected and his cross-examination of one of the officers was not improperly limited.</SPAN></P>

He argued that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions and that the trial court erred in admitting evidence seized from his vehicle during a stop pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 3.1 and 2.1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that a confidential informant whom police worked with in the past informed them that defendant, an officer, was dealing illegal drugs with his brother. Consistent with the informant's tips, defendant was seen at his brother's house picking up drugs on two occasions. The police stopped defendant while he was in his vehicle, and he consented a search of his car orally and in writing. The police found drugs in the front seat and a pistol on the floor. A later search revealed more drugs in the car's rear-fender well. On appeal, the court held that the evidence sufficiently showed that defendant possessed the drugs with intent to deliver them while possessing a firearm. The court held that the firearm was in close proximity to the drugs, and even though most of the drugs were found in the rear-fender well, defendant was the sole occupant of the car. The court also ruled that defendant's possession of the firearm was relevant to prove his intent to deliver a controlled substance. The court also held that the trial court properly found that the informant's tips were sufficiently reliable so as to justify a stop under Rule 3.1, thus, the evidence was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The non-resident filed an action for illegal exaction against the city. He challenged Act 48 that permitted residents of cities divided by a &quot;state street line&quot; to pay an additional one percent sales tax in exchange for exemption from the state income tax. The city was the only eligible city. City residents intervened on the side of the city. The chancery court granted the city's motion for summary judgment. The court affirmed, finding that Act 48 did not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative authority because it presented a complete plan of what the tax status would have been if the people approved it. The mere fact that the revenue from the increased sales tax went into the state treasury did not negate the stated purpose to benefit the city by encouraging people to move across the border. Act 48 was not impermissible &quot;special&quot; or &quot;local&quot; legislation because it had a valid purpose of encouraging settlement of the city, the line was reasonably drawn along the city boundary, and the limited applicability to state street line boarder cities was rational because such cities were unique by their cohesive relationship with the mirror city.</SPAN></P>

The lower court denied summary judgment for the human services employees on the basis of qualified immunity. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the order. The court held that qualified immunity existed under Ark.

The State argued that the evidence found in defendant's truck was the result of a legal warrantless search under Ark. R. Crim. P. 5.5.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A police officer observed defendant's truck run a stop sign. The officer recognized defendant as someone he had stopped on two prior occasions. The officer stopped the truck for the violation. Defendant exited his vehicle, and the officer had defendant wait by the back of his truck while the officer searched the truck for weapons. In the truck, the officer found a prescription bottle that contained cocaine. Defendant was arrested for possession of a controlled substance. Defendant filed motions to suppress the cocaine. On appeal, the court reversed the order of the trial court, which granted defendant's motion. Under Ark. R. Crim. P. 5.5, 4.1, the officer was legally permitted to arrest defendant for the traffic violation. The ability to issue a citation in lieu of arrest gave the officer the additional authority to do a full search incident to an arrest. Under case law, the officer had the power to search the contents of the prescription bottle in which he found the cocaine. The trial court improperly concluded that because it was a mere traffic stop, the officer had no authority to search defendant's truck.

Code Ann. &sect; 18-49-104(c) (Supp. 1997) only required that notice of the sale be published in a newspaper of general circulation, and the mortgagors waived the constitutionality argument by failing to raise the argument in the trial court. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 1-49-106 (1987) provided that the mortgagors waived their right to redemption in the mortgage that was foreclosed. The right of redemption vanished by operation of the statute. The mortgagors also failed to raise the issue of an equitable redemption in the trial court, and thus, waived the issue on appeal.</SPAN></P>

An employee of the subcontractor who was covered by its workers' compensation policy was killed. The decedent's father received workers' compensation death benefits from the subcontractor. He filed a wrongful death action against the company. The trial court granted the company's motion for summary judgment because the lawsuit was barred by the exclusive remedy provision in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 11-9-105, which precluded tort actions against prime contractors, even if the subcontractor provided workers' compensation coverage. The father appealed and alleged that the provision violated Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect; 32. The court reversed and remanded. It held that the statutory language was unconstitutional. The legislature properly expanded the employer-employee relationship when it required a prime contractor to be responsible for workers' compensation benefits if the subcontractor was not. The statutory employment relationship was created. It held that absent the imposition of the statutory relationship, however, it was unconstitutional for the legislature to restrict tort actions against non-employer prime contractors.</SPAN></P>

The two defendants alleged the statute was vague in what was meant by &quot;in concert.&quot; The other defendant contended that he was too young to be tried as an adult for second-degree battery. The court affirmed the judgment against the two defendants, but reversed the judgment against the one defendant and remanded his case for transfer to juvenile court. The court concluded that &sect; 5-74-108 conveyed fair and sufficient warning of what meant by &quot;in concert&quot; to overcome a challenge for vagueness. Because the one defendant was only 14 years of age at the time of the offense, the court determined that, under Ark.

Code Ann. &sect; 5-73-121 (1993) (Act). The State of Arkansas had made out a prima facie case by showing that a knife, with a blade three and one half inches in length, had been found in defendant's possession while he was on the grounds of his Junior High School.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant had claimed that he had brought the knife to school to give to a friend. Defendant argued that the presumption included in the Act, that a person found carrying such a knife intended to use it as a weapon, unconstitutionally shifted the burden of proof to him and deprived him of due process. On appeal, the court held that because the presumption in the act was &quot;permissive&quot; and there was a rational connection between the fact proved and the fact presumed, it did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof to defendant. The court found that there was a rational connection between the fact defendant had a knife with a three and one half inch blade, which, if the facts were viewed in the light most favorable to the State, he had in his front pants pocket, and the presumption that defendant was carrying that knife as a weapon. The court noted that defendant had offered no other explanation as to why the knife was in that particular pocket, where he would have had ready access to it if he wanted to use it as a weapon. The court further noted that even if he had been bringing it to give to a friend, that did not militate against its possession as a weapon.</SPAN></P>

The patients appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court found that all claims were barred by the two-year limitations period for medical injury found in the Arkansas Medical Malpractice Act, specifically Ark.

The court held that in those cases where the doctors made affirmative misrepresentations designed to keep the patients' causes of action concealed, the statute of limitations was tolled. However, where the doctors' alleged omissions resulted merely in surgery performed without adequate informed consent, the statute was not tolled. The fraud claims against the hospital were all barred by the statute of limitations because there was no evidence of affirmative conduct on their part to conceal the patients' causes of action. The court also held that the causes of action against the hospitals in strict liability as suppliers of the devices were controlled by the two-year statute of limitations rather than the three year limitation of the Product Liability Act, specifically Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-116-103. Finally, the two-year limitations period was not unconstitutional as violative of equal protection.</SPAN></P>

Acts 438 to be unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the tax assessment on the parcels of land. The court noted that the city and the trial court agreed that the general assembly violated the doctrine of separation of powers by declaring various uses involved in the operation of an airport to be exempt from ad valorem taxation. The court held that 1995 Ark. Acts 438 must be struck in its entirety. The court found that the general assembly's per se determination that airport property was exclusively used for a public purpose was a judicial function performed only after appropriate fact-finding by a trial court. The court ruled that the city failed to meets its burden to show that the tax assessment was untimely because the airport manager admitted that she did not know when the assessment of the ad valorem taxes actually occurred.</SPAN></P>

Subsequent to the trial court's denial of the petition for writ of habeas corpus and for relief from the &quot;illegal&quot; sentence, the record was lodged before the court on appeal. Appellant filed a motion seeking an extension of time to file a brief. The court denied the motion and dismissed the appeal. The court found that the trial court did not err in denying appellant postconviction relief. The court stated that (1) appellant did not state a cognizable ground to warrant a writ of habeas corpus; (2) appellant was procedurally barred from proceeding under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-90-111 to correct his sentence because the statute was superseded by Ark. R. Crim. P. Rule 37; and (3) appellant failed to file his petition challenging the sentence within the 90-day period set by rule 37.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-701 to -713 (1951), and Miscellaneous Tax Regulations 1988-2, were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The corporation was a wholesaler of cigarettes. The Act provided that the cost of doing business by a wholesaler of cigarettes was two percent of the basic cost of the cigarettes to the wholesaler. The Act provided that the state official could adopt rules to enforce the Act. Pursuant to that authority the state official promulgated Miscellaneous Tax Regulations 1988-2, which provided that a wholesaler's cost of doing business was presumed to be four percent, not the two percent set out in the Act. The corporation was given permission to sell cigarettes at a minimum price of one-half of one percent above the basic cost of the cigarettes. The corporation's competitors received an injunction prohibiting the corporation from selling at its new minimum price. Thereafter the corporation commenced the instant action. The court found that the Act and Miscellaneous Tax Regulations 1988-2, were constitutional and did not violate due process. However, a genuine issue of material fact existed as to how the state official determined the basic cost of doing business by a wholesaler of cigarettes. Therefore, a remand was necessary.</SPAN></P>

A professional conduct committee sought disbarment on the ground that the attorney violated Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct R. 8.4(b) and the lower court entered summary judgment in favor of the same. The attorney appealed alleging, inter alia, that his misdemeanor convictions did not constitute a violation of R. 8.4(b) because he did not commit the crimes with the culpable mens rea. The court affirmed the order in part and reversed and remanded on the issue of the appropriate sanctions. The court held that the undisputed facts established that the attorney's convictions violated R. 8.4(b) because they involved dishonesty and breach of trust, and seriously undermined the confidence of the public in the legal profession, all of which were prohibited under R. 8.4(b).</SPAN></P>

Before the case was submitted to the jury, the parties stated at a bench conference that, if the jury determined that the insured's home was a total loss, they would stipulate as to the amount to which the insured would be entitled.

The Agency determined that there was not a sufficient need for a nursing home because there were approximately 389 beds empty in the county on any given day. The Commission properly concluded that the required occupancy rate was not shown. The Agency also determined that the nursing home's assessment of economic feasibility was unrealistically optimistic. The court determined that the findings of the Agency and the Commission were supported by substantial evidence.

The court found that all jurors had pledged that they could decide the case based solely on the evidence and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's change-of-venue motion. The court held that there was no reversible error by the trial court because defendant neither objected to certain testimony on the basis of improper character evidence nor requested the trial court to admonish the jury as to certain permitted testimony. The court found that victim-impact evidence was not an additional aggravating circumstance but was relevant evidence.

The action was filed slightly over two years after the alleged malpractice. The trial court, citing judicial precedent, held that the action was governed by the two-year statute of limitations contained in the Medical Malpractice Act (Act), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-203 (Supp. 1995). The estate administrator contended that, because the decedent's surgery occurred before the decisions relied upon by the trial court were rendered, the holdings should not be retroactively applied and the three-year statute of limitations of the state's wrongful death statute should apply. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that there was no justifiable reliance to assume that the three-year statute of limitations would apply.

The trial court, upon his conviction, imposed the death penalty. Defendant raised five errors on appeal. First, he contended that the State unconstitutionally struck two black persons from the jury. He further argued that the trial court erred in introducing victim-impact evidence and in refusing to prohibit the State from seeking the death penalty because it was imposed in a racially discriminatory manner. Further, defendant argued that the provisions of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-603 (Repl. 1994) that prohibited the jury from exercising mercy were unconstitutional. Finally, he contended that it was error to allow the State to utilize two aggravating circumstances for sentencing, that he was imprisoned as a result of a felony conviction and that he had previously committed a violent felony, when they were duplications. The court affirmed, finding no merit in defendant's arguments. The court found that defendant, primarily, had made no effort to show a disproportionate exclusion of blacks from the jury and showed no pattern of strikes evidencing discriminatory purpose.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed. Petitioner sought leave from the court to proceed in the circuit court pursuant to Criminal Procedure Rule 37 (Arkansas).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitions under Rule 37 in cases where judgment was entered before July 1, 1989, had to demonstrate that the judgment was void to be entitled to relief if more than three years had passed since the date of judgment. Judgment had been entered in petitioner's case about sixteen years before the petition was filed. Petitioner, in his petition, concluded that the judgment entered against him was void. The court denied the petition because none of the allegations raised in the petition was sufficient to void the judgment entered in 1981. The court found that (1) petitioner's assertions of ineffective assistance of counsel and trial error were not claims sufficient to demonstrate that the judgment entered against him was a complete nullity; and (2) while claims asserted by petitioner, that he was not competent to stand trial and that the trial court lacked jurisdiction, could be sufficient to render a judgment void if proven, petitioner had merely stated the allegations as conclusions without any factual substantiation for either claim.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that at his trial his counsel indicated that defendant had given him a list of seven or eight witnesses and that he needed more time to interview them. Defendant informed the trial court that he was ready for trial and did not want a continuance. He stated that he was willing to take that chance and proceed to trial. Defense counsel moved to sever the charge of first-degree battery, pertaining to the shooting of Robinson, from the remaining charges, which resulted from defendant's arrest the day after the shooting. Defendant again expressed his desire to proceed to trial as scheduled on all charges.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the Pulaski Circuit Court (Arkansas), which convicted him of two counts each of kidnapping and aggravated robbery. Pursuant to the three-strikes sentencing statute,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-501(d) (Supp. 1995), the trial court sentenced defendant to life in prison without parole. Defendant challenged the constitutionality of &sect; 5-4-501(d) and the trial court's refusal to admit character evidence at sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and another robbed a pharmacist and his employee of drugs and cash at gunpoint. The victims were made to lie on the floor while they were bound with duct tape. They managed to free themselves, and the pharmacist and defendant exchanged gunfire. The court found that defendant had no basis for urging his argument that &sect; 5-4-501(d) was ambiguous because, as the result of the verdict forms and instruction submitted to the jury, he received the benefit of the more liberal of the two possible interpretations. Defendant was eligible for an enhanced sentence whether the language in &sect; 5-4-501(d)(1), or the language in &sect; 5-4-501(d)(3)(A), controlled. Thus, defendant lacked standing because he clearly fell within the conduct proscribed by the statute. Defendant had clear warning from the statute that, at a minimum, he was facing a sentence of life in prison without parole if he were found to have committed qualifying offenses on separate and distinct occasions. The trial court ruled correctly that tape-recorded statements, not subject to cross-examination, would be hearsay. Defendant was not prejudiced by the ruling because the three-strikes statute mandated life without parole.</SPAN></P>

The court found most of defendant's assignments of error to be meritless or procedurally barred from review. In agreeing with defendant's final point of error, the court found that the record failed to reflect whether a hearing was held on the suppression motion or whether a ruling was made.

Code Ann. &sect; 26-51-205 (Repl. 1992). The taxpayers contended that the tax statute violated Ark. Const. art. V, &sect; 38 and their equal protection rights.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers were certified as a class of corporations with annual net incomes exceeding $ 100,000. The taxpayers contended that under appellees' interpretation of the Act, they were improperly required to pay a tax rate of six and one-half percent on their first $ 100,000 of income as opposed to a graduated tax rate of between one to six percent that was paid by corporations earning less than $ 100,000 per year. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings. The court held that the Act was properly enacted under the emergency provisions of Ark. Const. art. V, &sect; 38, requiring a vote of three-fourths of the members of the legislature. The court held that the department improperly interpreted the Act. The court interpreted the Act to apply a graduated tax rate on the first $ 100,000 of net income earned by all corporations, regardless of their total annual net income. The court held that under this interpretation, the Act did not violate the taxpayers' equal protection rights. The court also held that the class certification order was improper because it should not have included taxpayers that did not file refund claims.</SPAN></P>

The State could not appeal from the dismissal of a petition to revoke a felon's probation under Rule 36.10 (Arkansas). Furthermore, the court could not say that the Arkansas General Assembly clearly indicated that forfeiture under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-64-505 was always civil in nature. Because of this, the court had to examine the manner in which the statute was applied to the facts of the particular case. Therefore, while there was authority for finding that civil forfeiture under &sect; 5-64-505 was not punishment for double jeopardy purposes, the analysis also hinged on how the statute was applied in the particular case. There was little evidence suggesting that the forfeiture proceeding against defendant's vehicle was so punitive in form and effect so as to render the proceeding criminal. Moreover, the statute, as applied, was not used as a criminal penalty. The State brought the action under the in rem portion of the statute, and the action was brought against defendant's vehicle.</SPAN></P>

The natural father moved to &quot;reopen&quot; the adoption proceeding on the basis that he had not consented to the adoption and had not received notice of the hearing. The mother and adoptive father alleged that the natural father was not entitled to notice because he was not registered as a putative father pursuant to Ark.

The court affirmed the trial court and held that the natural father's consent was not required. The mother's acrimony was insufficient to justify the natural father's failure to support or to communicate with the child.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged a decision from the Scott Chancery Court (Arkansas), which upheld the validity of two ordinances establishing a solid-waste management program and providing health insurance benefits to quorum court members. The taxpayer contested the validity of the ordinances in a class action brought against appellees, a county and the members of the county quorum court in their individual and official capacities.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought an action challenging the validity of Scott County, Ark., Ordinance 92-3 (Jan. 13, 1992), and Scott County, Ark., Ordinance 96-3 (Jan. 3, 1996). The former provided for a solid-waste management program and established a solid-waste collection fee. The latter provided quorum court members with health insurance benefits with the expressed purpose of compensating them for rendering judicial duties. The taxpayer contended that the solid-waste ordinance as an emergency appropriations ordinance could not levy taxes or fees and that the health insurance benefits were illegal compensation. On appeal, the court held that: (1) the solid-waste ordinance as an appropriations ordinance merely set aside revenue and did not enact a tax or impose a fee; (2) the improper addition of an emergency clause to the solid-waste ordinance did not render the entire ordinance inoperative; (3) the county was not precluded from establishing a solid-waste monopoly and did not violate any duty by failing to award a bid to the lowest private bidder for such services; however, (4) health insurance for the quorum judges was illegal compensation under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-14-1205(c) (Supp. 1995).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's decision insofar as it upheld the validity of the county's solid-waste ordinance. The court reversed the trial court's decision insofar as it upheld the validity of the ordinance awarding the quorum judges health insurance benefits. The court remanded the cause with directions to enjoin the quorum court from paying health insurance benefits in their behalf and ordered that such payments be repaid.</SPAN></P>

The ex-wife's mother testified that defendant made threats &quot;all the time&quot; that he would kill his then-wife while they were separated. Defendant argued that the testimony was too remote in time from the assaults. The trial court charged the jury under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-97-103(1)(Supp. 1995) and Ark.

The court held that the testimony was not so remote in time as to have rendered it irrelevant. It was not error to charge the jury on the correct state of the law regarding parole and transfer eligibility. The trial court had discretion in determining whether to run the sentences consecutively or concurrently. The record showed that the trial court did not simply follow the jury's recommendation, but considered defendant's objections to consecutive sentences and exercised its own discretion.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted in municipal court and appealed to the circuit court.

Defendant appealed, and the state cross-appealed from the dismissal of the refusal-to-submit charge. The court affirmed the convictions, and found error in the dismissal of the refusal-to-submit charge. The convictions were supported by the observations of the officer who administered the one-leg-stand test and the finger-count test, which defendant failed. The conviction for making an improper left turn was supported by the officer's testimony. The court held that the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of refusing to submit to a test. The officer requested defendant to take a blood test, which was refused, and gave defendant the option of submitting to a urine test.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Over defendant's objection, the circuit judge refused to instruct the jury on the charge of refusal to submit to the breathalyzer test. Defendant argued that the statutory provision governing the offense at the time of his arrest, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-65-205(c) (Repl. 1993), which provided for a judicial determination and not a trial by jury, deprived him of his right to a jury trial. The court reversed. It noted that, as Arkansas's refusal-to-submit law only authorized the suspension or revocation of an accused's driver's license, there was no Sixth Amendment right to jury trial. The court also noted, however, that when a conviction was appealed from a municipal court to a circuit court, the case was tried de novo, and the appellant was entitled to a trial by jury. The court found that a conviction for refusal to submit to a breath test, like any other criminal offense, was subject to Arkansas law that guaranteed the right to a jury trial unless that right was expressly waived. The court concluded that, to the extent that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-65-205(c) (Repl. 1993) prevented defendant from having a jury determine guilt, it unconstitutionally infringed upon the right to jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The administratrix argued that the court's application of the two-year medical malpractice statute of limitations to wrongful death actions violated notions of due process and equal protection under the federal and state constitutions. The court declined to address the merits of the administratrix's argument because the administratrix never obtained a ruling on her constitutional argument from the trial court and because the administratrix lacked standing to raise the issue. The court held that the administratrix was not a member of the class of persons she claimed would be deprived of due process and equal protection of the law. In order for a litigant to have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a law, it had to be unconstitutional as applied to him. Generally, one must have suffered injury or have belonged to a class that was prejudiced in order to have standing to challenge the validity of a law. Constitutional rights were personal rights and could not be raised by a third party unless the third party was sufficiently interested in the outcome that the interest of the party whose constitutional rights were allegedly deprived would be adequately represented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Act passed by the general assembly appropriated 20 million dollars in state funds to construct a civic center in a particular county. In granting the motions for summary judgment filed by the state and the county, the trial court concluded that the general assembly rationally decided that a civic center located in the county would enhance tourism, recreation, and economic development of the entire state, and therefore, the Act withstood the taxpayer's various constitutional challenges. On appeal, the taxpayer raised several challenges to the Act. In affirming the judgment, the court held that: (1) the trial judge properly concluded that the Act was not local legislation because the decision to locate the civic center in only one county of the state was rationally related to the purposes of the Act, as required by Ark. Const. art. 14; (2) the Act contained a distinct statement of its purpose and properly stated that the purpose would be met by defraying the cost of constructing and equipping the center, in compliance with the requirements of Ark. Const. art. 5, &sect; 29; and (3) the taxpayer failed to meet the burden of proving how the Act violated other constitutional provisions.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of murder in the lower court and sentenced to death. The lower court did not err in allowing the use of voter registration records to select the jury panel. Although defendant showed that the jury venire was not racially representative of the community, he did not produce evidence demonstrating that the alleged misrepresentation of African-Americans was due to a systematic exclusion in the jury selection system. Defendant failed to show that blood evidence taken from his shoes, all of which was tested by the state's crime laboratory, possessed any exculpatory value before it was destroyed. The testimony of a witness that, on the day of the murder, defendant told her that he was going to buy some cocaine, was properly admitted under Ariz. R.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted of two counts of capital murder and was sentenced to death. Upon review, the court affirmed his convictions, but reversed the death penalty sentence and remanded for new sentencing. The court held that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-102 (Repl. 1993) was not unconstitutional on the ground that the mens rea in the capital murder statute and the mens rea in the first-degree murder statute overlapped because Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-603(a) (1987 &amp; Repl. 1993) sufficiently narrowed the class of persons eligible for the death penalty. The court found the trial court did not error by allowing the admission of a videotape and photographs of the crime scene into evidence where the evidence was relevant for purposes of showing defendant's intent. The court reasoned that the photographs and videotape showed the victims had been shot at close range in the head, which was indicative of premeditation and deliberation. The court concluded that reversible error occurred by the jury's failure to complete written findings that the aggravating circumstances justified beyond a reasonable doubt a sentence of death as required by &sect; 5-4-601(a).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 14-42-10 8 (1987) made it unlawful for a municipal official to receive water, gas, or electric current without paying for it at the same rate as the general public or to furnish any person service from any public utility unless payment was made at the usual and regular rates. Only city officials who violated those statutory provisions were subject to removal from office. The mayor argued that the court failed to address his argument that the statute did not afford him the equal protection of the laws because county officials were not subject to its provisions. The court noted that, to meet his burden, the mayor had to show that the disparate statutory treatment of county and city officers was arbitrary and capricious and was completely devoid of any legitimate purpose. The convictions that led to the mayor's removal involved an abuse of power that the public specifically entrusted to some public officials. The court found that coupling an extraordinary statutory grant of power to a municipal officer with a provision of ineligibility to hold office if that power was abused was rationally related to a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>

The complaint, which sought a writ of mandamus against the clerk and the school district, a writ of prohibition against the collection of the tax, a declaratory judgment that the tax violated Amendment 59, and an injunction against further violations, was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court reversed finding that jurisdiction was properly in the circuit court because the trial court erred in finding that a county tax was involved where the county's power did not include the power to levy school taxes, which rested entirely with the school district and, hence, the state. The circuit court had exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction because a valid claim for an illegal exaction was raised where the issue was not the reassessment, but the tax itself, which allegedly exceeded constitutional limits based on the district's failure to roll back taxes.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 14-42-108(a)(1), (b)(1) for receiving and furnishing others with water services without requiring payment at the regular rates.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that testimony that defendant gave the order to remove his store from the billing requirement for sewer service without disconnecting the store from the sewer line was evidence that he used his office to obtain preferential treatment not available to the general public. Additionally, there was sufficient evidence to find that defendant, without authority to do so, adjusted or dismissed payments due by others on their water and sewer bills. As a result of the convictions, defendant was removed from office and was deemed ineligible thereafter to hold municipal office. The court held that the statute that excluded defendant from holding office in the municipality was not punitive in nature, but only restricted defendant's privilege of holding municipal office to protect the public from a recurrence of the abuses that led to the convictions. The court held that the provision that excluded defendant from holding office again in the same city was not unconstitutional. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The official was elected to serve as a member of the commission by a majority vote of the city council. Shortly thereafter, the mayor vetoed his election. The city council defeated a motion to override the veto. The official sought declaratory and injunctive relief. In the alternative, he prayed that the ordinance creating the commission, West Memphis, Ark., Ord. No. 1069, be declared unconstitutional because it was adopted without legislative authority. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees. On appeal, the official contended that the circuit court erred in concluding that the ordinance properly established the commission as a valid city agency. He asserted that the city council enacted the ordinance without statutory authority and, therefore, all commission actions were of no effect. The court disagreed and affirmed. A public utilities commission could be created in accordance with statutory dictates but a commission to operate the utilities also could be established as an agency of the city. A city did not need to create an operating commission in accordance with legislative requirements so long as the commission remained an agency of the city.</SPAN></P>

Const. Amend. 14. Appellants sought review of the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The background of the case involved the dispute over the manner of electing the City of Texarkana's directors, which system had been held by a federal district court to violate the federal Voting Rights Act because it deprived African-American citizens of an equal opportunity to participate in the political process. At a subsequent election, the voters of Texarkana approved a system by which six directors would be elected from districts and one at large, i.e., a &quot;6-1 plan.&quot; Act 8 was the second of two attempts by the State General Assembly to deal with the situation. The circuit court determined that Act 8 was not in violation of Ark. Const. amend. 14. However, on account of appellants' woefully deficient abstract of the record, the court could not discern why the circuit court had so determined. Because the abstract was so deficient, it did not comply with Arkansas Supreme Court and Court of Appeals Rule 4-2, and the court affirmed the circuit court's judgment, per Ark. Sup. Ct. R. 4-2(b)(2).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant one and defendant two were convicted and sentenced for capital murders of three young boys. For each of the capital murders, defendant one was sentenced to death, and defendant two was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. On appeal, they raised several arguments. Defendant one separately appealed the death sentences imposed upon him. The court determined that ample direct evidence in the form of two witnesses' testimony and circumstantial evidence was presented to support their convictions. The court also concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendants' motion for severance. Defendants' respective trial strategies were not so conflicting that each defendant's assertion of their respective defense would expose the other to prejudice, so the jury could simultaneously consider both their defenses. Defendants' other claimed errors relative jury instructions and evidence were also found to lack merit. Finally, the court held that the death sentence was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant one. The judgments of conviction and sentences were therefore affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer purchased a car and paid state sales tax on both the car and an extended service contract. The state denied the taxpayer's claim for a refund of the sales tax attributable to the service contract. Subsequently, the taxpayer filed an action against the state and sought a refund of the sales tax and certification as a class. The trial court ruled that the service contracts were not taxable, certified a class of taxpayers under Ark. R. Civ. P. 23, and directed each class member to submit a claim for refund. On appeal, the state argued that the trial court erred in ruling that the service contracts were not taxable and lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to certify the class. The court affirmed the ruling that service contracts were not taxable and reversed the ruling certifying the class. The court held that an extended warranty was not taxable under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 26-52-301(3)(C)(i), because the extended warranty was not service of a motor vehicle.

Defendant appealed, arguing that testimony by a police officer at his trial about defendant's identification in a photo lineup by the victim's six-year-old daughter was inadmissible hearsay. The court ruled that for a statement to qualify as an exception to the hearsay rule as an excited utterance, there must be an occasion which excited the declarant, and the statement must be uttered during the period of excitement and must express the declarant's reaction to the occasion. Further, the court held that if there was a sudden event which startled the declarant, his ensuing utterance was assumed to be his reaction to the stimulus. The court reversed the judgment convicting defendant, concluding that the testimony by the police officer of the child's selection from the photo lineup should have been excluded as unreliable hearsay and as running contrary to defendant's right to confront the witnesses against him.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the proposed Amendment 9 was nothing more than a coercive attempt to compel the Arkansas General Assembly to do as the alleged majority of the people wished, without any intellectual debate, deliberation, or consideration of whether such action is in the best interest of all the people of the state. This intent was clear from the language of the proposed Amendment 9 that the legislators were hereby instructed to do as told. The proposed Amendment 9 was clearly violative of the provision in U.S. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners generally contended that the ballot title was too long, complex, and detailed to permit a voter to read and comprehend the proposed amendment and make an informed decision on the proposal. The length of the proposed amendment necessarily caused the proposal's sponsors to omit important provisions of the proposal when preparing the ballot title. The court agreed that there were numerous material omissions from the ballot title that clearly prevented a fair understanding of the amendment. While Amendment seven did not limit the length of a proposal, the proposed measure had to be of a size capable of having a ballot title which would not only convey the scope and import of the measure, but also impart a description of the proposal so voters could cast their votes intelligently and with a fair understanding of the issue. In this respect, the ballot title failed.</SPAN></P>

The victim then brought an action against the car owner's insurer, and was awarded a judgment by the trial court. The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and dismissed the action, concluding that venue had been improperly laid. The court noted that action was not for personal injury as contended by the victim, allowing venue in the victim's county of residence; rather, the statute allowing an action to recover an unsatisfied judgment directly against an insurer was a statute of subrogation. The right to bring the action under the statute was therefore contractual, and if it applied at all to an insurance policy neither issued nor delivered in Arkansas, placed the victim in the shoes of the insured seeking coverage under the insurance agreement. The court noted that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 23-79-204 (Repl. 1992), the special venue statute governing an action for loss by an insured under an insurance policy, provided that the action was to be brought in the county in which the loss occurred or the county of the insured's residence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to the trial court's de novo review of his conviction, defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of speedy trial pursuant to Ark.

In an attempt to show no violation of the speedy trial requirements, the state presented letters to defendant from his previous attorney that urged defendant to contact the attorney concerning his case. When the state called the attorney to testify about the communications, defendant objected on the basis of attorney-client privilege. The trial court overruled the objection and found no violation of Rule 28.1. On review, the court reversed. The court noted that defendant's refusal to communicate with the attorney convinced the trial court to dismiss the appeal. The court held that the testimony relating to the communications was privileged, because the communications, which were not intended to be disclosed to third persons, were &quot;confidential.&quot; Thus, the court held that the testimony should not have been admitted into evidence. The court also held that the state could not invoke an exception to the privilege rule because the attorney's testimony did not relate to any alleged breach of duty between defendant and the attorney.</SPAN></P>

The state sought review of the appellate court's decision.

Testimony from witnesses that they did not see the victim with a gun, that defendant chased the victim around a car with a gun and shooting at the victim, that defendant shot the victim after the victim begged not to be shot, and that defendant tried to hide after the shooting was sufficient for the jury to infer that defendant acted with the purpose of causing the victim's death. The same evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that defendant did not act with justification in shooting the victim. Defendant's challenges to Act 535 of 1993, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-97-101 to 104, the sunset provision of Act 565, the bifurcation process, victim impact evidence, and voir dire were without merit.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mother challenged an order of the Chancery Court of Pulaski County (Arkansas). The paternity case was first decided in 1982 when the court entered a final judgment declaring appellee to be the father of appellant's infant child. Twelve and one-half years later, the father filed a pro se motion in chancery court, requesting the court to order a paternity test, the test excluded him as the father, and set aside the 12 year old judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, was whether the chancery court had authority to grant the father's motion and set aside the earlier paternity judgment. He personally appeared at the 1981 county court proceedings, but there was nothing in the record or judgments in that action that showed he ever claimed indigency or asked the state to pay for the paternity test which he later claimed. The county court judgment reflected that he appeared in person, was ordered to deposit the cost of the paternity test and was informed that, if he failed to pay for the test, or if the test failed to exclude him as being the father, paternity would be established and support would be set at $ 50.00 per month. Accordingly, in its 1982 judgment, the county court found exactly that. He filed no timely appeal from that paternity judgment, nor did he file post-trial motions for a new trial. While he sought, twelve years later, to assert he was indigent and unable to pay for a paternity test in the 1981 and 1982 paternity proceedings, the court held that it would not go behind a judgment that was valid on its face, to raise such factual issues anew.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer, a corporation, purchased all of the assets of another corporation which was engaged in the business of highway construction, production of asphalt and concrete, and stone quarrying. The taxpayer continued in that business. The assets included a number of used motor vehicles and trailers, and the taxpayer was assessed state and local sales tax on their value. The department denied its claim for a refund. The court reversed the trial court judgment ordering a refund to the taxpayer and remanded the action. The specific exemption for the private sale of used vehicles contained in 1945 Ark. Acts 54 was deleted from the gross receipts taxation statutes by 1959 Ark. Acts 260. The general isolated sale exemption was never applicable to used vehicle sales because the private sale exemption for used vehicles was included in the same act that first imposed a sales tax on such vehicles. Codification errors did not support the claim for exemption, and non-repealer statements in subsequent amendments did not resurrect the exemption when it had clearly and specifically been repealed in 1959. 1995 Ark. Acts 268 did not retroactively change existing law by reviving the exemption.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The radiologist allegedly reported to the doctor that the barbed tip of the needle was &quot;not seen.&quot; The patient was not advised of the fact until a year later, and she required additional surgery to remove the foreign object. The trial court found that the malpractice claims were barred by the two-year statute of limitations, under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-203 (Supp. 1995). The court held that there was a disputed issue of material fact as to whether there was fraudulent concealment of the foreign object. The trial court had determined that plaintiffs were not entitled to the one-year discovery extension under &sect; 16-114-203(b) because the object was found within two years of the negligent act. The current statute of limitations did not obviate the common law exception for fraudulent concealment. The doctor had a professional duty to speak if he knew that a foreign object remained, and there was evidence that he was informed by the radiologist. The wrongful act continued until the concealment ended.

The court concluded that there was substantial evidence that defendant was maintaining a place where gambling took place and that he was well aware of the gambling. The undercover officers testified that the betting among patrons was loud enough and open enough that it would have been virtually impossible not to have been aware of the gambling. Defendant contended that &sect; 5-66-103 was unconstitutionally overboard because its wording was so inclusive that it may have criminalized perfectly innocent conduct.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers all purchased a manufactured or mobile home located in a mobile home park, and the Department of Finance collected sales tax from the taxpayers on the purchases.

The chancery court ruled for the taxpayers, and the Department of Finance and commissioner of revenues sought review. The court held that the basic rules for determining whether an article remained personal property or became a fixture were (1) whether the items were annexed to the realty; (2) whether the items were appropriate and adapted to the use or purpose of that part of the realty to which the items are connected; and (3) whether the party making the annexation intended to make it permanent. The court held that the evidence did not support the finding that the annexation of the mobile homes was intended to be permanent.

The court then held that the trial court did not err in refusing defendant's proffered instructions on &quot;imperfect self defense&quot; and on mistake. The court also held that the trial court did not err in refusing to strike a juror for cause because the juror's remarks concerning her belief in the death penalty did not establish that she was unfit to serve. Reviewing the record of the penalty phase of the trial, the court affirmed only one of the death sentences and reversed the remaining three sentences. In reaching its conclusion, the court held that the evidence supported a finding that the aggravating circumstance of murder to &quot;avoid arrest&quot; applied to only one of the killings, rather than to all four.</SPAN></P>

The suit also alleged that the funding system violated the equal protection and due process clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The chancellor ruled that the funding system did not violate the federal constitution. However, she also ruled that the funding system violated the state constitution, and she stayed the effect of her decision for two years to allow the state assembly to enact a new funding system. The government officials sought review, and the court dismissed the appeal for lack of a final order. A final order was a requisite for appellate review. For a judgment to final and appealable, it must have dismissed the parties from the court, discharged them from the action, or have concluded their rights to the subject matter in controversy. To be final, an order must have put the court's directive into execution. The chancellor's staying of relief, and the failure to grant the requested relief, did not put the chancellor's directive into execution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The fuel retailers threatened to sue the petroleum company because it was selling its gas at levels below those set by the Arkansas Petroleum Trade Practices Act. The company brought an action against appellees in the trial court, alleging that the Act was unconstitutional because of its failure to include an element of predatory intent for a violation. The company further argued that the prohibition under the Act of below-cost sales violated its property and liberty interests by regulating innocent pricing decisions. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees, holding that the Act was constitutional and that the prohibition against below-cost sales was reasonable. The court reversed, holding that the Act was constitutionally infirm because of its failure to include an element of predatory intent, and that it was overbroad in that it prohibited legitimate and innocent competition fostered by below-cost sales. If an act penalized innocent acts not reasonably related to the problem of monopolistic practices or other deceptive, disruptive, or destructive price-cutting, the act was too broad.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was present when his friends beat, sexually molested, and killed three young boys. Defendant chased down one of the boys and turned him over to the friends. Defendant knew the night before that his friends were planning to harm young boys. Defendant was convicted of first degree murder as to one boy and second degree murder as to the other two. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant was not entitled to a directed verdict on first degree murder because there was sufficient evidence that he acted as an accomplice under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-10-102(a)(2) (1993). The court held that defendant's confession was voluntary because he knowingly waived his rights three times and the police tactics were not coercive. Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-89-111(d) (1987) was not unconstitutional in that corroboration for a confession was less stringent than that for accomplice testimony because greater safeguards were not needed for a confession. The trial court's rulings on various evidentiary issues were not error because there was no abuse of discretion. Use of the state pattern jury instruction on accomplice liability was valid because it properly stated the law.</SPAN></P>

The city denied the application. The trial court reversed the city's decision and rezoned the land, holding that the city's decision was arbitrary. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and dismissed the action. The court held that the city's zoning ordinance was presumptively valid, and that the mobile home park had the burden of proving that there was no rational basis for the city's refusal to rezone. The court determined that the mobile home park had failed to meet its burden. The court ruled that the trial court's review was limited to whether there was a rational basis for the city's refusal to rezone the land, and that the trial court had improperly considered the substantive merits of the city's decision. The court held, therefore, that the trial court had violated the constitutional separation of powers by taking discretion granted to the city by the state legislature and placing it in the judicial branch.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state officials sought review of a decision of the Pulaski County Chancery Court (Arkansas), which declared void two acts calling for a constitutional convention and the appropriation to finance the convention and enjoined a special election called pursuant to the acts. Appellees, citizens and others, challenged a trial court ruling that the act was not an unlawful encroachment on rights under Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect;&sect; 1, 29.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The legislature passed two acts calling for a constitutional convention and for a new constitution, as well as for appropriations, subject to ratification by the voters. The acts contained emergency clauses making the effective date for the acts the date of passage and approval. The trial court found the emergency clauses invalid as there was no emergency stated. Therefore, that clause rendered the entire act void and an illegal exaction resulted if funds were expended for a special election for the convention. The court reversed the declaration that the acts were void and the enjoining of the special election because an emergency was stated by the fact that the constitution was archaic and obsolete and that a new constitution was required. The fact that reasonable persons differed made the provision valid. The court further held that the chancery court had subject matter jurisdiction because the case had multiple aspects. On the cross-appeal, the court affirmed the trial court's ruling of no encroachment of art. 2, &sect;&sect; 1, 29 because the act provided for ratification by the voters, and the one-person, one-vote principle did not apply to constitutional conventions.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued that the implied consent statute was unconstitutional. The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction and suspension of his license. The court noted that it previously held that while the legislature had created varying penalties for violation of the statute's mandates, possession of an Arkansas driver's license carried with it the implied obligation to abide by state driving laws. Both Arkansas residents who drove without a valid driver's license and nonresidents who drove while their license or driving privilege was under suspension were subject to additional punishment pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 27-16-301 and &sect; 27-16-303 (Repl. 1994). Taking these factors into consideration, the court held that the varying punishments of the implied consent statute were not devoid of a legitimate purpose.

Code Ann. &sect; 5-74-105(a)(1) (Repl. 1993) and second degree unlawful discharge of a firearm from a vehicle pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-74-107(b)(1) (Repl. 1993).</SPAN></P>

After entering guilty pleas to federal gun possession offenses, defendants filed motions to dismiss in the State criminal proceeding and argued that double jeopardy barred further prosecution because Ark.

The State appealed pursuant to Ark. R. Crim. P. 36.10(b-c), contending that the State offenses were not the &quot;same offense&quot; as the federal ones because each State offense required proof of an element that the federal offenses did not. On appeal, the court held that it failed to see how the correct and uniform administration of the criminal law was required or affected.

The court determined there was no Miranda violation. Defendant maintained the trial court erred in denying his motion for continuance. Defendant failed to file affidavits in support of his motion. The court stated the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for continuance when the motion was not in substantial compliance with the applicable code. Defendant contended that overlapping between the capital murder statute and the first-degree murder statute allowed the jury to make an unconstitutionally capricious choice of crime and punishment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Court of Appeals (Arkansas) certified defendant's appeal to the court per Ark. Sup. Ct. R. 1-2(d)(2) as involving a legal principle of major importance. Defendant had challenged an order from the trial court, which convicted defendant of disorderly conduct and refusal to submit to arrest, and fined her $ 100 and $ 500, respectively.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court convicted defendant of disorderly conduct and refusal to submit to arrest, and fined her $ 100 and $ 500, respectively. On appeal, defendant contended for the first time that the Constitutions of the United States and the State of Arkansas entitled her to be tried by a 12 member jury. The court reversed and remanded the case to the trial court for a new trial. The court held that in every criminal trial where there was a right to trial by jury, the trial court should proceed as if there would be a jury trial, and it was the trial court's burden to ensure that, if there was to be a waiver, the defendant waived her right to trial by jury in accordance with the Arkansas Constitution and Rules of Criminal Procedure. The court concluded that, in short, there was no waiver in the manner prescribed by law, and defendant's case must therefore be reversed and remanded.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged judgments of the Sebastian County Circuit Court, Fort Smith District (Arkansas), which convicted them of distribution of handbills in violation of the Fort Smith Municipal Code of Ordinances &sect; 14-51. Appellants asserted that the ordinance was unconstitutional because it was overbroad and impermissibly burdened their rights to free speech and exercise of religion protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court noted that appellants failed to obtain the trial court's ruling on the issue of the constitutionality of the ordinance. However, assuming that the judgments of conviction implicitly contained such a ruling, the court was still precluded from considering the appeal on its merits. First, appellants' overbreadth argument was raised for the first time on appeal. Hence, no ruling was obtained from the trial court on this issue, even implicitly. Second, those constitutional arguments that were raised at trial were precluded from review on appeal by appellants' failure to obtain the trial court's ruling specifying which of the ordinance's subsections were violated. Subsections (a) and (c) referred to activity on public property. Subsection (b) referred to activity on private premises. Subsection (c) referred to placing literature on vehicles. Appellants claimed they were found guilty of violating the ordinance by placing literature on vehicles. However, the record contained no ruling regarding whether their conduct occurred on public property, private premises, or both. The court refused to speculate as to which subsections were violated by appellants' actions.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the decision to excuse a juror for cause rested within the sound discretion of the trial court and would not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. The court found that there was sufficient evidence of robbery to convict. The court opined that the defendant was not denied due process of law because the state was dilatory in providing the names and addresses of state witnesses, the opinion of the expert witness regarding the type of gun involved, autopsy photographs, and a diagram of the laundromat by a crime scene specialist. The court articulated that testimony that defendant was the person in crime scene surveillance videotapes because of their reasonable association with defendant.

The defendant appealed the municipal court convictions to the circuit court by notice of appeal filed on December 29, 1993. A jury trial was conducted in the circuit court on November 4, 1994, before the chancellor, who was sitting in exchange for the circuit judge. The defendant was again found guilty of the charges against him and his driver's license was suspended for 90 days and 6 months, he was fined $ 1,000, ordered to pay court costs, sentenced to 5 days in jail, and ordered to complete a treatment program. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated because the one year speedy trial period began to run from the day the defendant's appeal was filed in the circuit court. The court also held that the chancellor had the authority to sit as a judge in the criminal case because when he so presided, he did so as a circuit judge, not as a chancellor.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court issued a preliminary injunction preventing the secretary from canvassing returns and counting the votes on a proposed constitutional amendment, for failure to comply with the publishing requirements of Ark. Const. art. 19, &sect; 22. The court held that the chancery court did not abuse its discretion by granting the preliminary injunction. The court found that the doctrine of laches did not apply to the taxpayer, who did not file his petition for an injunction until three weeks before the election, because the taxpayer sought to enforce his constitutional right to be fully informed on a proposed constitutional amendment and the chancery court had found that the taxpayer was irreparably harmed by the secretary's failure to comply with the requirement for publication. The chancery court correctly found that the harm that would accrue to the taxpayer by not granting the injunction outweighed the harm that would accrue to appellants by granting it because no monetary value could be placed on the taxpayer's right to be fully and adequately informed of constitutional amendments, which was inherent in the six-month publication requirement of Article 19, &sect; 22.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The majority of those voting in a county election adopted a one-cent sales and use tax. The taxpayer contended that the new tax violated Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 9. The court affirmed the summary judgment in favor of the quorum court. The court determined that Ark. Const. art. 16, as originally adopted by vote of the people, and as amended in 1980, made specific reference only to property taxes. Based on the historical context of the 1874 Arkansas Constitution and the subject matter of Ark. Const. art. 16, the court concluded that the tax referenced in art. 16, &sect; 9 was limited to the property tax and did not embrace other taxes like the one percent sales and use tax adopted in the county. The court also rejected the taxpayer's allegations that the ordinances establishing the tax were not appropriately introduced, failed to have the Enactment Clause in the title, and failed to include a statutory rebate. The court found that there was substantial compliance with the statutory requirements, especially in light of the fact that the ordinances were approved by a vote of the people.</SPAN></P>

The machinery company cross-appealed a finding that the repairmen's lien statutes,&nbsp;Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18-45-201 - 18-45-207 (1987) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and dismissed the chancery court's holding that the repairmen's lien statutes (lien statutes), Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 18-45-201 - 18-45-207 (1987), were unconstitutional. The court found that federal due process was not violated because the machinery company asserted its possessory lien pursuant to the lien statutes but used no assistance from any state official in so doing. The court found no violation of state due process because the court concluded that no state action was taken in the case. The court rejected the bulldozer owner's contention that the chancery court erred in failing to award him damages for wrongful possession of the bulldozer by the machinery company because the court's holding on the issue of the lien statutes' constitutionally rendered the claim moot. Further, the court affirmed the award of damages to the machinery company, finding that the machinery company satisfied its burden of proving the reasonableness of the value of its parts and labor. Finally, the court rejected the bulldozer owner's challenge to the chancery court's jurisdiction, holding that one who invoked the assistance of equity could not later object to equity jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The information originally set out different dates. Defendant objected to the amended information. He claimed that if he had known of the new date, he could have furnished witnesses to rebut the victim's testimony. The victim testified on direct that defendant first sexually abused her sometime in February and that it occurred on the first occasion when she stayed overnight at his house. She offered no exact date, but recalled that the first incident occurred on the second day of her having first stayed at defendant's house. She thought that she had spent three nights at his house and that defendant had sex with her on the second and third nights. She then related other sexual encounters occurring months later. The court upheld the conviction. Although defendant would like to have limited the victim's claim to having first had sex with him on the date set out in the amended information, he knew that the allegations covered her first weekend stay at his house. The particular time was not an ingredient of the offense with which defendant was charged.</SPAN></P>

The police officer gave defendant a sobriety test, which defendant passed and defendant was given a warning ticket. The officer asked defendant to sign a consent to search the vehicle which defendant refused. The officer looked in the window and saw what appeared to be a marijuana cigarette in plain view. The officer confirmed it was a marijuana cigarette, placed defendant under arrest, and searched the vehicle and found 10.6 pounds of marijuana in the spare tire section of the hatchback. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the marijuana, which was denied by the trial court and defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that: (1) the search of the hatchback was incident to the lawful arrest of defendant for the marijuana the officer observed in plain view; (2) the hatchback part of the vehicle qualified as part of the passenger compartment and not the trunk; and (3) the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it failed to admit the testimony of defendant's expert who was not a chemist.</SPAN></P>

However, the court rejected the argument. The court relied on past caselaw holding that the statutes did not violate ex post facto provisions. Additionally, the court held that the statutes were not bills of attainder because they did not amount to a legislative determination of guilt and infliction of punishment on the appellant or any other identifiable individual. Additionally, the court held that the criminal trial court did not err in applying convictions more than 10 years old when sentencing the inmate under the habitual offender act because the statute made no provisions that convictions over 10 years old could not be used.</SPAN></P>

The officer smelled alcohol and administered field sobriety tests. Defendant was also given a portable breath test and, after being placed under arrest, was transported to a local hospital where a blood sample was taken. The trial court, in finding defendant guilty of underage driving while under the influence, declared the public service section of Ark.

The court found that substantial evidence supported defendant's conviction, although there was a lack of expert proof regarding the rate at which blood alcohol could be expected to dissipate over time. The trial court reasonably considered the fact that defendant's blood alcohol level at the time of testing was substantially above the allowable amount, which gave rise to an inference of some alcohol in defendant's blood at the time of arrest.

The state challenged the portion of the order that required the payment of the attorneys fees, and the counties challenged the portion of the order that required payment for indigent counsel services. The court affirmed as to the attorneys fees, but reversed as to expenses. The trial court held: (1) the legislature intended attorneys fees in cases brought under the Capital, Conflicts, and Appellate Office to be paid for by the state; (2) the legislature intended for the state to pay all expenses in cases brought under the Capital, Conflicts, and Appellate Office; and (3) the amount of the attorneys fees was reasonable, as was the amount paid in expenses.</SPAN></P>

She also filed a motion for permission to file the longer of the two petitions or, in the alternative, to file the shorter one.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1985, petitioner was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole, which was more than eight years before she tendered the instant petitions.

Her motion to file a petition longer than 10 pages was necessary because Criminal Procedure Rule 37.1(e) limited petitions to 10 pages absent leave of court. The court denied the motion to file, however, because it was clear that neither petition made any allegations sufficient to void the 1985 judgment. Petitioner argued that the jury instructions were erroneous, that the capital murder statute was vague and unconstitutional, and that her trial counsel was not effective. The court explained that none of her allegations was sufficient to show that the criminal judgment was a nullity or sufficient to void it. Thus, the court concluded that petitioner had failed to meet her burden under Rule 37 to show that the judgment was a nullity. Finally, the court explained that the presumption that a criminal judgment was final was strongest in collateral attacks against it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer was a corporation engaged in the business of billboard advertising. Its gross proceeds derived from sales of such advertising services were not taxed due to a specific exemption for advertising revenues earned by billboard companies granted by the Arkansas Gross Receipts Act of 1941 (Act). The taxpayer failed to pay use tax on certain tangible items used in its advertising business, purchased from out-of-state vendors. Appellee Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration (DFA) assessed a use tax deficiency against it, plus interest, in the amount of $ 16,367.13. The DFA assessed the use tax on certain personal property purchased out of state for storage, usage, distribution, and consumption in the state. The taxpayer paid the tax under protest, and the trial court ruled that the items were not exempt from the tax. The court affirmed the judgment and held that the taxpayer was not entitled to an exemption from the use tax because the items in question did not fall within the &quot;billboard advertising services&quot; exemption of the Act, as it did not contemplate that all tangible personal property could be purchased tax free by a billboard advertising business.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was tried prior to the effective date of a change in legislation that mandated a bifurcated process for trial and sentencing. During his trial, defendant filed a motion asking the trial court to find the new legislation unconstitutional because the bifurcation legislation was applicable to offenses occurring before the legislation's effective date. The trial court denied the motion. The first trial ended in a hung jury, and defendant was tried a second time and convicted. Defendant sought review. The court determined that defendant's motion was not timely filed and that it was properly denied. Also, there was no error in the trial court's refusal to allow the fellow student to be impeached by his prior gun theft because he had not been convicted of any crime related to the gun theft, a prerequisite under Ark.

Defendant was found guilty of refusal to submit to arrest in the circuit court where a non-jury trial was conducted. On appeal, the court affirmed the circuit court. The court found that defendant had not carried his burden of proving that &sect; 5-54-103(b)&nbsp;unconstitutionally violated his freedom of speech rights, as it was written or as it was applied in the case. The court reasoned that defendant's remedy for any violation of his constitutional rights stemming from his arrest was to submit his dispute to the impartial determination of a court of law, but not to refuse to submit to his arrest. The court found that the excluded proffer of evidence following a videotape of the event would have been cumulative or repetitious, in light of the fact that 10 witnesses had testified as to the events depicted in the videotape.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a &quot;desk audit,&quot; the Department notified the taxpayer of a proposed deficiency assessment, penalties, and interest for the 1987 tax year. The taxpayer duly filed a written protest in which an administrative law judge (ALJ) upheld the assessment. On administrative appeal, the Commissioner of Revenues did not revise the ALJ's decision and, on the Department's demand, the taxpayer paid the assessment. While that procedure was pending, the Department audited the taxpayer's 1986 return and assessed a deficiency. An ALJ upheld the assessment and, without seeking review from the Commissioner, the taxpayer paid the assessment. The taxpayer then filed its complaint in chancery court raising substantive constitutional issues as to the Department's audits and reclassification of previously nonbusiness income to business income for both the 1986 and 1987 audits. On appeal, the court ruled that the chancery court lacked jurisdiction because the taxpayer did not pay the final assessments under protest as required by Ark.

The court affirmed the convictions and the sentence. Defendant combined his challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence with his argument that the capital murder and first-degree murder statutes unconstitutionally overlapped. The court held that evidence was substantial if it was of sufficient force and character to compel reasonable minds to reach a conclusion and pass beyond suspicion and conjecture. A defendant's intent to commit murder could be inferred from the type of weapon used, and the nature, extent, and location of the wounds. Defendant also asserted that there was insufficient evidence of premeditation and deliberation to prove the capital murder charge. The court found that, in light of the testimony, the jury could have easily inferred that defendant fired multiple shots into both victims in a premeditated and deliberated manner. Also significant was a witness' testimony that defendant admitted to having planned the murders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Faulkner County Chancery Court (Arkansas), which enjoined defendant from engaging in below-cost sales and assessed damages against defendant for violation of the Arkansas Unfair Practices Act, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-201 et seq. (1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff brought suit against defendant alleging violations of the Arkansas Unfair Practices Act (the Act), Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-201 et seq. (1991), alleging that defendant was selling individual items below cost for the purpose of injuring competitors and destroying competition. The court held that for a violation to occur under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 4-75-209(a)(1), below-cost sales must have been made for the purpose of destroying competition. Mere proof of below-cost sales was not sufficient to prove violation of the Act. Defendant's sale of items below cost as loss leaders was to entice people into its store and increase traffic, as opposed to destroying competition. Defendant's isolated or occasional instances of selling below cost did not necessarily indicate a specific intent to monopolize. Defendant's practices were not sufficiently egregious to prove defendant crossed the line with regard to predatory pricing and purposeful destruction of competition.</SPAN></P>

The director argued that he was not required to determine whether the Internal Revenue Service's disallowance of the marital deduction was correct but was only required to determine the amount of the state death taxes following the federal credit. The court held that the lower court properly determined that the probate court correctly ascertained the testator's intentions and the will construction under state law and that the lower court was not bound by the decision of the Internal Revenue Service as to the construction of the will.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grandmother sought visitation with her grandson who she had raised while her daughter was in jail. The chancellor denied her request and found that the conditions of Ark.

The court held that absent a statutory provision granting it, a grandparent had no right of visitation with a grandchild. The statute limited its operation to cases in which a marital relationship between the parents of the child had been severed or if the child was in the custody or under the guardianship of a person other than one or both of his natural or adoptive parents. Neither of those situations existed. The court concluded that &sect; 9-13-103 was not unconstitutional. The grandmother failed to show that a classification differentiating grandparents of legitimate children and grandparents of illegitimate children was arbitrary and capricious for which there was no legitimate government purpose. Her due process rights were not violated because she did not have a legal right to see her grandchild that would have afforded her the right to a hearing.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Three lawsuits involving a constitutional amendment prohibiting the use of public funds for abortions, Ark.

The trial court issued a permanent injunction against the medical school that placed limitations on the abortions that could be performed there by restricting them to those privately paid for but did not accept the more expansive interpretation of the amendment that was advanced by the activists. The activists appealed, and the court affirmed the trial court's decision dismissing the program as a party and dismissing a request to have &quot;mother's life&quot; defined.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The referred act was to be placed on the general election ballot for approval, but the citizen claimed that its title was misleading and contained a fatal omission. The citizen's challenge to the title involved its reference to the disposition of the revenues generated by the tax. The court held that pursuant to Ark. Const. amend 7, the referred act was held in abeyance from the date the initial petition for referendum was filed. Therefore amendments made by the General Assembly during the referendum proceedings were held in abeyance and were not considered by the court when evaluating the sufficiency of the ballot title. Consequently, there was nothing omitted from the ballot title that would have given a voter serious ground for reflection when voting on the soft drink tax, nor were statements contained therein which would have had a tendency to mislead the voter on the issue presented.</SPAN></P>

Appellee mother claimed that one child would not graduate from high school until after reaching 18, and the father claimed that Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-12-312(a)(5)(A) (Repl. 1993), the statute authorizing support past 18, was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Section 9-12-312(a)(5)(A) authorized trial courts to provide support beyond age 18 to address the child's educational needs when the child's birthday fell before high school graduation, conditioned on the child remaining in school. The father claimed that the statute unfairly took the decision to support children after they reached majority from noncustodial parents, while married and custodial parents retained the option. On review, the court found that a high school diploma was of almost inestimable value to a young person seeking to make her own living, that the public interest extended to the child's welfare, and that minimal interference with the &quot;right&quot; to stop supporting a child was warranted by the state's interest in seeing the child obtain at least a high school education. By analogy to decisions from other states, the court found that the statute was designed to meet a specific and limited problem that existed only when a home was split by divorce, and that the differences in the circumstances between married and divorced parents established the necessity to discriminate between the classes.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court convicted defendant after a jury trial of promoting obscene materials. Defendant then requested that she be sentenced as a first time offender under 1975 Ark. Acts 346, which permitted an accused to plead guilty or nolo contendere, receive probation, and later have the record expunged. The lower court denied the request and the court affirmed. Defendant claimed that state law did not provide similar expunction relief for her because she exercised her right to a jury trial, she urged that the denial of her request encourage guilty pleas and violated her constitutional rights. The court rejected her theory and affirmed the decision of the lower court. Under Ark. Code &sect; 5-4-301(d) the lower court should not have entered a conviction against her if she complied with her conditions of probation. The defendant received probation so no conviction judgment should have been entered so she would have been entitled later to be discharged and have all the proceedings dismissed, but defendant failed to object to the entry of her judgment of conviction and in so failing, lost that relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee doctors filed a motion seeking a stay of an order from the Pulaski County Chancery Court (Arkansas), which issued an injunction that prohibited a university hospital from performing abortions other than to save the life of the mother unless the procedure was paid for by the mother or a third-party provider. Appellant Unborn Child Amendment Committee (committee) had sought a more expansive restriction pursuant to Ark. Const. amend. 68.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The committee alleged that the university hospital was in violation of Ark. Const. amend. 68 by performing abortions for any reason other than to save the mother's life. The trial court rejected the committee's interpretation but imposed a preliminary injunction over use of public funds to pay for abortions for any other purpose than to save the mother's life. Subsequently, the federal district court determined that amend. 68 was null and void as being in conflict with a federal law. The doctors filed a motion to stay the order and injunction previously issued pending an appeal of the federal court decision. The court initially denied the request to remove oral arguments, but thereafter, ordered that the matter be stayed, as well as staying the provisions of the preliminary injunction. The court noted that until such time as the federal court's determination was decided on appeal, the hospital would have to deal with competing injunctions. The hospital could not comply with both injunctions and accordingly, the instant action's injunction required that it be stayed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the doctors' motion to stay the order and preliminary injunction against performance of certain abortions by the university hospital pending the outcome of a federal appeal in a similar action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged a judgment of the Circuit Court of Pulaski County, Arkansas, which convicted him of rape, kidnapping, and breaking or entering. He challenged the sufficiency of the evidence for his kidnapping conviction, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-11-102(a)(4) (Repl. 1993), and argued that the application of Arkansas's new bifurcation sentencing laws, Acts 535 and 551 of 1993, violated his constitutional protections against ex-post facto laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, the court noted that defense counsel made an oral motion before trial challenging the constitutionality of the new sentencing laws, which was overruled, and filed a written motion just 10 minutes before the trial court began the sentencing phase. The record did not show that the trial court saw the written motion or ruled on it. The written motion contained several constitutional arguments, including the ex post facto issue, that were not part of the oral motion. Where, as here, an appellant's argument at trial did not apprise the trial court of the arguments made on appeal, the court would not reach the arguments. The court held that the state's evidence was sufficient to support defendant's kidnapping conviction. To prove kidnapping, the state had to show that an accused restrained the victim, so as to interfere substantially with her liberty, with the purpose of inflicting physical injury upon her or of engaging in sexual contact with her. The evidence showed that defendant raped the victim twice while holding a gun to her head and that he sat on her bed for two hours between each act of rape. For two hours, the victim's freedom to leave was substantially impaired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor, driving while intoxicated, first offense, under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-65-103 (1987). On appeal from a municipal court conviction, the trial de novo in the trial court was held before a six-person jury pursuant to Act 592 of 1993, codified at Ark. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 16-32-202 and 16-32-203 (Repl. 1994), subject to defendant's objections. He was again convicted. On appeal, the court held that Act 592 was void because it violated Article 2, &sect; 7 of the Arkansas Constitution. The court found that &quot;jury&quot; has always meant a 12-person panel, and the number of jurors permitted on a jury could only be changed by a vote of the people. The standard of 12 people on criminal juries was intended under the constitution. This was particularly shown where, by a vote of the people, the constitution was amended to permit smaller juries for civil cases only. As such amendment did not include criminal juries, Act 592 was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

The undercover agent, who was not the arresting officer, could testify even though he was not certified. Omission of the undercover agent's uncertified status and prior misconduct did not render the probable cause affidavit's contents false because these were not material circumstances and the affiant was unaware of them. Dismissal for prosecutorial discovery misconduct was not warranted because defendant received the information long before trial. Defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by exclusion of extrinsic evidence of prior misconduct, which proved no more than the undercover agent's admission on cross-examination. Refusal to grant a mistrial was not an abuse of discretion because the admonition to disregard cured the statement that defendant was &quot;the big man in town.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Defendant became disgruntled when he was allegedly accused of burning a building, and the victim's wife allegedly persuaded his wife to leave him. Defendant bound and beat the victim, stabbed him in the back, cut through his face from mouth to ear, and shot him in the chest and head. The court found that a tee-shirt was erroneously admitted; there was no proof on how, when, or where defendant came to possess it, only that he was carrying it three days after the murder; there was no proof that he subscribed to its slogan; and the prosecuting attorney argued about it at length in closing argument. The court held that admitting the shirt was clearly prejudicial and an abuse of discretion; however, evidence of guilt was overwhelming, so the error was harmless. The court observed that it was error to refuse mitigating testimony by defendant's jailer and to admit hearsay about a reversed conviction. The court concluded that defendant had to be resentenced, although the statutory aggravating circumstance applied and was properly presented to the jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for capital murder, but it held there was prejudicial error in the sentencing phase of the bifurcated trial. The court vacated the death sentence and remanded for resentencing, instructing the trial court not to allow the tee-shirt or hearsay into evidence.</SPAN></P>

The state offered evidence that defendant was convicted of a separate murder that occurred after the murders at issue. When the jury returned with its verdicts, the trial court noted a defect in the verdict forms and, off the record, corrected the defect for the jury foreperson. Defendant sought a continuance prior to the resentencing due in part to the fact that the state provided defendant 17 days before trial a list of 30 witnesses. Defendant sought to disqualify the prosecutor's office because a future prosecutor had represented defendant. The court held that &sect; 5-4-604(3) allowed admission of a felony committed after the killings at issue and which resulted in conviction before sentencing. There was no abuse of discretion in denying the continuance. There was no evidence of prejudice. As to the disqualification motion, defendant was obliged to have raised the issue in his earlier appeals. No error occurred in the trial court's assistance to the foreperson.

Defendant objected to the chancellor's status as the trial judge. The trial court denied the motion to transfer the matter to the jurisdiction of a duly elected circuit judge. On appeal, defendant contended that, through the passage of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-2803 (Repl. 1994), the General Assembly intended to void the exchange agreements authorized by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-13-403 (Repl. 1994), and thus, the chancellor could not legally preside over criminal actions until 1997. He also argued that &sect; 16-13-403 permitted chancellors to discharge particular judicial duties which they were not elected to perform. The court concluded the arguments were not presented to the trial court and were not preserved for appeal.

Defendant failed to demonstrate that the legislature's decision to vest prosecuting attorneys with the discretion to bring felony charges against 16-year-olds in circuit courts was arbitrary or irrational. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion by granting the State's motion to hold an additional hearing on the motion to transfer and by admitting various items into evidence at that hearing. The court concluded that the circuit court rightly reviewed all the factors enumerated in Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-318(e) (1993) and found that the seriousness of the offense and the violence employed outweighed the other factors.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On April 7, 1993, the patient filed a medical malpractice action against the doctor, alleging that the doctor rendered negligent medical care between April 1988 and February 7, 1991. As the final date on which the patient alleged negligence, February 7, 1991, became, for the purposes of the lawsuit, the date of the accrual of the cause of action, the statute of limitations ran from that date. The patient contended that the statute of limitations was controlled by Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-204 (Supp. 1993) and that as she filed her notice of intent to sue on January 8, 1993, thus extending the time for commencement of the action by 90 days, her suit was timely brought. The trial court dismissed the suit as untimely. The court had, in a prior case, held that Ark. R. Civ. P. 3 directly conflicted with and superseded Ark.

Code Ann. &sect; 16-114-204(a) was superseded in its application rendered the entire statute superseded. As the suit was not timely pursuant to Ark.

Defendant claimed that the photographic lineup was impermissibly suggestive and that there was not sufficient evidence to support the convictions.

The court held that it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that when defendant pointed the gun at the customer, the employee was included in the threat communicated by defendant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court had ruled that the reassessment plan violated Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 14. On appeal, the court held that while it would have liked to reach the merits of the trial court's rulings, it was impossible to do so because the trial court had no subject-matter jurisdiction of the matter. A court of equity could grant relief against a void or illegal tax assessment, but if the taxes complained of were not themselves illegal, a suit for illegal exaction would not lie. Unquestionably, the ad valorem property taxes assessed were authorized by law under the Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 5. The taxpayer did not object to the actual valuations or tax formula used to calculate the taxes. Instead, it contended only that the reassessment and tax collection scheme used by the county tax collectors to collect those legal ad valorem taxes was unconstitutional. In other words, the taxpayer effectually questioned only the reassessment procedure or plan employed by the county assessor and collector as being a flawed one. Because the case did not involve a void or illegal tax assessment, the trial court was without power to hear the matter.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Arkansas voters enacted Ark. Const. amend. 73, which imposed term limits on federal and state elected officials. The trial court found amendment 73 unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed in part and affirmed in part. The court held that there was a justiciable controversy and held that appellees had standing to bring an action on behalf of certain candidates and voters for those candidates. The court held that Ark. Const. amend. 7 did not require an enacting clause for statewide initiated petitions to amend the state constitution. The term limits imposed on United States senators and representatives violated the qualification clauses of U.S. Const. art 1, &sect; 2, cl. 2 and U.S. Const. art 1, &sect; 3, cl. 3 because states could not impose additional qualifications on United States senators and representatives. The term limits imposed on state officials were constitutional and the provisions imposing those term limits were severable from the unconstitutional provisions of the amendment. The court held that only periods of service commencing after the enactment of the amendment would be counted as a term for limitation purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee owners sued appellants, a municipal water and sewer improvement district and its commissioners, for a declaration that all assessments against their property were void, to recover a refund of taxes paid, to enjoin future assessments, and other relief. Appellants counterclaimed to foreclose for delinquent taxes. The Pulaski County Chancery Court (Arkansas) entered a judgment for the owners. Appellants sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because the owners needed water and sewer services before they could market their property, they and others formed the district to provide such services. The district issued bonds, the proceeds of which were to be used to build sewer and water lines. A special improvement tax was imposed upon the assessments. The owners paid the assessments without protest until a federal agent advised them that parts of the property were &quot;wetlands,&quot; which were not subject to development without a permit under applicable federal regulations. Appellants refused the owners' request to reduce the assessment because to do so would have caused the total assessed benefits to fall below the amount of assessments pledged as security for the bonds. On appeal, the court held that the chancellor erred in ruling that the owners were entitled to recover because the federal regulations constituted a material physical change in the property. Not only was the regulation in effect before the initial assessment, the ruling retroactively allowed relief for taxes paid. Even if there were a material change in the property, it was improper to lower the amount of benefits assessed given the district's indebtedness.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the chancellor's judgment and remanded the case to the chancellor for further proceedings, in which the chancellor was to determine the amount of penalties and interest on delinquent assessments in order to order foreclosure the property if the taxes, penalty, and interest were not paid.</SPAN></P>

The landlord received a judgment, and he subsequently garnished the tenant's bank and his mother, and as a result, found that the bank held a certificate of deposit in the name of the mother as trustee for the son. The municipal court held a hearing and testimony showed that the certificate of deposit had been purchased by proceeds payable to the tenant under his deceased father's life insurance policy. The municipal court ruled that the landlord was entitled to seize the proceeds because Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-66-209 (1987) had been declared unconstitutional. The lower court reversed on the basis that the insurance proceeds had been placed in trust and were subject to spendthrift provisions that protected them from garnishment. The court reversed the lower court, stating that a spendthrift trust could have only been created by an express restraint on alienation. A mere trusteeship was not to be called a spendthrift trust. The tenant failed to produce evidence showing evidence of any will or with a trust provision or any trust agreement. The insurance policy also was not offered as evidence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The patient created a trust for her support. However, the trustee's power to pay her maintenance was suspended if the patient was placed in a nursing home. The patient subsequently entered a nursing home. Her application for Medicaid benefits was approved. However, those payments were suspended after the department learned of the trust. An appeals officer upheld that decision. The trial court reversed the department's decision and required the state to reimburse the patient's trust. The department appealed from the trial court's judgment, which was reversed. The matter was remanded.  Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-69-102 (Supp. 1993), which became effective after the trial court's judgment, prohibited trusts that suspended payment in the event that long-term nursing care was needed. The court concluded that &sect; 28-69-102 was to be applied retroactively. In that regard, the court noted that Medicaid was intended to be the payor of last resort. Furthermore, a retroactive application of &sect; 28-69-102 did not arbitrarily interfere with vested rights because that construction was consistent with both public policy concerns and elementary considerations of fairness and justice.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two school districts entered into the agreement by which the district was created. The agreement provided that three school board members were to be selected from one consolidating district and that three members were to be selected from the other consolidating district. Two years later, the legislature passed &sect; 6-13-615, which provided a local option for the election of school board directors from single-member zones. Pursuant to that statute, a petition was filed to place a proposal on the ballot for the annual school election for dividing the district into six zones for the purpose of electing board members. The election proceeded and single-member districts were approved. On appeal, the court held that the circuit court erred in invalidating the election on the ground that &sect; 6-13-615 impaired the contractual rights under the agreement. U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10, and Ark. Const. art. 2, &sect; 17, which forbade the enactment of any law impairing the obligation of contracts, applied only to laws affecting private contracts. Because the agreement was between two school districts and provided for the establishment of the district, it was a public contract subject to legislative action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, a bishop and four reverends, sought review of the order of the Sebastian County Circuit Court (Arkansas), which rendered judgment in favor of appellee, also a reverend, in his claims for tortious interference in a business expectancy against the four reverends, for defamation against one of the four reverends, and for promissory estoppel against the bishop.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The basis of the reverend's claims were that the four reverends induced the bishop to decline to appoint the reverend to a church as pastor, as the bishop had promised. He further alleged that he expended money in reasonable reliance upon the bishop's promise. The trial court entered judgment for the reverend as stated above. The court reversed and dismissed the judgment, holding that the claim for tortious interference with a business expectancy was not a personal injury action, as the trial court had held, because it did not involve corporeal injury. Therefore, venue did not lie in the county where the alleged injury occurred. Because the four reverends were non-residents, it was error not to grant their motion to dismiss for lack of venue on that claim. The defamation claim was also not a personal injury claim, and venue again did not lie in the county where the alleged action occurred. Thus, it also should have been dismissed for lack of venue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owners' property was located within a commercial zone. They used only part of the property for commercial purposes; the other part of the property consisted of a residential duplex that the owners rented out. The county tax assessor based its valuation of the owners' property only on comparable sales of nearby commercial properties. The owners argued that the assessor should have evaluated the property by comparable sales of residential property and that comparable sales of commercial properties should not have been used because that would only project the property's value for future use, and not its current, actual use. On appeal, the court held that the current use of the property was one factor to be considered in making an assessment. That factor had to be considered in connection with other factors, some of which included the character of the land and its development. Using only the property's current use would not yield a true market value as required by Ark. Const. art. 16, &sect; 5. Because the residential use of the owners' property did not reflect its true market value due to its situs in a commercial zone, current usage did not greatly influence actual market value.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Subsequent to his conviction for capital murder, the inmate argued, pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-90-111 (Sup. 1991) that the sentence imposed on him was facially illegal because the definition of capital murder overlapped the statutory definition of first-degree murder, that the prosecutor had too much discretion in deciding whom to charge with capital murder, and that the trial court failed to properly instruct the jury. Reviewing the record, the court dismissed the appeal after finding that the inmate's claims were wholly without merit. The court held that the capital murder statute was not rendered unconstitutional by any overlap with the first-degree murder statute. Additionally, the court held that the allegations were directed at the validity of the judgment rather than the sentence and thus could not be challenged under &sect; 16-90-111, which provided a narrow remedy for correction of a facially illegal sentence.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5-65-202, 5-65-205, he appealed to the Washington Circuit Court, Arkansas, which, after holding a de novo bench trial, found him guilty of both offenses.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendant refused an officer's request to submit to a chemical test, the officer gave defendant a consent form, which stated that the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that defendant was driving while intoxicated and that he had asked defendant to take a chemical test. The form stated that if defendant refused the test and a trial court later determined that the officer had probable cause to require him to take the test, then his license could be suspended. Defendant signed the form. When he appeared in the circuit court, his attorney formally waived any requirement of a jury trial in the matter. The record showed that the circuit court asked counsel whether it was correct that defendant had waived his right to a jury trial. Counsel responded that the circuit court was correct. On appeal, the court held that because the record showed that counsel waived defendant's right to a jury trial in open court and in his presence, defendant was bound by the waiver. There was no merit to defendant's claim that the form was inadequate to inform him of the consequences of refusing to take the test. He stated that he knew his license might be suspended if he refused the test.</SPAN></P>

Appellants argued that this power of appointment violated the separation of powers provision found in Ark. Const. art. 4. The trial court granted summary judgment to appellees, and appellants sought review. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 6 of the Standards of Conduct and Disclosure Act for Candidates and Political Campaigns did not violate separation of powers as set out in Ark. Const. art. 4. The court disagreed with appellees' argument that the ethics commission was quasi-judicial in nature, stating that under Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 7-6-218(b)(4) the only actions that the commission could take upon finding a violation was to issue a public letter of warning or to make proper recommendations to the law enforcement authorities. Thus, the commission lacked the power to make or enforce any orders, and the chief justice's appointment power did not violate separation of powers.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The claimants closed two real estate transactions with decedent, but were not apprised of his death until demand was made on the claimants for payment on a property. On appeal, the court held that the probate court properly denied the claims against the estate. Specifically, the court stated that it could not say on the basis of the record that the probate court erred in finding that the claimants were afforded an opportunity to present evidence on their claim, but forfeited that opportunity. As a result, the court rejected the claimants' contention that they were denied an evidentiary hearing and the chance to make a record on their claims. Similarly, the court rejected the claimants' contention that they were reasonably ascertainable creditors who were not given actual notice by the administratrix and that a two-year statute of limitations applied, pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-50-101(h) (Supp. 1991). Instead, the court held, in part, that it was not prepared to conclude that the legislature intended for all estates to be two years in duration because of the potential that additional claims might come to light subsequent to the nonclaim period.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the main issue of the complaint was the constitutionality of &sect; 23-18-101 and that the PSC was without jurisdiction. the PSC, as an administrative agency, was vested with quasi-judicial powers to determine some incidental questions of law but lacked authority to determine issues based solely on constitutional claims.

The court found that: (1) the jury was composed of persons who could decide the case on the testimony presented and not on the basis of media coverage of two unrelated cases; (2) Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 5-4-603(a) and Ark. Model Jury Instruction Crim. &sect; 1509 were framed to lead the jury adequately through the death penalty sentencing process and thus, there was no uncertainty in the minds of the jurors of the procedures to be followed and of the consequences; (3) two jurors were properly not removed for cause as any uncertainties that might have arisen from their voir dire responses were cured by rehabilitative questions; and (4) double counting of the aggravating circumstances was not significant as the statutory scheme genuinely narrowed the class of death eligibles and thus was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant contended that the trial court erred in failing to find the second individual an accomplice as a matter of law. Under settled law, defendant bore the burden of proving that a witness was an accomplice whose testimony had to have been corroborated. At trial, defendant actually made this argument in the form of a motion to dismiss for failure to corroborate an accomplice's testimony. However, defendant failed to obtain a ruling on this issue. The court held that defendant was procedurally barred from raising the issue because he failed to secure a ruling on the issue.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The car owner failed to renew his car license for two and one-half months after its expiration at the end of the year. After signing an affidavit that he had not operated his car during that time period, the state official waived the penalty for failing to timely renew the license. The state official, however, renewed the license only until the end of the next year. The car owner contended that his renew should have been extended two and one-half months or that he should have gotten a refund for that period. The car owner brought this action for illegal exaction against the state officials and contested the dismissal of his complaint. The court affirmed. Because the car owner did not argue that the Ark.

Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-330(5), (6) (Supp. 1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">DHS argued that it was not a custodian of juveniles in its care and even if it was a custodian, sovereign immunity protected it against assessment of the costs and restitution awards in actions it did not initiate. The court held that DHS was a custodian because DHS had been given custody of the juveniles in each case. The court explained that it was clearly wrong for the trial court to assess a probation fee against DHS because Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 9-27-303(9) did not authorize the assessment of a probation fee against a custodian. The court noted that the doctrine of sovereign immunity precluded the assessment of costs and restitution against DHS because while no action, in the traditional sense, had been brought against the state, the state would have been coerced to bear the financial obligation to pay the costs and restitution if the orders were upheld. The court concluded that any action, whether in law or equity, which had for its purpose and effect, directly or indirectly, coerced the state, was one against the state. The court determined that DHS did not voluntarily waive sovereign immunity because it was under an obligation to appear in the delinquency proceedings.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted the State's motion to dismiss and held that the pro se motions were moot. The court held that defendant's appeal from the denial of post-conviction relief was dismissed because it was clear that it was meritless. Arkansas Code Annotated &sect; 16-90-111 (Supp. 1991) provided a narrow remedy whereby a trial court could correct an illegal sentence at any time and could correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner within one-hundred-and-twenty days after a defendant had entered a plea of guilty. The court held that defendant did not file his petition in the trial court until more than six years after he pleaded guilty and the sentences were imposed. After the one-hundred-twenty day period for filing a petition elapsed, relief was not available under the statute unless defendant demonstrated that the sentence imposed was illegal on its face. Defendant did not make such a showing. Furthermore, the court held that because the aggregate sentence imposed on defendant did not render any sentence or sentences imposed facially invalid, he was entitled to no relief under the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The incident occurred in the Benton County of the Springdale, Arkansas city limits. The issue was whether Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-17-206(b)(2)(Supp. 1991) was unconstitutional. The court issued a writ of prohibition to prevent the municipal court from exercising jurisdiction over the criminal offense committed in Benton County. Section 16-17-206(b)(2) provided that the jurisdiction of municipal courts had to be enlarged to include portions of the city limits that extended into other counties. The legislature could neither enlarge nor diminish the jurisdiction of the courts except as permitted by the Arkansas Constitution and any attempt to do so was unconstitutional. The jurisdiction of Arkansas municipal courts was concurrent and no greater than jurisdiction of the Arkansas justice of the peace courts. When Article 7, &sect;&sect; 40, 43 of the Arkansas Constitution and Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-19-401(a) (1987) were read together, it was obvious that the jurisdiction of a municipal court was confined to the county in which it was situated. Therefore, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 16-17-206(b)(2)(Supp. 1991) was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The DHS filed a report of substantiated credible child abuse by the principal. After unsuccessful administrative appeals, the principal appealed to the trial court, which found that the allegation was unsubstantiated, and which ordered the expungement of the principal's name from the registry based on the unconstitutionality of Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 12-12-505 (Supp. 1991), requiring that unsubstantiated allegations be retained for three years. The court reversed the decision, holding first that the statute was not discretionary because the legislature repealed an earlier law requiring immediate expungement of such claims. The trial court's inability to order the expungement did not violate the separation of powers, as the statute limited disclosure of the record. The principal had no protectible property interest in his reputation to implicate due process. The DHS's rationally based need to establish a pattern of abuse where single incidents did not rise to the level of substantiated abuse overcame equal protection arguments. And safeguards in the statutory scheme overcame a privacy argument.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant infant sought review of a judgment from the Faulkner Probate Court, Second Division (Arkansas), which set aside a temporary guardianship order and required appellee grandparents to give custody of the infant to his mother. Despite having been granted custody of her child, the mother appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the temporary guardianship law, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-65-218 (Supp. 1991).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The infant was placed under the temporary guardianship of his grandparents, who had filed an ex parte emergency order for such. The probate court later granted the mother's motion to set aside the order. The mother filed an appeal, contending that the temporary guardianship law, Ark. Code Ann. &sect; 28-65-218 (Supp. 1991), was unconstitutional. The court held that the mother's complaints regarding the probate court's initial order were moot. The court recognized that the issue of whether &sect; 28-65-218 was constitutional was &quot;capable of repetition yet evading review&quot; because a temporary guardianship lasted only 90 days, therefore making it unlikely that the issue would ever reach appeal. However, the probate court had not rendered a decision as to the constitutionality of &sect; 28-65-218. Thus, the court, which had appellate jurisdiction only under Ark. Const. art.
