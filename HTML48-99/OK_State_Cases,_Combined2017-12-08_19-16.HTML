Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1283, and robbery with firearms after former conviction of two or more felonies, in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 801.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant robbed a convenience store and shot and killed he clerk. When he was interviewed and arraigned, defendant confessed. He was convicted of first degree murder, feloniously carrying a firearm, and robbery with firearms after former conviction of two or more felonies. Defendant was sentenced to death, ten years, and life imprisonment, respectively. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for a new trial. In reaching its decision, the court held that defendant's videotaped confession was inadmissible because he had not waived his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to counsel. The court further held that the admission of the confession was not harmless error. Also, the court held that the trial court's failure to instruct on the lesser included noncapital offenses was not harmless because, even if the jury found that defendant's PCP intoxication prevented him from forming the specific intent necessary for murder, it had no option but to acquit or convict defendant of first degree murder. Finally, the court held that the information did not adequately allege each element of first degree murder under malice, felony murder, or both, as required by law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the judgment of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which after a jury trial, convicted him of first degree malice aforethought murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, larceny of an automobile, first degree rape, and forcible anal sodomy. He also challenged the sentence of death imposed after the second phase of the bifurcated trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In challenging his conviction and sentence, defendant raised 34 claims of error, many of which the court found were either waived by his failure to object during trial or which did not satisfy the plain error standard for reversal. With respect to errors which had not been waived, the court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's admission of an autopsy photograph of the victim because the photograph was relevant and its probative value was not outweighed by its potential for prejudice. The court found that the Oklahoma rape shield statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2412 (1992), was applicable though the victim was dead. Given that and the fact that consent was not an issue in the case, the court found that the trial court did not err in prohibiting defendant from cross-examining a witness who dated the victim about his sexual relations with her. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict and that because defendant claimed he was innocent of the murder, he was not entitled to a jury instruction on lesser-included offenses. The court found no error in either the jury instructions or the presentation of evidence during the sentencing phase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a decision by the District Court of Comanche County (Oklahoma), which convicted him of murder in the first degree in violation of Okla. Code Crim. P., Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.7 (1981); shooting with intent to kill in violation of Okla. Code Crim. P., Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 652 (1981); and attempted shooting with intent to kill in violation of Okla. Code Crim. P., Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 652 (1981). He was sentenced to death.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant murdered three bank employees during a bank robbery. He also killed a bank customer and severely wounded other customers. During the incident, defendant also shot at an infant, who was not killed because defendant was out of bullets. On appeal, the court affirmed the convictions and sentences. The court first found that the State of Oklahoma's impression that one juror would be sympathetic to defendant's religious beliefs was a legitimate, race-neutral reason to strike the juror. There were no other jury selection errors. The court next found that evidence of what defendant did within the three days after the robbery and murders was admissible because it was so closely-related to the robbery and murders as to form a logical connection. As to the sentencing, the court determined that the admission of testimony from the victims' relatives did not deny defendant his right to a fair sentencing proceeding under Okla. Code Crim. P., Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 984, 984.1, 991a(C). Finally, a finding that the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel was supported by the evidence because of the extreme mental anguish suffered by the bank employees prior to their deaths.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the trial judge erred in admitting photographs of his girlfriend's body and a tape recording of her emergency telephone call made during the attack and in refusing to give an instruction on first degree manslaughter. The court upheld defendant's conviction and the sentence imposed. The court ruled that (1) the probative value of the photographs outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice because the number of the wounds depicted tended to support the state's theory that the murders were premeditated; (2) the recording from the telephone call had no probative value, but its admission was harmless because there was overwhelming evidence of defendant's guilt; and (3) the refusal to give a first degree manslaughter instruction was proper because the evidence did not support such an instruction and defendant's theory of defense was that he committed second-degree murder rather than first-degree murder.</SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the lower court erred in denying his application to withdraw his plea and in imposing the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of painting without having a license in violation of &sect; 2906.1. Defendant appealed the conviction arguing that the city ordinance was unconstitutional. The court agreed and reversed the conviction. The court held that &sect; 2906.1, as it applied to sign painters, was unconstitutional. Further, the court held that Tulsa City, Okla., Ordinance tit. 51, &sect; 201.0 as it applied to sign painters was unconstitutional and Tulsa City, Okla., Ordinance tit. 51, &sect; 2901.5, insofar as it required a license for sign painters in addition to a permit was unconstitutional. The court held while the city had authority to establish license requirements, there had to be an obvious and real connection between the requirements and its purpose of protecting the public welfare. The court found that the city could not justify how requiring a sign painter to have both a license and permit enhanced the public welfare. The right to acquire the means of supporting life by honest labor and skill was an inherent right of a citizen. The court found that the vocation of painting signs did not imply any sinister influence on the public calling for municipal surveillance in the form of a license.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In rejecting defendant's claim that his confession was involuntary, the court found no evidence that defendant was misled into believing that an investigator was &quot;on his side.&quot; The court also found that defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his previously asserted right to silence when he initiated further conversation with the police and indicated a willingness and desire for further discussion about the investigation. The admission of certain irrelevant and prejudicial evidence did not contribute to the verdict or sentence and was, therefore, harmless error. Defendant affirmatively, voluntarily, and knowingly waived his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights which otherwise barred the use of evidence obtained in his competency hearing. The court rejected defendant's challenges to the second-stage jury instructions addressing both aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Given the strong evidence against defendant, the prosecutor's improper appeal to religious bias in the jurors was harmless error. The sentence met the tests set forth in the court's mandatory sentence review required by Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.13(C) (Supp. 1985).</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not question that the child had been sodomized. He introduced evidence that he did not commit the act, pointed to another possible culprit, and denied being the perpetrator. Defendant argued, in part, that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation when a videotaped interview between the child and a detective was played for the jury and that the trial court erred in allowing the jury to hear testimony and see demonstrations using anatomically correct dolls because the evidence did not meet the Frye standard for scientific reliability. Affirming the judgment, the court held that the harmless-error analysis applied to constitutional errors in the trial process, as opposed to structural defects that affected the framework within which a trial proceeded. The court found that admission of the videotape was a trial error and that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, given the overwhelming properly admitted evidence that defendant was the culprit. The court determined that the dolls were demonstrative, not scientific, evidence because they were offered for illustrative purposes only and that they possessed the required degree of representational accuracy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim did not pay defendant money owed under a property contract, leading to foreclosure proceedings. The victim was shot five times. Remanding for resentencing, the court said that reversible error occurred when the trial court did not instruct the jury on all sentencing options. Life without parole was available. The trial court committed reversible error when it did not consider that option, notwithstanding the fact that the statute for the option did not become effective until after the date of the crime. Affirming the conviction, the court said that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court properly refused to move the trial. Defendant did not show prejudice by clear and convincing evidence to justify reversing the denial of a motion for a change of venue. A fair jury was selected. Defendant failed to show that the selection process had been tainted by media coverage. Ample evidence supported a finding that an arrest had been properly grounded in probable cause. The court did not agree that counsel was ineffective for failing to move for the suppression of the arrest and its effects.</SPAN></P>

The question was certified to the court pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect;&sect; 1601-1611. Upon review, the court determined that mandamus provided a vehicle for inmates to ensure due process was provided within the department disciplinary system. Further, the court determined that habeas corpus was the plenary remedy for the inmates to adjudicate a right to release based on the amount of time served coupled with the net earned credits awarded. Additionally, the court determined that Okla. Stat. tit. 75, &sect; 250.4, provided a specific exception to the general rule mandating judicial review of administrative appeals, which exception excluded judicial review of an administrative decision by the departments to grant or revoke earned credits. Therefore, the court held that state law did not provide an appeal from the departments' actions on discipline.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot at several men, and killed one, when they denied that defendant's daughter lived at her home. The jury convicted defendant of first degree murder and sentenced him to death after finding two aggravating circumstances, that defendant posed a continuing threat to society and that he knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person. On appeal, the court upheld defendant's murder conviction. However, as required by Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.13(C) (1987), the court considered whether the death sentence was imposed under any arbitrary factor and whether the evidence supported the jury's finding of the aggravating circumstances. Pursuant to this review, the court held that a 19-year-old information charging defendant with a shooting was insufficient evidence to uphold the &quot;continuing threat&quot; aggravator because such evidence, without more, failed to establish that defendant had a history of criminal conduct that was likely to continue. The court then determined that the mitigating evidence outweighed the remaining aggravating circumstance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State challenged an order of the District Court of Carter County (Oklahoma) that sustained defendant's objection as to the State's intent, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1175.2(B)(3) (1981), to require defendant to testify at the pre-trial hearing that was held to determine if defendant was competent to stand trial as to the criminal charges that the State filed against him.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's objection was sustained on the bases that tit. 22, &sect; 1175.2(B)(3) was unconstitutional on its face and as applied that Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1175(4)(D) (1981) also unconstitutionally violated defendant's right against self-incrimination because tit. 22, &sect; 1175(4)(D) only provided for use immunity. The court reversed the order that sustained defendant's objection and remanded for further proceedings that were consistent with the court's opinion. Although Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1175.5 et seq. (1981) were civil in nature, the Fifth Amendment right against compulsory self-incrimination extended to both criminal and civil proceedings. However, the 1985 amendment, which allowed using a statement of a person who was found to have competent at the time of his or her examination hearing for impeachment purposes, to Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1175.4(D) (1981) had the fatal constitutional flaw of not leaving an accused and the State in substantially the same positions as if the accused had claimed the Fifth Amendment privilege. The court ordered the severance of that unconstitutional clause from the rest of tit. 22, &sect; 1175.4(D).</SPAN></P>

Defendant and a co-defendant beat the victim at the victim's home and then took him, in his truck to a remote location. They then set the victim and his truck on fire. The court rejected defendant's contention that the trial court erred in denying his repeated requests for a trial separate from that of his co-defendant. The court concluded that defendant's defense was not mutually antagonistic with that of his co-defendant because defendant did not attempt to exculpate himself by inculpating his co-defendant. The court also rejected defendant's contention that he was denied effective assistance of counsel by counsel's failure to present evidence crucial to his defense. Specifically, defendant contended that defense counsel failed to deliver on her opening statement promise of producing evidence to show that the victim's wife had solicited other young men to kill her husband. The court concluded that it could not say that defense counsel's decision not to call the individuals was not a tactical decision, professionally reasonable under the circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the case arose when two white police officers went to a housing project to arrest two black males for an unrelated offense. The court noted that a crowd gathered at the site of the arrest and defendant began speaking to the crowd, using profanity, telling the officers they were unwelcome, and urging the officers to leave. The court found that defendant was arrested after he raised a clenched fist at the officers. The court noted that the trial court did not consider the evidence in light of the clear and present danger test and refused to give defendant's requested instruction on constitutionally protected speech. The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial, holding that in each prosecution under the anti-riot statute, the trial court was required to instruct the jury that they had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's conduct created a clear and present danger of imminent unlawful action.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.7 (1981), and the evidence did not warrant instructions on second-degree murder, second-degree manslaughter, or misdemeanor-manslaughter; (4) testimony regarding prior abuse of the victim established the necessary requirements for child abuse and although it may have consisted of evidence of other crimes, it was properly admissible at trial; and (5) the State's provision of a list of witnesses and a detailed list of evidence to show aggravating circumstances complied with Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant in an Oklahoma death penalty case sought reconsideration of the dismissal of his application for post-conviction relief, and requested reinstatement of his appeal and a stay of execution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Following the court's order dismissing defendant's application for post-conviction relief, defendant moved for reconsideration. He argued that the court in its order misstated the procedural history of the case, that he was not required to file a Petition in Error, that his appeal could not be dismissed because of his failure to file a petition in error, that the requirement to do so amounted to an unconstitutionally vague requirement denying him due process of law, and that his appeal was dismissed on a technicality. The court disagreed. It held that a Petition in Error was required to confirm jurisdiction for appeal under Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1087. In addition, defendant had both the time originally allotted and three extensions of time in which to present the court with the record it needed to obtain jurisdiction and adjudicate his appeal. He failed to do so. Therefore he had defaulted on his right to have his post-conviction appeal heard by the court. His motion for reconsideration and stay of execution was denied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion was denied. The court found that defendant had the proper time allotted to him on appeal plus three extensions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that defendant killed her girlfriend because she was leaving her. The shooting happened after defendant and her girlfriend argued, where defendant then followed the victim to the police station. Among many contentions of error, defendant claimed that she was improperly denied jury instructions on a self-defense theory. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and death sentence, holding that defendant was not entitled to such an instruction under the facts shown. The court noted that even if the victim was the initial aggressor she clearly indicated a desire to withdraw. Also, when defendant followed the victim she became the pursuer, which was clear when she retrieved a gun to shoot the girlfriend. Thus, the evidence did not support the request for a self-defense instruction. The court remanded on the sentence for the firearm charge because due to an error in the jury instruction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the venue, jury selection, insufficiency of evidence of premeditation, admission of opinion evidence, jury charges, prosecutorial misconduct, competency of counsel, defendant's absence from the sentencing, and the constitutionality of the aggravating factor of a continuing threat to society. The court affirmed. Defendant failed to show prejudice from the venue or from any incompetent assistance of counsel. Defendant failed to prove a fair-cross section violation or an abuse of discretion in the jury selection. The physical evidence belied an absence of premeditation. The opinion of an investigator as to where the victim was standing when shot by defendant was admissible as testimony helpful to the trier of fact. No reversible error resulted from prosecutorial misconduct. The record showed that defendant validly waived his right to be present at sentencing. The challenged aggravator was constitutional. As to jury instructions, defendant underestimated severely the ability of the jury to determine which instructions applied to the first stage and the second stage of the proceedings.

The court reversed the determination that the statute was unconstitutional and remanded the case for further proceedings regarding sentencing.

Defendants petitioned for rehearing and argued that further prosecution was barred because the effect of the trial court's ruling was the same as that of an order sustaining a demurrer to an information. The court held that: (1) the precedent upon which defendants relied was inapplicable because it related to a judgment that had been rendered before the effective date of &sect; 1053.1, which provided for an automatic appeal of judgments holding statutes unconstitutional in criminal cases; (2) an erroneous judgment holding a statute to be unconstitutional was not tantamount to one sustaining a demurrer to an information where the defects as enumerated in Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 504 (1991) appeared on the face of the information or where there was insufficient evidence; (3) the effect of an appeal under &sect; 1053.1 did not bar further prosecution except where there had been a trial on the merits before a judge who subsequently ruled a statute unconstitutional; and (4) State v.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a petition for a rehearing of the court's decision that affirmed defendant's convictions for murder in the first degree and shooting with intent to kill. Defendant was sentenced to death for each of the three murder counts, and he was sentenced to thousands of years imprisonment for the shooting with intent to kill convictions.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that a few of defendant's allegations of error were appropriate for rehearing, and the review was limited to those issues. Defendant first argued that comments made by a district attorney, who incorrectly stated that defendant voluntarily committed himself to a hospital, denied him a fair trial and reliable sentencing hearing. The court found, however, that after reviewing for fundamental error, the comments did not deprive defendant of a fair trial because the misstatements were not so egregious so as to amount to fundamental error that would require reversal or modification. The court next found that there was no error in the trial court's decision to not declare a mistrial following an emotional outburst in the courtroom because the incident was of short duration and the trial court took appropriate measures to prevent unfair prejudice. Finally, the court found that, although a more thorough account of the mitigating evidence was necessary, the sentences of death were factually substantiated and appropriate because it was clear that the jury's improper consideration of an unconstitutional aggravator did not play a significant role in the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

Of the most important alleged errors raised by appellant was a challenge to the sufficiency of the information under which he was charged. Specifically, appellant argued that it was insufficient because it failed to state what body parts were found of the victim, and what weapon was used. The court held that appellant was properly placed on notice of the relevant criminal offense and the circumstances surrounding its commission. Therefore, the information was deemed sufficient. As to appellant's remaining contentions, the court found that they were without merit, and affirmed both the conviction and the death sentence.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.7(A) (1982) and first degree burglary in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1431 (1981). The jury set punishment on the burglary conviction at 10 years imprisonment. Following a second stage proceeding, the jury recommended defendant be put to death for the murder conviction. The trial court sentenced accordingly and defendant appealed to the court. The court affirmed defendant's judgment and sentence for first degree burglary. Defendant's conviction for first degree murder was also affirmed, but his sentence of death was vacated and the cause remanded for resentencing. The State filed a petition for rehearing. The court denied the State's petition. The court rejected the State's argument that an amendment to Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 701.10a (1991) warranted a rehearing of the case. To have applied &sect; 701.10a to defendant would have deprived him of a sentencing option and would have resulted in harsher penalty options, which would have violated the prohibition against imposing a harsher punishment in an ex post facto manner.</SPAN></P>

Defendant fled with $ 300 that he used to buy drugs. Defendant failed to establish that the use of the voter registration list to compose the jury panel or an exemption of voters age 70 or older violated the fair-cross-section requirement or that the trial court abused its discretion in excusing jurors that could not consider the death penalty. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting photographs of the murder victim taken at the crime scene, and the opinion testimony of an officer regarding a comparison of defendant's shoe print with one found at the crime scene was properly admitted. Although the &quot;heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; aggravating circumstance instruction was unconstitutionally vague, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence, finding that the jury's consideration of the aggravator was at most harmless error.

He then shot her four-year-old son twice at point blank range and stabbed him. On appeal, the court held that there was no error warranting reversal or modification. The court found there was nothing coercive in the police treatment of defendant and found no evidence that the statement was not voluntary within the meaning of the Due Process Clause. Although the State conceded that no notice was given to defendant of the evidence to be used in the second stage of the trial, the court found that the omission was both harmless and waived. The court held that defendant affirmatively, voluntarily, and knowingly waived his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, which might have barred the use of evidence obtained in a competency hearing, because defendant did not object to the testimony and the defense cross-examined the witness. The court found that the facts were sufficient for any rational trier of fact to find defendant inflicted serious physical abuse on the first victim, and that the prosecutor's improper appeal to religious bias in the jurors was harmless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's charges on two murders were tried separately. The State raised the subject murder in the sentencing phase of the first murder trial. That conviction was overturned. During the sentencing phase on the subject murder, the State raised defendant's first murder. Defendant claimed that because the murder was raised in the first murder trial, he could not have been prosecuted on the subject murder charge. The court held that the conviction was supported by sufficient, though conflicting and circumstantial, evidence and that the sentences were proper. The murder charge was not collaterally estopped or barred by double jeopardy when it was raised during the first murder trial because that was not an independent crime, it was not an adjudication, and the first murder was relevant to determine a proper sentence. Thus, the first murder was relevant to prove defendant's propensity to commit future violent crimes. However, the murder should not have been raised as proof of a prior felony because it was overturned. However, that error was harmless because it was cumulative. The jury was not overly prejudiced by the disclosure of the first murder to determine the sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a decision of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which convicted him of murder in the first degree, in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.7, and robbery with a dangerous weapon, after former conviction of two or more felonies, in violation of &sect; 801. The jury found four aggravating circumstances and recommended punishment of death. The trial court sentenced accordingly.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The decedent's body was discovered in his apartment. The decedent had been beaten, strangled, and stabbed. The court found no reversible error in jury selection. The mere fact that one juror knew the victim's daughter did not render him incapable of serving on the jury. Defense counsel's failure to remove that juror was a part of trial strategy and was not ineffective assistance. Two prospective jurors were not improperly removed from the panel because their views about capital punishment would have prevented or substantially impaired their duties as jurors in accordance with the instructions and their oath. No violation of equal protection principles arose. The court also held that the evidence was sufficient and that the prosecutor's comments did not deprive defendant of a fair trial. The verdicts rendered in accordance with Oklahoma's capital sentencing procedure were general verdicts that complied with the requirements of Okla. Const. art. 7, &sect; 15. The court held that defendant's prior felony convictions and the violent manner in which the robbery was committed supported the sentence. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury's finding of aggravating circumstances.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 843, and sentenced him to 25 years imprisonment. The court also made a crime victims compensation assessment pursuant to the Crime Victims Compensation Act, Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At sentencing, the trial court added an assessment of $ 10,000 to the Victim's Compensation Fund pursuant to the Act. Defendant challenged the assessment, among other things, contending that the sentencing procedure violated his rights to due process. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence but reversed the crime victims compensation assessment on the ground that the trial court did not consider all of the factors mandated by Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 142.18(A) (1984). The court reasoned that although ample evidence was presented at trial as to the severity of the crime and defendant's prior criminal record, no evidence was presented at trial or the sentencing hearing regarding defendant's ability to pay, or the economic impact of the assessment on defendant's dependents. The court determined that this lack of evidence constituted reversible error because it was the consideration of these four facts that satisfied the due process requirement that the assessment was not arbitrary. The court also decided that it could not presume the statutorily required elements were considered where no evidence in the record addressed them.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the conviction and sentence. The allegations of error not raised at trial or on direct appeal were not properly before the court. The statement referred to as exculpatory was an unsworn prior inconsistent statement made by a co-defendant and was not exculpatory in nature. As such, it was not subject to discovery by the inmate. The jury was instructed that the aggravating circumstance was to be directed to crimes where the death of the victim was preceded by torture or serious physical abuse of the victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and raised several issues on appeal. One of the more important was whether it was an error to admit his confession after he saw his lawyer and was told not to talk to the police. Despite his attorney's advice, defendant volunteered the information after his attorney left even after being warned by the police about what his attorney had advised. The court held that the police had only asked routine booking questions after the attorney had left, and in no way improperly interrogated defendant. Having been warned by his lawyer and the police, defendant's statements were properly admitted as voluntary. Another major issue was the trial court's failure to conduct the mandatory competency hearing once defendant's possible incompetency was raised. The court held that under the particular factual circumstances the hearing was properly conducted post-trial upon remand following an earlier appeal. The court held that defendant's competency at the time of the trial was meaningfully determined at the post-trial hearing on credible and competent evidence and that any error in failing to hold the hearing at the proper time was cured.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 40, &sect; 165.8 (Supp. 1982). The court placed the case upon its accelerated docket.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged under &sect; 165.8 with failing to pay accrued wages as required by Okla. Stat. tit. 40, &sect; 165.2 (Supp. 1982). The special trial judge sustained his demurrer on a finding that Okla. Stat. tit. 40, &sect; 165.8 (Supp. 1982) was unconstitutional because it made it a criminal offense for committing a civil wrong. On appeal, the State argued that &sect; 165.8 was not unconstitutional. In affirming, the court found that violations of Okla. Stat. tit. 40, &sect; 165.2 (Supp. 1982) were designated as misdemeanors pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 40, &sect; 165.8 (Supp. 1982) and were punishable by fine and imprisonment pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 10 (1981). The court held that such treatment of the failure to pay wages was contrary to Okla. Const. art.

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.12, including that the murders were heinous, atrocious or cruel, &sect; 701.12(4).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant did not deny the acts of which he was accused, but raised the defense of insanity pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 152(4) (1981). Prior to trial, defendant was examined to determine his competence to stand trial pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1175.1 (1981). He offered records of his competency evaluation to support his insanity defense at trial but the trial court ruled that the records were irrelevant. On appeal, the court affirmed the ruling and held that the question of an accused's competency to stand trial was an entirely different matter than the defense of insanity and that any probative value of the competency evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger of misleading the jury and confusing the issues of competency and insanity. With regard, to sentencing, the court struck the aggravating circumstance of heinous, atrocious or cruel because the trial court failed to instruct the jury that the circumstance applied only to those murders in which torture or serious physical abuse preceded the victim's death. The death sentence was affirmed, however, because the jury found two other aggravating circumstances in each murder.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's convictions for murder in the first degree and shooting with intent to kill. The court also affirmed the death sentences.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed and affirmed defendant's conviction. The court held that the evidence presented was insufficient to support an instruction on first degree manslaughter or second degree murder, because to have been entitled to such instructions, the evidence had to show that the homicide was perpetrated without a design to effect death by means of a dangerous weapon. The court found that the evidence showed that after defendant shot the officer the first time, he placed the barrel against the officer's chest and fired the weapon a second time and that it was impossible for rational juror to have found that such death was not the result of a premeditated design. As to an alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, the court found that the record was devoid of any evidence to have indicated that defendant's counsel should have been successful on the motion to suppress and that other tactical decisions of the attorney were not inadequate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his convictions of felony murder and robbery with a firearm in the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma), which, as recommended by the jury, sentenced defendant to death by lethal injection for the murder count and 200 years imprisonment for the robbery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A jury convicted defendant of both robbery and felony murder where the robbery served as the predicate felony for the shooting death of a restaurant employee, who had attempted to thwart the robbery. The jury found the existence of two aggravating circumstances under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.12(1) and (7) (1981) and recommended the death penalty. On appeal, the court rejected defendant's charges of prosecutorial misconduct, erroneous jury instructions, and improper eyewitness in-court identification. The court also held that the specific statutory procedure designed for capital cases found in Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.13(E)(2) (Supp. 1985) took precedence over the general statutes of criminal procedure found in Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 936 (1981). Although the court did affirm defendant's conviction for felony murder and the sentence of death imposed under its independent review of capital cases, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect;701.13(C) (Supp. 1985), the court reversed the robbery conviction and sentence. Because the robbery conviction had merged into the felony murder offense, convictions for both offenses violated defendant's right to not twice be put in jeopardy for the same offense.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's judgment and sentence for first degree robbery and remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss, but affirmed defendant's conviction for felony murder and his sentence to death.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant operated a vehicle salvage yard. Law officers and a staff member from the Oklahoma Used Motor Vehicle &amp; Parts Commission visited defendant's business and conducted a warrantless administrative investigation. Days later police and deputies arrived at the premises with a search warrant, which was obtained based on information gathered during the first search. They found stolen vehicles and automobile parts. Two days later a warrantless search was conducted on some land about two miles away from the salvage yard. The police found stolen vehicles, which were eventually seized. Defendant was arrested, tried, and convicted. He appealed. The court rejected defendant's argument that the initial search was an illegal warrantless search disguised as an administrative investigation. The court rejected his contention that the statute authorizing such investigations was unconstitutional. The court found that the subject search met the three or four criteria used to determine the constitutionality of such searches. Since the first search met constitutional muster defendant's argument that the others were tainted by it was meritless. The search on open land did not require a warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice forced their victim into his car, drove around, held him at gunpoint, and later shot him. The court held that admitting testimony that defendant gave in the trial of his accomplice was proper. The testimony was not admitted under judicial notice. The evidence was enough to satisfy the requirement that a factual basis for the crime was established. The element of intent was proven through defendant's own statements. Thus, there was no merit to his argument that the record did not establish a factual basis for his plea. Defendant did not make any allegations which would indicate that there was any doubt as to his competency. The trial court did not err in refusing to allow him to withdraw his plea. He never alleged that his plea was involuntary. The decision to allow the withdrawal of a plea was within the sound discretion of the trial court. There was sufficient evidence of torture in the context of the heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravating circumstances. Based on a thorough reviewing the entire record, the sentence of death was supported by the evidence and it was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was convicted of murder.

Those issues were not raised on direct appeal. The court affirmed the judgment, finding that while the improper instruction caused the aggravating circumstance of especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel to fail it did not necessitate an automatic modification of the death sentence. Further the jury found that two other aggravating circumstances existed. The court concluded that reweighing evidence did not violate petitioner's right to have a jury set his sentence because he waived that right under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect;&sect; 701.10(A), (B) (1981). The court found after performing the harmless error analysis to the second stage sentencing errors that the jury was not property instructed, the aggravating circumstance was invalid, but other aggravating circumstances and the mitigating evidence revealed sufficient evidence to support the imposition of the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

Post-conviction relief was denied, and the petitioner appealed. The court affirmed, holding that although the jury was not properly instructed as to the aggravating circumstance that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, the other aggravating circumstances were valid and revealed that sufficient evidence existed to support the imposition of the death penalty. The court had the authority to review the remaining aggravating circumstances to determine the validity of the death sentence, pursuant to Okla.

The trial court acted within its discretion under Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner beat his sister and her husband to death. The jury found two aggravating circumstances: (1) that the murders were especially heinous, atrocious, and cruel, and (2) that petitioner created great risk of death to more than one person. On appeal, the court held that the finding of the first aggravating circumstance was invalid because a jury instruction failed to sufficiently channel the sentencer's discretion as required by the U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The court found that the remaining aggravating circumstance was that petitioner created great risk of death to more than one person, but during the sentencing stage of trial the prosecutor hardly mentioned the factor at all, focusing instead on heinous, atrocious, or cruel. Thus, the court concluded that it could not determine with certainty that the jury would have recommended the death penalty had it not considered the invalidated aggravator that the murders were heinous, atrocious, or cruel. As to the anti-sympathy instruction, the court held that the instructions properly informed the jury that it was to consider all mitigating evidence and it was not to allow arbitrary sympathy to enter into its sentencing decision.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State, under a reserved question of law under Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1053.1 (Supp. 1981), appealed the judgment of a special judge in the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma), who sustained defendant's demur to an information that charged him with assault and battery on a police officer under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 649 (Supp. 1989). The special judge held that &sect; 649 was unconstitutionally vague and overprotective of a class of citizens.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with assault and battery on a police officer. The court reversed the special judge's order that sustained defendant's demur to the information. The court accepted the State's appeal although the filing was past the 10-day requirement of Okla. Ct. Crim. App. R. 2.5, 2.1(B), Okla. Stat. tit. 22, ch. 18, app. (Supp. 1989). An automatic appeal was mandated, and the State's reliance on an erroneous date in its intent to appeal notice that caused the delay was excusable neglect. The special judge erred in determining that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 649 (Supp. 1989) was unconstitutionally vague because he misread the statute's language. Section 649(A) related to a misdemeanor offense of assault, and &sect; 649(B) defined the felony offense as battery, or assault and battery. Section 649 was also not violative of equal protection although it protected police officers. Section 649 bore a rational relationship to a legitimate state interest. The legislature, in providing greater punishment for assault, assault and battery, or battery of a police officer versus other citizens, attempted to provide additional protection to police officers during the performance of their duties.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was assessed punishment at eight years imprisonment. Defendant had been tried for three counts of lewd molestation. Defendant was acquitted of the other two counts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was accused of molesting a three and a half-year-old girl. At trial, several people testified that defendant had molested the alleged victim. However, the testimony at trial was largely confusing and contradictory. The child's mother testified that the child had indicated that someone other than defendant had molested her. Pursuant to Okla. Code Crim. P., Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 753 (1984), the deposition of the child was video taped. The video taped deposition was admitted at trial and shown to the jury. Defendant argued that the showing of the video tape violated his right to be confronted with the witnesses against him as was guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. VI and Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 20. On appeal, the court reversed, holding that: (1) Okla. Code Crim. P., Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 753 (1984) was constitutional on its face; (2) where there was no hearing to determine whether the video taped testimony was necessary to protect the child, Okla. Code Crim. P., Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 753 (1984) was unconstitutionally applied in this case; and (3) defendant was deprived of his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrested for an undercover sale of 1/8th ounce of methamphetamine and possession of 168.8 grams of methamphetamine in his house, which was located within 1000 feet a school. He pleaded guilty to unlawful distribution of methamphetamine within 1000 feet of a school under Okla. Stat. &sect; 2-401A and unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute under Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-401A. The court held that Section 2-401 was a lesser-included offense of Section 2-401A. The court also found Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-401A(D), which mandated that the sections did not merge, did not pass constitutional muster. Where a single act constituted a violation of both Section 2-401 and Section 2-401A, an application of Section 2-401A(D) would have violated the state and federal double jeopardy clauses. The court determined that all of Section 2-401A was unconstitutional because it had no severance clause. The court found, however, the holding left no gap in the statutes because the same criminal conduct was proscribed by Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-401 (Supp. 1989), which required less proof than Section 2-401A and provided a greater potential for punishment.</SPAN></P>

The district court held that resolution of this issue was barred by the doctrine of res judicata because petitioner could have raised it on direct appeal or in his first application for post conviction relief. On appeal, the court addressed the merits of his contention because a United States Supreme Court decision constituted an intervening change in the law. The court agreed that the aggravating circumstance failed because the jury based its finding of such circumstance upon an unconstitutionally vague instruction. However, it reweighed the remaining aggravating circumstances against the mitigating evidence and affirmed. The reweighing process did not deny petitioner his right to sentencing by a jury because under state law, the court was allowed to reweigh as part of the authorized sentence review. Its authority to reweigh was not limited to review on direct appeal. The court's exercise of its statutory review powers did not constitute an ex post facto violation.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that a certified copy of a forensic report was sufficiently reliable to have been admissible without supporting testimony offered as proof by the State that a crime in fact had been committed. The court found that the preliminary examination was not a trial. The standard of proof at a preliminary hearing was decidedly lower than the &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; standard which must have been met at trial. In light of that differing burden of proof, the legislature, by enacting Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 751 (1981), decided that for the preliminary examination only, an additional exception to the rule against hearsay evidence was warranted.

The jury returned a verdict of guilty and recommended punishment at death after determining the aggravating circumstances that defendant was previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence, and that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel. Defendant was sentenced accordingly and he appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant alleged, inter alia, that the trial court error in admitting evidence of his previous acts of violence in violation of the hearsay rule. In light of defendant's failure to object to the notice requirements at the time and manner prescribed by the law, he had waived his right to claim error based on those grounds. Thus, the decedent's fear of defendant was relevant. Defendant alleged that the trial court erred in failing to instruct on either first-degree manslaughter or second-degree murder. Considering the nature of the wounds and the surrounding circumstances, a rational juror could not find from the evidence that the victim's death was not the result of a premeditated design to effect death. Clearly there was no evidence that the death arose from heat of passion. Therefore, defendant was not entitled to such instructions. There was no evidence that the verdict would have been different had the jury heard that the victim had a prior conviction; such evidence was properly excluded as inadmissible. While certain prosecutorial remarks were unnecessary and were not to be condoned, they were not so improper as to have affected the verdict of the jury.</SPAN></P>

The court again affirmed the district court's order that denied the application for post-conviction relief. The court held that petitioner failed to establish ineffective assistance of appellate counsel with respect to the first application for post-conviction relief, which was necessary for the court to have considered the bulk of his application. Petitioner's representation by his appellate counsel did not fall below the level of reasonably effective assistance guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, and Okla. Stat. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence showed that before killing a store clerk, defendant showed his friend the gun he had and said that he wanted to see what it felt like to kill somebody.

He conceived an elaborate plan to &quot;discover&quot; his parents dead in bed. Affirming, the court held that the repeated incidences of violence and the callused manner of defendant's actions supported a finding of aggravating circumstance in all three homicides. Even though the court found that the murders were not especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.12(4), and the jury's finding of this aggravating circumstance had to fail, the court found that the evidence did support the jury's finding of the aggravating circumstance that defendant would constitute a continuing threat to society and that he knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person when he killed his parents. The weight of these aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances defendant presented.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two women invested in companies based on defendant's advice. Neither he nor the securities were registered with the State. Neither woman had experience in investment, and both lost the entire amount they risked. He was tried and convicted, and the trial court ordered that the sentences on each count were to be served consecutively. On appeal, the court affirmed. Defendant waived claims of all but fundamental error when he failed to object to any jury instructions during trial. The trial court instructed the jury on the only exemption defense supported by the evidence. It heard evidence of the alleged conspiracy in camera and determined that there was a conspiracy. The fact that the prosecutor put on hearsay conspiracy evidence in the trial before proof of the conspiracy was not error under the circumstances. The Oklahoma Securities Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 71, &sect; 1 et seq. (1981), was neither vague nor overbroad. Objections to the prosecutor's actions were not preserved for appeal, and the court would not consider an argument other than the one made at trial. The consecutive sentences were not injected with passion and prejudice and did not shock the conscience of the court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a decision of the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma), which found defendant guilty of the primary charge and not guilty of former conviction in an action for possession of a controlled dangerous substance with intent to distribute after former conviction of a felony. Defendant was sentenced in accord with the jury's verdict to 25 years imprisonment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A confidential information bought phencyclidine (PCP) at an apartment and reported the buy to the police. Several police officers arrived at the apartment to serve a search warrant. One officer went around the back while others served the warrant at the front door. At about the same moment the police announced their presence, the officer saw defendant throw a bag out of a window. The officer retrieved the bag and discovered that it contained four vials containing PCP. Another bag was also seized. In affirming the judgment, vacating the sentencing, and remanding the matter for resentencing, the court found that he jury was instructed incorrectly regarding the possible length of sentence. The trial court had to consider resentencing pursuant to Okla. Ct. Crim. App. R., Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect;&sect; 929, 1066 (Supp. 1990). The court found that testimony that defendant also possessed marijuana did not contribute to the jury's determination of guilt. Admonition by the trial court was sufficient to cure this evidentiary error. As to defendant's claims of prosecutorial misconduct, none of the challenged comments were so grossly improper as to require reversal.</SPAN></P>

Her motion to be certified as a juvenile was denied and defendant was convicted of the charged crimes. After the denial of juvenile certification was denied, defendant appealed her convictions. The court affirmed the murder and robbery convictions. The court reversed the burglary conviction. Because the jury was given alternative murder theories and failed to specify which theory was relied upon in convicting defendant of murder, the court concluded that defendant was convicted under the felony-murder theory and reversed the burglary conviction. The trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder, as no rational trier of fact could have found that the death was the result of anything but a premeditated design to effect death. The admission of photographs of the victim's body was not an abuse of discretion. Because murder was one of the offense enumerated in Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1104.2 (Supp. 1985), police officers were not required to comply with Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1109 (1985) when questioning a juvenile.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the doctrine of res judicata barred consideration in post-conviction proceedings of issues which had been, or which could have been, raised on direct appeal. The court rejected petitioner's contention that he was entitled to a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence in the form of a man's statement that petitioner was not the only person involved in the murder. The court determined that the trial court's denial of the motion for a new trial was not an abuse of discretion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the court denied a prisoner's first motion for post-conviction relief from his murder conviction and death sentence, the prisoner petitioned for habeas corpus relief in federal court. The case was remanded. He filed a second motion for post-conviction relief alleging that the jury instructions on aggravating circumstances were improper. He appealed after the District Court, Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, denied his second motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner argued that the jury was improperly instructed regarding the aggravating circumstance &quot;that the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; (HAC). The court recognized that its review of the prisoner's first post-conviction relief motion was improperly based on a broader application of HAC. HAC was properly directed to those crimes where the death of the victim was preceded by torture of the victim or serious physical abuse. This required the sentencer to conduct a two-step analysis. The record showed that the prisoner and a friend went hunting for a person to kill and found such a victim. Defendant hit the victim in the head with a hammer. The victim attempted to sit up. Defendant hit him again repeatedly, then stomped and kicked him until he died. The evidence supported a finding that the victim suffered great physical pain before his death. Thus, the death penalty was appropriately considered. The facts also supported an HAC finding on two independent grounds. The murder was shockingly pitiless, and the victim suffered before his death. The jury was not improperly instructed in regards to the &quot;anti-sympathy&quot; instruction. There was no reversible error.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was arrest for running a stop sign and demanded a jury trial. The special judge denied her request on the ground that the only punishment associated with her offense was a fine and costs. During the trial, defendant did not cross examine the State's witness or present any evidence on her behalf. Defendant was convicted and assessed a fine and costs. She challenged the judgment. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for a jury trial. The court held that defendant was entitled to a jury trial under Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 19 and Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 601 (1981). Further, the court held that the trial court unduly deprived defendant of her constitutional and statutory right to a trial by jury. The court reasoned that for the offense charged, defendant was entitled to a jury because the range of punishment as provided for in Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 17-101(b) (1981) exceeded a possible fine of $ 20 and provided the possibility for jail time. The pretrial decision of the trial judge constituted a waiver of the defendant's right to a jury without her consent and therefore constituted a deprivation of a fundamental and constitutional right of defendant.</SPAN></P>

Affirming the conviction, the court found sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. The court found no abuse of discretion after the trial court allowed the State to use the preliminary hearing testimony of a hospitalized witness. The evidence did not support a heat of passion manslaughter instruction. Circumstantial evidence was strong enough for the jury to find that defendant committed a subsequent burglary of the victim's house, and that the evidence made more probable that defendant intended to kill the victim's wife, supporting the aggravating circumstance of continuing threat. The trial court's instructions on evidence of mitigating circumstances were sufficient. The evidence presented to the jury amply supported the finding that defendant was competent to stand trial.</SPAN></P>

The victim had been repeatedly harassing the step-daughter and had frequently become violent.

Defendant told the step-daughter that he had shot the victim and buried the body and police officers taped statements made to third parties regarding his role in the crime. Defendant was arrested and convicted, but the body was never found. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the circumstantial evidence that defendant committed the crime was sufficient to convict defendant. The court further found that the trial judge was properly permitted to ask questions of a witness where he did not communicate his view to the jury. The court additionally held that there was no delay in arraignment where defense counsel was the reason for the delay. The court concluded that the recording of defendant's conversations to a third party were properly admissible because defendant had no expectation of privacy in communications to other people who might betray his trust.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was found guilty of first degree murder and rape. Prior to trial, defense counsel requested that the trial court appoint several experts to aid him in presenting his defense. He sought a psychiatrist to evaluate the possibility that appellant did not know right from wrong and to show mental or emotional disturbance as a mitigating circumstance. The district judge granted appellant's request for these experts, but later determined that he did not have a duty to appoint the requested experts and denied the motion. Since the time of this hearing, the United States Supreme Court has declared otherwise. Defense counsel did not articulate with specificity why he suspected that appellant's sanity was likely to be a significant factor in his defense. However, he did raise enough doubt about appellant's mental state to warrant an evidentiary hearing. Therefore, the court granted the request for an evidentiary hearing to afford appellant the opportunity to present what he could have shown the district court with regard to whether the forensic odontologist and the chemist were required as &quot;basic tools&quot; of his defense.</SPAN></P>

The instructions required the State to prove that defendant had reasonable cause to believe the property in his possession was stolen, which was proper because there was no requirement that the State prove actual knowledge. The instructions, when read together, advised the jury of the presumption of innocence and required the jury to consider, along with other elements of the crime, whether defendant should have believed that the goods were stolen. The defendant was not entitled to an instruction on his proposed defense that he did not know the goods were stolen because such a position was not actually a defense, because the State had to prove that element of the offense. The court concluded that while defendant was entitled to a jury instruction on his proposed defense provided it was defense and there was evidence in support of it, but the court found no defense supported by the required evidence.</SPAN></P>

Ed Callaway, appellant, was convicted in the District Court of Oklahoma County, for violation of Chapter 4.32.010 of the Edmond Municipal Code, (IV Counts), which prohibits the admission of persons under eighteen years of age to enter any pool hall, snooker parlor, billiard parlor, or similar place of business. He was fined $ 70.00 for each count, with all fines and costs suspended. REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions to DISMISS.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged an order of the District Court of Oklahoma County (Oklahoma), which convicted him of violating Edmond, Okla., Municipal Code ch. 4.32.010, which prohibited the admission of persons under 18 years of age to any pool hall, snooker parlor, billiard parlor, or similar place of business. Defendant was fined $ 70.00 for each count, with all fines and costs suspended.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the municipality's ordinance violated the right of persons under the age of 18 to freedom of association. In disagreeing, the court found that persons under the age of 18 did not have a generalized right of &quot;social association&quot; at defendant's place of business. Persons under 18 were not involved in an activity at defendant's business that qualified as a form of intimate association or expressive association protected by the federal constitution. The court found that the purpose of the ordinance was to prohibit gambling, which was a proper public purpose. However, the ordinance was not rationally related to that objective. Singling out pool halls from other amusement establishments was an act of discrimination, not policy. Indeed, the record did not indicate that gambling was ever observed at defendant's business. In the court's view, the mere presence of persons under age 18 could not be equated with illegal conduct. Thus, the ordinance was too broad and could not be justified under Okla. Const. art. 2, &sect; 7 because it did not bear some rational relationship to a legitimate state purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the matter with instructions for the trial court to dismiss the charges against defendant.</SPAN></P>

The prisoner argued that the law in effect when he entered his plea became a basis for his plea agreement and that the application of the 1989 amendment was an improper imposition of an ex post facto law. The court held that two conditions must be satisfied for a law to be ex post facto: it must be retrospective and it must disadvantage the offender. The court held that because &sect; 574 was triggered exclusively by the size of the prison population, it could be imposed only on the basis of events which occurred after it was enacted.

Neither defendant nor the State found fault with that determination. Defendant had no prior convictions or charges on his record, although he was arrested on one occasion. Defendant's psychological evaluation showed that he had an IQ of 72, and that he admitted to experimentation with alcohol and the weekly use of marijuana. The doctor stated that the jail time had opened a window of &quot;amenability to traditional interventions,&quot; and that defendant had a good prognosis if placed in a secure residential facility followed by placement in a post institutional group home. The trial court declined to certify defendant as a child because the Oklahoma Department of Human Services had a greater demand than they had facilities. The Department would not guarantee that defendant would receive the treatment in the juvenile system. The court held that amendments to Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1104.2 (Supp. 1989) had not rendered the statute unconstitutional.

On appeal, the court held that the DSPYA plan was in lieu of the presentence investigation required by Okla.

Defendant was convicted of three counts of murder in the first degree while committing a robbery with a dangerous weapon and sentenced to death on each count. On appeal, the court held that defendant's conviction was proper because (1) he was not denied a jury representing a fair cross-section of the community; (2) he did not demonstrate antagonistic defenses nor prejudice resulting from being tried with his codefendant; and (3) his incriminating statement to two officers after his arrest and request for counsel was voluntary, given that the officers advised defendant that they were not there to discuss his case, and their giving their business cards in case he or his attorney wished to contact the police did not amount to an interrogation. The court ruled that the sentences of death were proper because they were not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and the evidence supported the jury's findings of the four aggravating circumstances charged.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was sentenced to death. On appeal before the United States Supreme Court, the court found that defendant's death sentence was invalid because of the aggravating circumstances relied upon in that case as support for the imposition of the death penalty were unconstitutionally vague. On remand, the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the jury's verdict, and held that the jury's finding that the murder was &quot;especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; did not violate the previous dictates in Furman v. Georgia, requiring that the discretion of the sentencer be limited by some comprehensible standards. The jury was sufficiently advised of the limits to the amount of discretion which was available for exercise in the determination of whether the crime committed was &quot;especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel&quot; and concomitantly, whether the death penalty was the appropriate punishment.

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.13(E)(2) (1985), which the court held authorized remand of a capital case for resentencing. The court ruled that Okla.

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.13(E)(2) (Supp. 1985) on remand, and to the extent Dutton v. Dixon, 757 P.2d 376 (Okla. Crim. 1988), was inconsistent, it was expressly overruled. The court ruled that the ex post facto clause had not prevented the State from depriving a criminal defendant of an expectation as to a procedure that had not yet accrued to his benefit. Therefore, petitioner could have been resentenced under Okla.

Petitioner, the City of Tulsa, has appealed to this Court on a reserved question of law.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ordinance required operators and front seat passengers of passenger cars to wear a seatbelt. The motorist had challenged the ordinance on equal protection grounds, as the ordinance exempted pickup trucks, recreational vehicles, and vans. The court noted at the outset that the Oklahoma legislature had amended the vehicle classification statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 12-417 (Supp. 1987) to remove pickup trucks and vans from the list of vehicles to which the seat belt requirement did not apply. Therefore, the remaining legislative distinction being challenged was that between passenger cars and recreational vehicles. The court held that because the distinctions in neither the ordinance nor statute were inherently invidious or impinged upon fundamental rights, the rational basis test applied to determine their constitutionality. The court concluded that the legislative distinction between passenger cars and recreational vehicles was valid under the rational basis standard. The promotion of public safety was a legitimate governmental goal, and the court could reasonably conceive of facts that would justify treating passenger cars and recreational vehicles differently.</SPAN></P>

Finding no error, the court affirmed the judgment and sentence. The declaration of a mistrial was not warranted by the detective's testimony that the victim identified defendant at the police station on the night of the crime. Because defendant did not object, the court reviewed for fundamental error only. The testimony was merely cumulative because the victim testified to the extrajudicial identification before the detective testified. Having found the admission of the detective's testimony to be harmless error, the court found that defense counsel's failure to object to it did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. An extensive proportionality analysis was not required to determine whether defendant's sentence was excessive, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, because the sentence did not foreclose the possibility of parole. The sentence did not shock the court's conscience because there was no maximum sentence under the recidivist statute, the attempted kidnapping was violent, and defendant's prior felonies involved violence.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.7(C) (Supp. 1982) was unconstitutional; and (3) the trial court erred in admitting evidence of child abuse and in failing to give a limiting instruction concerning the use of such evidence. Upon review, the court found defendant's arguments without merit. Medical testimony revealed that the fatal injury most likely occurred within 12 hours of the child's arrival at the hospital. Based on the evidence, any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant inflicted the injury which caused the death of her daughter. The instruction given was not coercive. The State's evidence clearly tended to establish that the child's death was not the result of an accident. Therefore, such evidence was admissible.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the mother of an illegitimate child had the sole responsibility of caring for and maintaining the child.

He was not considered a suspect in the murder but was questioned in his mother's presence as to what he knew about the homicide. An officer testified that he spoke with the juvenile alone for five minutes and that the juvenile decided to confess. His mother returned and was present for the confession. At that time, he was not charged with first degree murder; thus, mandatory adult certification under &sect; 1104.2 did not apply. His motion to suppress the confession was overruled. The juvenile argued that his confession was inadmissible under Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1109 (1986) because it resulted from the officer's &quot;secretive questioning.&quot; However, he did not address the five-minute period in his brief, and the officer's testimony reflected that he did not question the juvenile. Thus, the court held that the suppression motion was properly overruled. The magistrate's ruling was properly limited to the prospective merit hearing only.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from orders of the District Court of Tulsa County (Oklahoma), which granted the State's applications to revoke suspended sentences imposed on defendant.

Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 60 et seq. (1987).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's wife obtained a protective order pursuant to the Act that ordered defendant not to visit with, assault, molest, or otherwise interfere with her, not to threaten her, and to remain away from her residence. After defendant pled guilty to violating the order, he received suspended sentences. When defendant made threatening phone calls to his former wife in further violation of the protective order, the State sought revocation of the suspended sentences. The trial court revoked the suspended sentences and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected defendant's argument that the Act was unconstitutionally vague, explaining that the term &quot;visit&quot; in Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 60.4(D)(2) (1987), in its ordinary sense, meant a personal confrontation initiated by the enjoined person and that the phrase &quot;otherwise interfere&quot; clearly meant interference of the same general character, kind, nature, or class as visit, assault, molest, or harass. The court further held that the term &quot;visit&quot; was not unconstitutionally overbroad because it was subject to a narrow construction which did not have a real and substantial effect on any legitimate and constitutionally protected speech.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the body of the act had a logical or natural connection to its title, and the language in the title was both clear and concise and was in no manner deceptive or confusing as to the subject matter contained therein. The court reversed the conviction, however, because the trial court allowed the prosecutor to use defendant's prior arrests to impeach her testimony during cross-examination. Defendant had testified that she had assisted the bureau of narcotics as an informant. The court found that the arrests were not related to the charges in the case. Some of them dated back thirty years and involved forged instruments. None of the arrests resulted in criminal prosecution, much less conviction.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, defendant argued the neighbor's identification testimony should not have been admitted.

Defendant argued that use of force was an element of the crime of sodomy and the state had not been required to prove it. The court found that use of force was only needed where the sex was consensual and there was no allegation by defendant that the prosecutrix had consented. The information which charged defendant with burglary was sufficient because defendant was not misled by it and the jury instruction accurately defined the elements.

Defendant watched while his companions raped the girl and, thereafter, defendant forced the girl to orally sodomize him. Subsequently, defendant was convicted of sodomy, kidnapping, and two counts of first degree rape and sentenced accordingly. In affirming, the court held that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 886 (1981), the statute criminalizing sodomy, was constitutional. Furthermore, the court found no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of defendant's second motion for change of venue. The court noted that the trial court granted defendant's first request for a change of venue. The court found that there was nothing in the record to show that defendant did not receive a fair and impartial trial, despite the trial court's unwillingness to grant a second motion for change of venue. The court rejected defendant's contention that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that defendant aided and abetted in his companions' commission of the rapes. Lastly, the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support the convictions and that no modification of the sentence was warranted based on the facts of the case.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed because defendant did not have standing to challenge the language of the statute as overbroad because she was not charged with soliciting indiscriminate sexual intercourse without hire. Rather, she was charged and convicted of soliciting by offering sexual intercourse for hire. In addition, the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of guilt because the State presented the testimony of two police officers, who stated that defendant offered sex for money. They also testified that the house and location of the offense was known to rent rooms to prostitutes for 30-minute intervals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the prosecutrix' and other's testimony, defendant was convicted of forcible sodomy and attempted first-degree rape. Defendant challenged his conviction. As to the latter charge, the prosecution contended that the overt act required to be stated in the information was sufficiently described by the words, &quot;attempted to have sexual intercourse with (the prosecutrix) by means of force.&quot; The court disagreed and reversed defendant's conviction. The words merely repeated the legal definition of rape, in essence stating that defendant committed attempted rape by attempting to commit rape. The information described no overt physical act or actual personal threat towards the commission of the crime. Therefore, the information was fatally defective in failing to describe the overt act with sufficient specificity. Even assuming that a liberal construction might have saved the &quot;overt act&quot; deficiency, there was no mention of the requisite &quot;intent&quot; to commit rape. As for defendant's challenge to the forcible sodomy count, the court found that although the language and syntax were clumsy, the meaning was sufficiently clear to appraise defendant of what he was to defend against at trial.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the funds and advised defendant's counsel that he would have to pay for such services and then seek reimbursement for the expenses incurred in the representation of his indigent client from the Oklahoma Supreme Court. The court held that defendant's argument was without merit because the effective assistance guarantee of the due process clause required a reversal from a denial of such assistance only if defendant established prejudice by clear and convincing evidence. The court held that defendant failed to demonstrate substantial prejudice from the lack of the expert and investigative assistance. Regarding his trial, defendant argued that the trial court was without jurisdiction to instruct the jury on first degree felony-murder where the information charged first degree malice aforethought murder. The court held that where an information charged first degree malice aforethought murder, a conviction was proper for felony-murder if supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>

The transcript failed to disclose any support for defendant's claimed misunderstanding of the discretionary aspect of withdrawing a guilty plea. However, defendant was denied due process by the imposition of the death sentence because that sentence was based in part on evidence of a prior murder charge that had been dismissed after defendant's right to a speedy trial had been violated.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pleaded guilty to the crime of first-degree murder and first-degree burglary. The trial judgment conducted a hearing to receive evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors, at the end of which he imposed ten years' imprisonment for the burglary, and the death penalty on the murder conviction. The court found no indication in the record that the presence of television cameras in the courtroom disrupted the proceedings or adversely impacted the trial participants, or that the trial judge was pressured into giving the death penalty because of the media presence. There was a sufficient factual basis for accepting defendant's pleas of guilty. Defendant failed to overcome the presumption that the trial judge considered incompetent or irrelevant evidence. The sentence of death was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factors. Both aggravating circumstances and the existence of future dangerousness to society were sufficiently supported by the evidence.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of first degree murder and sentence to death. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the U.S. District Court's denial of habeas corpus relief but vacated defendant's death sentence after holding that the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant's mother to testify. It directed the district court to issue a writ of habeas corpus, modifying defendant's sentence to life imprisonment unless the State commenced new sentencing proceedings. Defendant then filed an application for a writ of prohibition to prevent the district court judge from conducting a capital resentencing trial under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.13(E)(2) (1985). The court granted the writ, finding that under the previous version of the death sentence review statute,&nbsp;&sect; 701.13(E)(2) (1981), where errors occurred during the sentencing stage of a capital trial, the court had modified the death sentence to life imprisonment. The court held that the 1985 version of the statute could not be applied retroactively without violating the ex post facto clause of U.S. Const. art. 1, &sect; 10 because it would deprive defendant of the right to have his death sentence modified to life imprisonment.</SPAN></P>

He was convicted of rape, burglary, and forcible sodomy for fellatio and cunnilingus, assault and battery, and feloniously pointing a weapon. Defendant was sentenced to serve consecutive terms of imprisonment for each offense. Defendant appealed. The court reverse his sodomy conviction for cunnilingus and otherwise affirmed. A self-serving out-of-court statement made by defendant to an arresting officer was properly excluded from trial because it constituted hearsay. Although admissible after defendant opened the issue, character evidence was excluded from trial, and the state's attempt to introduce evidence of mendacity was proper. The victim's in-court identification was inherently reliable. Because the State failed to prove the essential element of penetration, the court held that it had no alternative but to reverse the conviction for oral sodomy or cunnilingus and to remand with instructions to dismiss. The evidence otherwise supported the jury's verdict, and the punishment was within the statutory range.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a 17-year-old juvenile, challenged an order of the Creek County District Court (Oklahoma), which denied his motion to be certified as a juvenile and bound him over for trial. The state charged defendant as an adult under the Reverse Certification Statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1104.2 (Supp. 1986) with, inter alia, two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of kidnapping. The court had stayed the trial pending the appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that &sect; 1104.2 violated the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment because of the potential for execution of a person less than 18 years of age. The court noted that it had reaffirmed its prior holding that imposition of the death penalty on a juvenile who was 15 years old at the time of the offense constituted neither cruel nor unusual punishment where the minor had been certified as an adult. However, the court declined to address whether the same result would obtain under the reverse certification statute because this issue had been prematurely raised. Eighth Amendment scrutiny was appropriate only after the state had secured a formal adjudication of guilt, so as to acquire the power to punish; defendant had not been tried, convicted, or sentenced. The court rejected defendant's argument that &sect; 1104.2 violated both substantive due process and equal protection standards of review. Statutes were presumptively constitutional, and the challenging party had the burden of proving otherwise. The court affirmed and concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated its prior stay of the proceedings and affirmed the order of the district court.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction over him because jurisdiction was relinquished by the order of his release from incarceration. The court denied the writ, holding that the district court erred by releasing petitioner without a determination that he was not presently mentally ill and dangerous to the public as required by Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1161(1981). The district court acted within its jurisdiction by vacating its previous order of release and correcting the irregularity under Okla.

There was no error in the admission of witnesses' testimony regarding events that took place one week after the murder, as the statements about defendant's intentions to &quot;waste a queer&quot; constituted subsequent inculpatory statements and the admission was not an abuse of discretion. The trial court did not err when it refused to allow individual voir dire. Because defendant did not exhaust his peremptory challenges, he could not allege the bias of a juror on appeal. There was no abuse of discretion in admitting photographic evidence. Even if it was error to admit evidence of defendant's prior crimes, the admission was harmless, as the State's case against defendant was overwhelming.

The court rejected double jeopardy arguments and found several errors to be harmless, not properly preserved for review, or lacking prejudicial effect. The court found that the probative value of pictures of the body outweighed their prejudicial effect, and that it was not ineffective for defense counsel not to object to admissible evidence or acceptable prosecution remarks.

The court concluded that the employees were not exempted by &sect; 1040.53 because an adult bookstore that provided individual booths for viewing token-operated videotapes did not fit within the definition of a commercial motion picture theater set out in &sect; 1040.53. The employees also claimed that their actions did not amount to an &quot;exhibition within the meaning of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1021 (Supp. 1986). The court held that because the employees were responsible for keeping the store open for business, and because obscene videotape jackets were openly on display, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to determine that they were principals in the exhibition of the videotapes.</SPAN></P>

The occupant then took the patrolman to defendant's house. The occupant knocked on the door, called out to defendant, asking him if he was still there and if he was okay. Defendant responded by saying &quot;yes,&quot; at which point the occupant and the patrolman entered the house. After talking with defendant, the patrolman arrested defendant for driving under the influence. Defendant argued that his warrantless arrest was unconstitutional. The court held that the warrantless intrusion into defendant's home was per se unreasonable and that no exigent circumstances justified the entrance and subsequent arrest. Therefore, the court reversed defendant's conviction for driving under the influence. The court affirmed defendant's other conviction, however, because defendant failed to cite relevant authority to support his proposition of error.</SPAN></P>

This conclusion was based upon the erroneous assumption regarding petitioner's prior record. However, the court noted that the trial court had determined that the sentence was proper in light of the seriousness of the crime, regardless of the prior conviction.

Cynthia Lea Crouch, appellant, was convicted in the District Court of Latimer County, Case No. CRF-84-33, of Embezzlement and False Accounts by Officers for which she received a sentence of two and one-half years' imprisonment, a fine of five hundred dollars ($ 500.00), and was required to pay restitution in the amount of forty-five thousand dollars ($ 45,000.00) within four years, and she appeals.  </SPAN></P>

Defendant claimed that the trial judge displayed bias against her and the restitution order was not supported by sufficient proof and was arbitrary and unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was the secretary/treasurer of the water department, deposited cash received by the water department to bank accounts that she and her husband maintained. On appeal from a conviction for embezzlement, defendant claimed that the trial court failed to hold an adequate hearing to determine the impact of threatening telephone calls that were made to at least two jurors during the trial. The court held that this assignment of error had no merit because defendant's counsel did not ask for a hearing or object to the instruction the trial court gave on the subject. Defendant also failed to properly preserve an assignment of error based on the trial judge's alleged display of prejudice toward defendant. Finally, the court rejected defendant's claim that the sentence and restitution she was ordered to pay was excessive and irrational. The sentence was within the range provided by the applicable statute and did not shock the court's conscience. The restitution order was not an abuse of discretion because it was related to the amount that defendant embezzled and there was no evidence that the restitution would impose manifest hardship on defendant or her family.</SPAN></P>

The court noted that the Tenth Circuit had recently held that the court's construction of the aggravating circumstance of a murder being heinous, atrocious, or cruel was unconstitutionally vague.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant asserted that the aggravating circumstance relating to murder which was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel was applied to him in an overbroad and unconstitutional way, violating the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Though the jury was instructed that the aggravating circumstance was limited to deaths preceded by torture or serious physical abuse, the aggravating circumstance had been applied in other cases without requiring such factors; the court thus held that those factors had to be present to apply the aggravating circumstance. The court observed that the evidence against defendant did not support such a finding: the victim was asleep when defendant shot her twice in the head, and there was no reason to believe that she was conscious after the first shot, having expired within minutes. The court concluded that overwhelming evidence of guilt, including two other aggravating circumstances, and rejection of self-defense or accident, made the finding that the murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel harmless error. When the court reweighed the circumstances, the court found that the death sentence was appropriate. Statutes dealing with competency did not apply.</SPAN></P>

II, &sect;&sect; 2, 7, 29 and U.S. Const. amend. V, VI, XIV. The court found that the Oklahoma court was ordering the juvenile to be returned to Texas without providing a sufficient hearing. The court noted that whatever the Compact was called, it was in the nature of an extradition proceeding, but no hearing had been held to raise the proper issues. The court agreed that a juvenile was not entitled to all the ramifications and procedures provided in an ordinary criminal trial, but he was entitled to receive sufficient due process to assure fair treatment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While working outside, a store clerk observed defendant four feet away from her masturbating. Thereafter, defendant was convicted of indecent exposure as a prior offender and was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, with 6 years suspended. On appeal, he claimed that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel for counsel's failure to cross-examine the state's witness. The court noted that this decision was a valid trial strategy in light of defendant's alibi defense. Second, defendant claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. The court noted that the eyewitness clearly viewed defendant in a well-lit area and made positive in-court identification. Because the jury's role was to weigh credibility and to resolve conflicts in testimony, the court deferred to its findings. Next, defendant claimed that the indecent exposure statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1021(1) (1981), was unconstitutional because it placed too much emphasis on the sensitivity of the victim. The court noted that a person of common intelligence would have been offended by defendant's actions and ruled that the statute was constitutional. As such, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The court held that the trial court did not err in admitting into evidence photographs of the victim before and after an autopsy.

The court held that the finding of aggravating circumstances justifying the imposition of the death penalty was supported the evidence.

The court found that the evidence showed that a homicide was clearly proven and that defendant admitted he was holding the weapon when it fired. The court ruled that defendant had the burden to sustain his motion to remand to the juvenile division, that the trial court properly considered the factors set forth in Okla.

Her counsel filed a motion in limine to prevent the State from presenting evidence of her refusal to submit to a Breathalyzer test at the time of her arrest. The trial judge held that Okla. Stat. tit. 47 &sect; 756 (1984), which allowed admission of such evidence, was unconstitutional under Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 21. On appeal, the court noted that where a blood test was physical evidence rather than testimonial, defendant's consent or lack thereof was not within the purview of Okla. Const. art. II, &sect; 21. The court also noted that the U.S. Supreme Court had held that the right to refuse such a test was a matter of legislative grace and that the test was inoffensive to the U.S. Const. amends. IV and V. As such, the court held that the state constitution was not offended by the use of evidence that a driver refused a sobriety test since the test did not implicate the constitutional protection against self-incrimination.

On review, the court held that the evidence supported the jury's finding of the aggravating circumstance that defendant knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person, pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.11 (1981). The fact that jurors knew the victims did not in itself demonstrate a need for a change of venue. A prospective juror was properly excused based on his view of the death penalty. Defendant's own testimony provided sufficient circumstantial evidence of a breaking under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1431 (1981). Because defendant's evidence of juror misconduct was insufficient to prove actual prejudice, the trial court did not err in denying the motion for a new trial. The jury was properly instructed that they should decide the weight to be given to statements defendant made while partly conscious and while in a weakened state in the hospital if they found that the statements were made freely and voluntarily, without coercion.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed, contending that the trial court erred in failing to enter a directed verdict of not guilty where the evidence failed to establish the requisite knowledge and intent and that she should have been sentenced as a first time offender under the Oklahoma Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances Act rather than as a recidivist offender under the provisions of the general habitual criminal statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 51(B) (1981). On appeal, the court held that the State introduced evidence that created a reasonable inference that defendant had knowingly placed the balloons in her bra and that the conviction was properly enhanced because defendant's prior convictions do not come within the purview of the Act.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 47, &sect; 11-902(A) (1983), was unconstitutionally vague. The court disagreed and held that the statute was constitutional. The court further found that the record was replete with testimony of defendant's legal use of controlled substances sufficient to cause a jury to speculate as to the effects of the substances. It was entirely proper for the trial court to forestall any possible speculation by the jury. Finally, the court found merit in defendant's contention that the acts of which he was convicted fell outside the scope of the Victim's Compensation Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 142.1 (1981). The Victim's Compensation Fund assessments were therefore vacated.</SPAN></P>

He denied any connection with the crime. The court rejected his numerous allegations of error and upheld his conviction and sentence to death. The court found no error in the exclusion of jurors who were opposed to the death penalty. Their exclusion did not violate defendant's right to a jury composed of a fair cross-section of the community. The prosecutor's use of three peremptory challenges against potential jurors who were black did not violate defendant's right to equal protection because the prosecutor was able to articulate logical, race-neutral reasons for his use of the peremptory challenges. There was no error in the admission of evidence belonging to the victim that was seized during a search of defendant's apartment because his girlfriend who leased the apartment consented to the search. The court held that the jury was not influenced by passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. The evidence of guilt and of the aggravating circumstances necessary for the imposition of the death penalty was substantial.</SPAN></P>

Defendant objected to the older stepdaughter's testimony. On appeal, the court found that the testimony was admissible because the testimony showed a common scheme to satisfy his sexual desires. Defendant sexually exploited the stepdaughters in the same progression of acts including attempts to convince the girls that what he was doing was for their benefit and that their mother approved of it. Even if the prosecutrix's testimony contained some inconsistencies, her testimony did not support a reversal of the rape conviction when competent evidence supported the conviction. The older stepdaughter was properly permitted to state that the prosecutrix told her about the events without including details. Section 886 was not unconstitutional because the State had a compelling interest in protecting the physical and mental health of minors who were forced to participate in sexual activity.

Defendant raised several assignments of error. On appeal, the court found that Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 440 (1981) was constitutional as applied to defendant, and defendant could not challenge the statute. Defendant intentionally misled the sheriff by denying that his son was in the house when he knew that the sheriff had probable cause to arrest the son. The information charging defendant stated the charge in statutory language, cited the statute, and state sufficient facts to charge a crime; thus, the information was sufficient to withstand defendant's motion to quash. The fact that his son was a minor was irrelevant to charging defendant as an accessory. Any error caused by the prosecutor's remarks that implied that defendant met with his son after the shooting were cured by the trial court's admonishment to counsel to stay within the evidence and were not so prejudicial to require reversal.</SPAN></P>

Defendant and his mother, who were staying at the victim's home, were questioned about the girl's disappearance. After the girl's body was found, defendant was arrested and taken to the police station where he made a statement to police. Defendant challenged his murder conviction and sentence, and the court affirmed. The court held that the initial questioning of defendant was not an arrest and did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Defendant's arrest was legal because probable cause was established, and his inculpatory statements were properly admitted. The charging information was not unconstitutionally vague, and the jury represented a fair and impartial cross-section of the community even though those who could not impose the death penalty were removed for cause. The trial court did not err in admitting into evidence the hearsay statements of the victim's four-year-old sister because she was unavailable as a witness due to her age and the trustworthiness of the statements was supported by corroborating evidence.</SPAN></P>

Under Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1104.2, the trial court was vested with the discretion to certify defendant as a juvenile. The court found this statute was not unconstitutional. The court disregarded the issue as to whether the judge abused his discretion in overruling the motion to certify defendant as a juvenile because counsel failed to supply the court with an adequate record to review the issue. The trial court did not err in denying defendant's request for a continuance of the trial date. Defendant's argument that the trial court improperly refused admission of extrinsic evidence proving a prior inconsistent statement by the victim was patently frivolous. Because there was no authority cited by defendant to support a claim that the admission at trial of evidence seized by the city police was erroneous, the court rejected that claim. Finally, defendant was not denied his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel because although defendant's counsel ignored various rules of evidence, the errors and conduct of counsel did not affect the outcome of the case.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in two separate cases with the crimes of attempted burglary and knowingly concealing stolen property. Defendant appeared for arraignment and indicated his wish to plead guilty to a 30-month negotiated sentence. The trial court, though expressing his doubts concerning the constitutionality of the Act, ruled the Act had application to his case, and that defendant would be sentenced accordingly. Defendant filed a petition for an extraordinary writ with the court, which was denied. Defendant subsequently entered his pleas of guilty to each offense. Despite the State's recommendation of a 30-month determinate sentence on each offense, the trial court sentenced defendant to an indeterminate sentence. The central issue presented on appeal was the constitutionality of the Act. The court determined that the classification created by the Act did not violate a fundamental right and that the Act bore a rational relation to a legitimate state interest. Despite the meritorious and otherwise constitutional purposes of the Act, the court held that the Act violated the separation of powers provision found in Okla. Const. art.

Whether defendant was provided with an opportunity to take a valid test was a question for the jury. Although the evidence of defendant's failure to cooperate was elicited by defendant's counsel during cross-examination, the court refused to permit defendant to profit from his own error in eliciting incompetent evidence. The presentence investigation statute,&nbsp;Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 982 (Supp. 1983) was not unconstitutional in ordering presentence investigations only in the case of felonies.

The statement that &quot;I want to make love to you&quot; was an oral lewd or indecent proposal to have unlawful sexual relations within the purview of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1123 (1983). The phrase was commonly understood as referring to sexual intercourse. The court also found that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The statute was identical to a prior statute except that it provided protection to minors of an older age than the prior statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In denying the petition for rehearing, the court pointed out that the cases cited by the State upheld statutes against a claim of being constitutionally vague, and that it had held that &sect; 886 was not unconstitutionally vague. The court also rejected the application of another Supreme Court case cited by the State, noting that in that case, which involved the constitutionality of applying a state sodomy statute to homosexuals, the plaintiffs had neither been arrested nor threatened with prosecution. Although the summary affirmance of the lower court's decision in that case was dispositive of the merits and had binding precedential effect, the court held that an affirmance by a court that did not explain its reasons was not an endorsement of the reasoning employed by the lower court, and the summary holding was required to be carefully limited. The court noted that the Supreme Court may have disposed of that case on the basis that the plaintiffs clearly lacked standing to bring the lawsuit.

The court rejected defendant's argument that the trial court improperly limited counsel's right to cross-examine the officer administering the breathalyzer test as to his ability to identify defendant. The court explained that where several other witnesses had made a positive identification, the trial court's limitations were neither an abuse of discretion, nor prejudicial. Finally, the court rejected defendant's claim that Okla. Stat. tit. 47, 11-902(A)(1) (1982) was unconstitutional and void for vagueness.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim asserted that defendant forced her, at knifepoint, to have sex with him and sodomized her. The victim also asserted that defendant beat her, causing severe injury to her eye. Defendant asserted that the sexual acts were consensual. Defendant stated that he hit the victim because he thought she was robbing him. Defendant was charged with rape, crimes against nature, and maiming. At trial, the victim's doctor testified that her eye was highly susceptible to injury due to previous damage. The jury acquitted defendant of rape and asked for further instruction on consent to crimes against nature. The trial judge instructed the jury that consent was not an element of crimes against nature. On appeal, the court reversed the crimes against nature conviction because the charge was unconstitutional as applied to defendant. Recent U.S. Supreme Court case law had indicated that the right to privacy prevented government regulation of sexual activity between consenting adults, even though unmarried. The trial court erred by refusing to instruct on the lesser-included offenses of assault and battery when his explanation for the injury indicated a lack of specific intent.</SPAN></P>

The night he was killed, he had made a delivery to defendant's home. While waiting for defendant's wife to return with payment for the groceries, according to the wife's testimony, defendant suddenly started accusing the victim of having &quot;something to do&quot; with his wife, pushing him and then striking him with a baseball bat. Defendant left for an hour and a half, wrapped the victim, who was still breathing, in a blanket, and left in the victim's car. The couple then fled Oklahoma in the victim's car. Defendant had in his possession a number of the victim's household items. The jury convicted defendant. The court affirmed. Introduction of a bat similar to the bat used was not prejudicial. The State was careful to inform the jury that the bat was not the weapon used, but only a likeness. Prejudice from exposure to adverse pretrial publicity was not shown. Defendant was not entitled to a jury composed of those who would not follow the law or whose views concerning the death penalty would have tainted their impartiality.

The mobile home had been ransacked. The victim identified defendant as his assailant during a photographic line-up conducted four days later.

On appeal, defendant asserted numerous allegations of error, which were all rejected by the court in affirming his convictions. Defendant made two challenges to the delay in bringing his case to trial. The court held that defendant was tried within the 180-day period provided in Article III (a),(b),(c) of the Interstate Agreement on Detainers, Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1347 (1981), because the 180-period did not begin until the State filed its detainer. By agreeing to a continuance, defendant consented to the tolling of the time period. Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was not violated by the 484-day lapse in the filing of the information and the date of trial. Defendant was partially responsible for the delay. As for prejudice, he failed to offer proof to support his allegations of the deaths of two witnesses.</SPAN></P>

The trial judge very carefully examined defendant. Later, defendant filed an application to withdraw his guilty pleas within the time allowed. He was given a hearing at which the only evidence he offered was his own testimony which was an impeachment of his own prior testimony. Defendant had the burden of proving that his guilty plea was not voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently entered. However, the court found that he did not meet that burden. Defendant also claimed that the two prior convictions arose out of the same transaction or occurrence or series of events. Thus, he contended that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 51(B) (1981) was not applicable. This issue was not raised at the trial level, and the court found that there was no evidence that the two prior convictions were related incidents. The case numbers were not even close numerically. The fact that the convictions were entered on the same date and the sentences were ordered to run concurrently did not mean that the cases were related in the sense described in &sect; 51(B). Thus, the court found that this claim was groundless.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, while conducting outdoor religious revivals during which loud music was played, was cited for disturbing the peace after having been previously warned about the disturbance. The cite came under the City of Tulsa Rev. Ordinances tit. 27, &sect; 401(B), which prohibited the willful or malicious disturbance of the peace. Appellant was convicted and he appealed, contending that the ordinance was vague and overbroad, and unduly restricted the free exercise of his religion. On review the court noted that it was well within the City's discretion to regulate noise disturbances. Furthermore, the freedom of speech privilege was not an absolute privilege. The court noted that the ordinance gave fair warning of the nature of the proscribed act and the ordinance regulated the time, place, and manner of the expression, which was a legitimate regulation as it furthered significant government interests, i.e., maintaining the peace. The court also noted that the challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence was better left to the trier of fact, and the fact that appellant was in charge of the revival subjected him to the punishment as a principal, pursuant to Okla.

However, the court reversed the conviction for sodomy based on the finding that the State had failed proving the essential element of penetration. The court ruled that under Okla. Stat. tit. X, &sect; x (1981), the sodomy crime required sexual penetration, however slight. The court also held that the record showed that the child witness had been able to distinguish truth from fiction and was sworn under oath. The testimony had demonstrated her personal knowledge of the crime against her mother. The trial court's questions of the witness were proper and within its authority for interrogating a witness. An interpreter for the child, a deaf-mute, was not sworn, but defendant's right to have had the interpreter sworn under oath was waived. The right was waived because he knew and failed to object and also because he had not shown by direct examination or independent testimony that the interpretations were incorrect.

When the store employee reached for a nightstick under the counter, defendant fled and got into a waiting car. After his arrest, defendant confessed to police that he had planned to rob the store, but that he ran because he thought that the store employee was reaching for a weapon. Defendant was convicted of attempted robbery by force and was sentenced. Defendant appealed, arguing that his signed confession was involuntarily given, that the evidence was insufficient, and that the use of a previous trial transcript violated Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 106.4a, because he had no prior notice that the transcript had been prepared, he had not received a copy of it, and the transcript had been purchased with public monies. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that defendant's confession was voluntary because the police officer's statements did not amount to unconstitutional coercion. The court further held that sufficient evidence supported the judgment.

MICHAEL WAYNE GREEN an DANNY GEORGE PARKER, appellants, were convicted of Murdr in the First Degree in violation of 21 O.S.1981, &sect; 701.7, in the District Court of Pittsburg County, Oklahoma, Case No. F-81-120, sentenced to death by lethal injection, and appeal.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The evidence revealed that defendants, both of who were serving lengthy prison terms, brutally stabbed and killed another inmate with a butcher knife and a homemade weapon. A jury convicted each defendant of murder in the first degree. The trial court sentenced defendants to death by lethal drug injection. The court affirmed the convictions, but reversed the death penalty for one defendant. The evidence was insufficient to support the aggravated circumstance that one defendant had been previously convicted of a felony involving the use or threat of violence to the person under Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 701.12(1) (1981). That defendant's previous convictions for escape and kidnapping did not, without any other proof, show that he used or threatened force to commit these acts. A pre-accusation delay did not implicate the requirement of a speedy trial. Defendants did not show that they suffered actual prejudice by the delay to implicate the Due Process Clause. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants' motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence where another inmate's confession to the murder was inconsistent with other evidence.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the adjudication and held that while the clerk did not have probable cause to stop him, the evidence was admissible. The court held that the constitutional protection from search and seizures did not apply to a private action. The court found that neither Okla.

The court also held that &sect; 1344 was not unconstitutional and it did not create a presumption of probable cause in favor of the State if the accused individual was found in possession of stolen merchandise. The court found that the statute provided a presumption to protect the merchant from civil or criminal prosecution for false imprisonment.

The court affirmed the conviction, holding that &sect; 21 applied to inmates and non-inmates alike and therefore that there was no implied former felony conviction in the statute. The court further held that because the sentence then being served had already been passed when defendant was subsequently convicted for bringing alcohol into the prison, the trial judge properly concluded that he lacked the authority to order that the sentence run concurrently with the sentence then being served.

The court held that the order of contempt resulted from defendant's refusal to testify after a grant of immunity, not from the method by which the trial court decided the validity of her self-incrimination claim. Also, the grand jury was not convened by the District Attorney; it was convened by the District Judge, at the District Attorney's request, pursuant to the court's authority under the Oklahoma Constitution. Nothing precluded a District Attorney from making such a request.

The court said that while the prosecutor's conduct was inappropriate, prejudicial error did not occur. Finally, the court rejected defendant's claim that the convictions for the crime against nature could not stand because the statute prohibiting such acts, Okla.

Defendant then left. The wife managed to call the police. She lived to testify against defendant. Two days after the murder and shooting defendant went to his sister's house. The sister called the district attorney. He was then taken to the courthouse for interrogation where he confessed to the crimes. Defendant was convicted of crimes of murder in the first degree and shooting with intent to kill and sentenced to death for murder and 75 years of imprisonment for the shooting. On review, the court affirmed. The court held that, based on the testimony at trial on the motion to suppress the confession, the circumstances surrounding defendant's interrogation indicated that he was coherent, and doubtless knew that he was dealing with law enforcement officials.</SPAN></P>

Rather, the question was whether defendant could not with reasonable diligence have discovered the new evidence before the trial, the standard under 22 Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 952 (1981).

There was a legitimate security reason for separating defendant from the main jail population, and defendant's statements were not a product of coercion by the police.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State urged the court to overrule Johnson v. State, 665 P.2d 815 (Okla.

The court declined to do either. When the court handed down its decision in Johnson, the Oklahoma Legislature was still in session. The Oklahoma Legislature could have then, or in its most recent session, enacted a procedure for resentencing had it felt that the Court had misinterpreted the legislative intent. The Oklahoma Legislature did not do that. Thus, the court had to conclude that the Johnson interpretation was correct and that the court carried out the clear legislative intent.

The Supreme Court directed the courts to consider all relevant mitigating evidence and weigh it against the aggravating circumstances. Because the court did not weigh evidence, remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings. The trial court heard additional evidence and again imposed the death penalty. On appeal, the court held that it was error for it to remand to the trial court for resentencing and that the death sentence had to be modified to life imprisonment because when prejudicial error occurred in the sentencing stage of the trial only, the court had consistently modified the death sentence to life imprisonment. Because the court was without authority to remand jury-tried cases for resentencing, it also had to modify to life imprisonment cases where the trial court erred in imposing the death penalty.</SPAN></P>

Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 886 (1981) was unconstitutionally vague, citing to the theory of stare decisis. The court found that the evidence supported the trial court's finding that defendant engaged in unlawful oral copulation with the victim, in violation of &sect; 886 and Okla.

The crime occurred when the trooper stopped him for a routine traffic violation. After defendant was certified to stand trial as an adult, he waived a jury trial and entered a plea of nolo contendere. The trial court stated that it carefully considered all evidence offered by him in mitigation, then it made detailed findings concerning his childhood, background, and mental problems. The trial court later imposed the death penalty. The court affirmed the sentence. The United States Supreme Court reversed in part and remanded the conviction for further proceedings. The court remanded the case to the district court. Defendant sought a writ of prohibition, which was denied by the court. The district court heard additional evidence presented by defendant and again imposed the death penalty. The court affirmed the judgment, by holding that the trial court properly considered defendant's mitigating circumstances because it concluded not that his unfortunate childhood, his youth, and his family background were nonexistent, but that they were just not sufficient to offset the aggravating circumstances involved.</SPAN></P>

An ethical violation, standing alone, did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.

The court examined the voir dire of each disputed venireman and concluded that the trial court correctly excluded them because their answers clearly indicated their inability to consider the death sentence under any circumstances. Neither was it an error for the trial court to excuse a juror when it was revealed in mid-trial that she knew two of the witnesses; the trial court's holding that an alternate juror had already been selected and that defendant would not be prejudiced by the substitution of the alternate was done after a careful examination of the facts and was within the trial court's discretion.

Upon being convicted of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, a violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 63, &sect; 2-401(B)(2) (1975), defendant appealed, arguing that the warrant was unconstitutional in that it was not served during daylight hours. The court disagreed, noting that the warrant complied with Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1230 (1981), which permitted searches at any time of the day or night. Moreover, the warrant was not a general warrant by virtue of language extending to other persons or places, as the warrant limited the search to specific items at a certain address. Moreover, statements of the prosecutor concerning the warrant did not constitute evidence of other crimes and evidentiary harpoons, as defendant did not object to testimony at trial describing the pointing of a gun and as the statement did not meet the requirements of being an evidentiary harpoon, in that it was not voluntary and not calculated to cause prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The court also found that defendant was not entitled to a second preliminary hearing because the issue of his mental capacity and ability to assist counsel was not raised. Moreover, the original preliminary hearing did benefit defendant. The court further found that defendant should not have been treated as an insane person because of the necessity to use a drug treatment to &quot;normalize&quot; him. The court also found that defendant was not unfairly prejudiced by the admission of a photograph that showed how one of his victims was bound before being murdered. Defendant failed to establish any reasonable doubt as to his sanity at the time of the crime. The court also found that the death sentence was not excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

The Honorable Floyd L. Martin, District Judge.  Steven Keith Hatch, a/k/a Steve Lisenbee, appellant, was convicted in Canadian County District Court of two counts of Murder in the First Degree, and two counts of Shooting with Intent to Kill.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant raised numerous challenges to his convictions and the death sentences given him. Affirming the judgment as to the convictions, the court ruled that because he did not challenge the trial court's refusal to change venue in his motion for a new trial, he failed to preserve the claim for review. Defendant's argument that the trial judge was biased and thus, should have disqualified himself from the case, was rejected because defendant failed to utilized the statutory procedure for recusal set forth in Okla. Stat. tit. 20, &sect; 1403 (1981), to which strict compliance was necessary. The claim that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to follow the proper procedure to disqualify the trial judge was also rejected because defendant had not shown that the trial judge was biased. Based on the painstaking exam of defendant with respect to his waiver of a jury trial, his claim that the waiver was not knowingly and intelligently made was deemed frivolous. However, because the trial court failed to apply an individualized consideration of defendant's character and record in imposing the death sentences, they had to be vacated and the case remanded for re-sentencing.</SPAN></P>

The court further reasoned that a plain reading of the ordinance revealed that the enacting legislative body intended &sect; 511B(3) to constitute an independent public offense, separate from the earlier subsections prohibiting public drunkenness, so that a person could be punished for merely failing to leave public property once a peace officer demanded that he leave.

The officer pursued the fleeing taxi, and an officer was shot when shots were later fired by defendant. On appeal from his conviction, defendant claimed that he was denied his constitutional right of due process of law, as guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, because the trial court failed to certify him as a child, and that Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1104.2 (1981) created a presumption that he was an &quot;adult&quot; in the eyes of the law and shifted the burden to him to prove that he was a child. The court rejected this argument, finding that the statute was constitutional, and that it did not create such a presumption. The court also held that the classification created by the legislature had a rational relationship to an important governmental objective, i.e., protecting the public.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed. An information was filed on November 9, 1977. Thereafter, it was discovered that defendant was under 18 years of age, and on January 18, 1978, a certification hearing was ordered, which resulted in his certification to stand trial as an adult. The actions of the district court were in accordance with Okla. Stat. tit. 10, &sect; 1112 (1981). Defendant also alleged that he was denied his right to a speedy hearing. He relied upon a prior case in which the court found a 20 month delay to be a denial of the right to a speedy hearing. The court disagreed and found that the delay was six months as compared to 20 months in the other case. Furthermore, the reasons for the delay were that defendant spent 2 months in the hospital; he changed counsel; it was not readily ascertained that he was a juvenile; and one time his attorney was not present at the time the certification hearing had been scheduled. Moreover, defendant failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the delay.</SPAN></P>

The court held that a full evidentiary hearing under &sect;&sect; 1171-1174 as to defendant's competence was not required to meet the requirements of due process. Defendant was competent to waive a jury trial, and the trial judge had authority to conduct the trial without a jury. Defendant's privilege against self-incrimination was not violated because his admission that he killed the victim did not occur in a custodial interrogation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and his girlfriend entered a jewelry store, ostensibly to purchase a diamond engagement ring. The salesperson stated that when she asked if she could help them, defendant replied that, &quot;he wanted to see a round diamond in a carat-and-a-half size (1.5).&quot; The salesperson showed them two diamonds. After defendant and his girlfriend had left the store, the diamonds were weighed. What was supposed to be a 1.48 carat diamond was instead a synthetic cubic zirconium, weighing 2.67 carats. There was further testimony that a 2.60 carat cubic zirconium was equivalent in size to a 1.5 carat diamond, and whoever switched the diamond with the cubic zirconium was most probably aware of this fact. On appeal from a conviction for grand larceny after former conviction of three felonies, the court affirmed. The factual circumstances when considered together were inconsistent with the innocence of the accused and were sufficient to support a conviction on circumstantial evidence. Also, the mere fact that a codefendant attempted to escape punishment by inculpating the defendant was not a sufficient ground for severance. A motion for severance was within the discretion of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the State properly established the corpus delecti by evidence independent of defendant's statements. The court found that the trial court correctly refused to give an instruction on second degree murder because the evidence was insufficient to support a lesser included offense. The court ruled that there was no error in admitting the taped conversations because the informant had consented to the taping and the best evidence rule was not violated. The court concluded that the state death penalty statute was constitutional, that the sentence was not imposed under any arbitrary factor, that the evidence supported the finding of an aggravating circumstance, and that the sentence was not excessive or disproportionate.</SPAN></P>

On defendants' appeals from their convictions for robbery with a dangerous weapon, the court affirmed. The court first held that defendants' argument that Okla. R. Ct. Crim. App. 6 was unconstitutional was meritless because Rule 6 had previously been upheld and was not in conflict with Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1053 (1981). The officer had probable cause to make the warrantless arrest under Okla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The prisoner had been convicted of rape and sodomy and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1077 (1981) provided that bail on appeal was not allowed after conviction for rape. The prisoner claimed that the statute as applied to him was unconstitutional. The court rejected the claim and denied the prisoner the relief sought. There was no fundamental right to bail pending appeal, and so the rational basis test applied to determine whether the legislature's classification was related to a legitimate state interest. Because &sect; 1077 provided a rational means to insure that those persons convicted of the most serious of offenses would not flee by denying appeal bond, and the classification of offenses deemed serious enough to be included was not wholly irrelevant to that objective, there was no equal protection violation. The court also concluded that the statute was not void for vagueness, did not violate the separation of powers doctrine in Okla. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1 because there existed only a statutory right and no constitutional right to bail on appeal, and, as applied to the prisoner was not an unconstitutional ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>

After he was convicted, the State alleged 19 prior convictions of defendant for enhancement purposes. The court affirmed his conviction and sentence. Defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination was not violated by the trial judge's failure to give a special cautionary instruction to the jury regarding his decision not to testify in his own behalf. The defense failed to make a request for such an instruction. Admission of certain portions of defendant's penitentiary records to prove a former conviction under Oklahoma's Habitual Criminal Act, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 51 (1981), was not prejudicial. Nothing was admitted into evidence from the prison records except fingerprint cards and prison photographs, which was an acceptable method of proving identification. Because there was no proof that defendant had been represented by counsel for six prior convictions, the court struck such convictions. However, because 13 prior convictions were properly admitted, the effect of the admission of the six prior convictions was merely cumulative and did not require modification of his sentence.</SPAN></P>

Affirming, the court held that the victim was properly qualified to testify at trial because she was a competent witness pursuant to Okla. Stat. tit. 12, &sect; 2601 (1981). The court ruled that the testimony of the neighbor was admissible because it was not hearsay pursuant to Okla.

The magistrate found that in each case, Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 982A-1, A-2 (1981), were unconstitutionally vague and indefinite. The magistrate further found that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 981.4 (1981), which defined a &quot;gambling place&quot; to be unconstitutionally broad and vague. The magistrate also found the information to be so duplicitous as to be unclear and uncertain as to the offense allegedly committed. It was the district court judge's decision that Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 982 was so broad in its scope and vague in its application that it was unconstitutional. The court agreed that the district court was correct in finding that the offense described in each information stated an offense pursuant to Okla.

The contention that to be constitutional the statute had to specifically state a requirement of knowledge, intent, or guilty purpose was without merit.

The court held that defendant failed to object to the instruction or request an alternative instruction during trial. The court concluded the instruction was not so fundamentally defective as to deprive defendant of a fair and impartial trial. The question of his intent during the commission of the crime was established by overwhelming evidence. The court ruled that defendant did not request an instruction on voluntary intoxication, as the defense was not supported by the evidence; therefore, in light of the evidence of guilt, the instruction did not rise to the level of fundamental error. The court concluded that because defendant had three prior felony convictions, he was ineligible under Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 991(a)(B) (1980) for a suspended sentence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant shot and killed a store clerk during a robbery. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court affirmed the conviction and vacated the sentence. The court held that there was probable cause for defendant's warrantless arrest based on statements of defendant's friend. It was proper to exclude a juror who was irrevocably committed against the imposition of the death penalty. Statements made by the victim just prior to his death were admissible under the hearsay exception for excited utterances. Relevant evidence of other crimes by defendant was relevant at the punishment stage to enable the jury to determine whether to impose life imprisonment or the death penalty. However, the court vacated the sentence because certain evidence tending to show that another killing by defendant was in self-defense was improperly excluded. It should have been admitted in mitigation of the death penalty. The trial court also erred by admitting evidence of two other killings because the State failed to notify defendant prior to trial that it was going to use the evidence. Also, the aggravating circumstance that the murder was committed for remuneration was improper.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants sought bail pending appeal from their convictions for unlawful cultivation of marijuana and unlawful possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. Defendants requested issuance of a writ of habeas corpus for bail pending appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants had in their possession four tons of marijuana. The offenses for which defendants were convicted were not listed among those contained in Okla. Stat. tit. 22, &sect; 1077 (Supp. 1981), for which bail pending appeal was required to be denied. On review, the court rejected defendants' argument that the statute was unconstitutional for vagueness and denied the petitions. The court interpreted the statute as being a statement of legislative policy which left to the trial judge the exercise of his discretion whether or not bail pending appeal should be allowed. The trial judge, after having heard all the testimony and after considering all the evidence, and recognizing that the consequences of the offenses were of sufficient gravity to the general public, determined that bail pending appeal should be denied. The court held that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion when he denied bail. The court determined that the legislative intent expressed by &sect; 1077 left the matter of bail pending appeal within the discretion of the trial judge, except that the trial judge was required to state the reason why bail was granted in each case.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was convicted of keeping a disorderly house in violation of Okla. Stat. tit. 21, &sect; 1026 (1971). Defendant contended that the terms &quot;peace, comfort or decency&quot; were subject to multiple definitions and rendered &sect; 1026&nbsp;unconstitutionally vague and totally incomprehensible to a person of ordinary intelligence. On appeal, the court affirmed defendant's conviction and sentence. The court ruled that &sect; 1026 was not so vague as to be violative of due process. The court could not say that the activities emanating from or associated with the occupants or guests of defendant's residence did not in fact breach or disturb the peace or tranquility of the neighborhood as contemplated by &sect; 1026 or that a person of ordinary intelligence would not have known in advance that these activities were prohibited.</SPAN></P>
