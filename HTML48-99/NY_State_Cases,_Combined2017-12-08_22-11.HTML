</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was indicted on two counts of first-degree assault, first-degree unlawful imprisonment, and first-degree coercion. The trial court assigned counsel to defendant. Four months later, defendant requested and received a change of assigned counsel. Five months later, defendant again requested new counsel. The trial court refused the request and the second assigned counsel drew the jury. Defendant later appeared with retained counsel and the trial court permitted substitution. Defendant was convicted of assault and unlawful imprisonment. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that complainant's hospital records indicating the extent of injuries were properly received under the business records rule. The court also held that defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel because the retained trial lawyer did not select the jury. The court found that defendant freely chose to continue with retained counsel, although defendant was warned that retained counsel might not be as effective because it had not drawn the jury. The court also held that victim's loss of two front teeth was a permanent and serious injury under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 120.05(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County, entered January 31, 1979, affirmed insofar as appealed from, without costs or disbursements.  <BR></SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owners and respondents, County Board of Assessors and Board of Assessment, challenged a judgment from the Supreme Court at Special Term, Nassau County (New York), which had declared the latter three subdivisions of N.Y. Real Prop. Tax Law &sect; 307&nbsp;unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At principal issue on these cross appeals were the validity and effect of certain legislative enactments, which retroactively altered the means and standards by which aggrieved taxpayers could establish inequality of assessed valuations of real property. The underlying controversy involved the rates at which real property in the county were assessed; the appellate questions pertained to the constitutionality of laws, which would nullify petitioners' judicial success in establishing those rates as identical to the equalization rates fixed for Nassau County by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment, which the trial court found to be unconstitutional. The court affirmed. Petitioners, who owned a large commercial parcel, instituted proceedings to review its assessment, alleging that for the years in issue their property was assessed at a higher ratio to fair market value than other property in the county. They could not claim an unequal assessment as compared to all other taxpayers or seek to recover a refund because a tax levy had cast on him an unequal share of the total burden of all taxpayers.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment from the trial court that the latter three subdivisions of a portion of the New York Real Property Tax Law were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Assessment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Subdivisions 3, 4 and 5 of former section 307 of the Real Property Tax Law, which require inequality petitions to allege that the challenged assessments were made at a higher proportionate ratio to value than that of other property of the same major type, as defined by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment, and to offer evidence to such effect, are unconstitutional since although section 307 gives the appearance of merely regulating pleadings in tax review proceedings, it actually accomplishes a substantive remodeling of established law governing the imposition of taxes without further enabling legislation as to requisite details.  Section 307 requires proof of inequality predicated upon comparison to a particular class of property rather than all property within the district, and because its provisions were made applicable to all pending causes of action, the ultimate effect&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of the section is to increase or decrease the amount at which property could be initially assessed; accordingly, the statute has the effect of retrospectively sanctioning a tax on real property by class or type, which renders it unconstitutional as applied to tax years prior to its effective date. The prospective operation of the same subdivisions suffers from similar fatal deficiencies since the class system of taxation set forth in subdivision 3 of section 307 is not imposed uniformly against all taxpayers of the varying classes in the taxing district, but only upon those who have pursued a judicial remedy against the sovereign, and nowhere in the entire structure of the 1978 legislation can there be found statutory authority for the tax assessor to assess classes of property at varying rates.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owner sought review of a determination by the Commissioner of Public Works of the City of Syracuse, which recommended the condemnation of an avigation easement above the owner's property as requested by respondent city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city began condemnation proceedings for the purpose of eliminating the aviation hazard to the airport caused by the property owner's radio towers. The commissioner found that the taking was for a public use and recommended the condemnation of the avigation easement. The property owner petitioned for review. The court held that (1) the property owner was not denied procedural due process during the hearing, (2) N.Y. Em. Dom. Proc. Law did not violate substantive due process, (3) N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law. &sect; 355 gave the city the authority to condemn the right to unobstructed use of the airspace within 3,000 feet of a municipal airport, (4) the removal of the towers would have no environmental impact, (5) the determination and findings of the commissioner amply demonstrated that a public use would be served by the condemnation of the property owner's towers.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Avigation Easement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  The determination and findings of the Commissioner of Public Works of the respondent city, which recommended the condemnation of an avigation easement above petitioner's property due to the presence of radio towers located near the municipal airport, are proper where they were made in accordance with EDPL article 2.  The EDPL does not violate procedural due process inasmuch as the statute provides for a uniform procedure and requires public hearings, notice, publication of determinations and findings, and judicial review; the statute does not violate substantive due process since there is an applicable standard regarding the condemnation of property, i.e., land may only be taken for a public use.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Avigation Easement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  A municipality has the authority to condemn an interest in land outside its boundaries pursuant to section 355 of the General Municipal Law where such interest involves flight hazards which&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  lie within 3,000 feet of a municipal airport or within such greater distance as the Federal Civil Aeronautics Administration or its successor may declare to be necessary; section 355 also permits the municipality to condemn the right to unobstructed use of the airspace within the same distance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Avigation Easement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  In a proceeding concerning the condemnation of an avigation easement due to the presence of radio towers located near a municipal airport, the hearing officer made proper findings in regard to the environmental impact of the removal of the towers where such removal would have no environmental impact; furthermore, the hearing officer followed the requirement of EDPL 204 and stated the public use to be served by the easement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Eminent Domain -- Avigation Easement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  The determination and findings of the hearing officer, which recommended the condemnation of an avigation easement above petitioner's property due to the presence of radio towers located near a municipal airport, are proper where they amply demonstrate that a public use will be served by the condemnation; the determination of whether a taking of property is for a public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  use is a judicial question and the condemnation of land for an airport is for a public use. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner acquired title to land on both sides of a public highway. The landowner's deed described the land in separate parcel descriptions although all of it was contiguous except as bisected by the highway. The parcel on the northerly side of the road was divided into five lots, four being sold and the fifth being retained by the landowner. The town contended the division violated the subdivision regulations of the town. The landowner contended that the use of the word &quot;parcel&quot; as the description of land subject to subdivision was either too vague to encompass lands separately described in a deed or did not, as a matter of law, apply to her. The parties cross-appealed from the trial court's order and the court held that the words &quot;parcel of land&quot; were sufficient to convey the meaning of a contiguous area being subject to encompassment in a singular description of the land referred to at the time it is divided into five lots by its owner. The court held that the town was entitled to summary judgment declaring the regulations constitutional because the definition of a subdivision was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the landowner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent applicants sought to take a competitive written examination for the position of New York State trooper. Appellant, Superintendent of the New York State Police, refused to permit them to take the exam, relying on N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 215, subdiv. 3. The Supreme Court at Special Term in Albany County (New York) directed that the applicants be permitted to take the examination. The superintendent sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superintendent refused to permit the applicants to take the examination because they were over the age limit specified in &sect; 215, subdiv. 3. In addition, none of the applicants claimed any previous military duty that would extend the &sect; 215, subdiv. 3 age limit. The lower court ruled that in the absence of appropriate standards, the discretion conferred on the superintendent violated the equal protection clause of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 11. The court rejected this ruling and reversed the lower court's judgment. The court held that the applicants did not ask the superintendent to invoke his powers of discretion in their favor and that even if &sect; 215, subdiv. 3 represented an unlawful delegation of lawmaking power, the claimed deficiency would not benefit the applicants. Section 215, subdiv. 3 specified that no one over age 29 was eligible for appointment unless the superintendent, in the exercise of discretion, decided to extend that primary limitation. Because a declaration striking down this flexibility as unconstitutional would leave a proper maximum age limitation of 29 years fully intact, the court held that the applicants would still be ineligible for the examination.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The parent's son participated in an international gymnastic competition in violation of the athletic association's interscholastic sports rules and was declared ineligible to participate in the sport for the remainder of the season. The parent argued that the athletic association's actions stigmatized his son's reputation, thereby jeopardizing his liberty interests under the Due Process clause. The court affirmed, holding that participation in interscholastic high school competitions was not considered a substantial right unless the athletic association's denial of that right was based on an abuse of the son's fundamental rights or predicated on a suspect basis, e.g. religion or race. The court found that the denial was based on the son's violation of the athletic association's unambiguous rule. The athletic association did not act arbitrarily and capriciously because the son had participated in outside competition in violation of the athletic association's rule that prescribed a loss of eligibility, and no hearing was required on the part of the athletic association to find either a violation of the rule or to fix a sanction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2.  A CPLR article 78 proceeding is the appropriate remedy to compel private corporations to fulfill obligations imposed upon them by statute as well as by their internal rules.  The general rule is that one must exhaust available administrative remedies prior to seeking relief from a court of law; however, the exhaustion&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rule is not inflexible and need not follow when the action is challenged as either unconstitutional or outside of a grant of power, when resort to an administrative remedy would be futile or when its pursuit would cause irreparable injury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Participation of Students in Interscholastic Athletics</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Although an athletic association's actions may be deemed State action and cause injury to a student athlete, participation in interscholastic high school competitions is not a substantial right, and thus there is no violation of due process, unless denial of participation is based on an abuse of a student's fundamental rights or predicated on a suspect basis; a student athlete is not denied due process by having his good name and reputation jeopardized due to his being declared ineligible from participating in interscholastic sports where he waived his right to a factual hearing, neither presenting proof of harm, if any, nor utilizing the opportunity to purge any alleged stain on his name, and the athletic association provided a vehicle to review all questions of eligibility.</SPAN></P>

A student&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  athlete who had his privilege to participate in high school interscholastic athletics withdrawn due to a violation of an eligibility rule is not denied equal protection where the classifications in the rule are neither inherently suspect nor a violation of a fundamental right, but rather are grounded in and reasonably related to legitimate State interests.</SPAN></P>

The trial court signed the adoption order and subsequently denied the father's motion to vacate the adoption order. The court affirmed and held that the father could have insured his right to notice of the adoption proceeding by signing the putative father registry created by &sect; 111-a and N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 372-c. He failed to do so. Further, although N.Y. Dom. Rel.

The court affirmed, finding that the jurisdiction was personal and that the insurer, by its failure to raise the issue either by motion or by answer, waived the initial defect in jurisdiction under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211(e). Hence, the insurer had no right to file a motion to dismiss. It was plain that the purpose of the amendment to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 320(c) was not to alter the nature of the jurisdiction obtained, but rather to limit the liability flowing from an unconditional appearance in response to a warrant of attachment. Notwithstanding the limitation of liability to the face amount of the policy, the underlying jurisdiction remained personal because the appearance by the insurer was unconditional.

The administrator appealed and the court affirmed, holding that because actions to recover damages for wrongful death and conscious pain and suffering did not exist at common law and were created by legislative enactments, such enactments pre-empted the area, and as the rights accorded by statute were in derogation of the common law, the right to sue for injury sustained due to the death of another were founded in statutory authority. The court determined it was not free to consider the relative merits of arguments in favor of, or against, the limitations of damage recovery because the legislature had &quot;struck a balance&quot; for the court.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The child was placed with the hospital after his mother, who was now dead, attempted suicide. The father, who had spent time in mental hospitals, was employed and manifested a desire for custody of his child or to have custody turned over to the maternal grandmother. The father was excluded from the fact-finding hearing on the ground that only the parents whose consent to adoption under N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 111 was required were entitled to have been heard. Although &sect; 111(1)(c) stated that only the consent of the mother was required for adoption when the child was born out of wedlock, a recent decision held that &sect; 111(1)(c) was unconstitutional because it was a denial of equal protection. Thus, the father's exclusion from the fact-finding hearing was improper. Although the hearing was held prior to the recent decision, the court applied the decision retroactively because no reliance interest existed. No adoption had taken place. No familial or financial interests were jeopardized. All that was at stake was the father's right to participate in and to have been heard at all stages of a proceeding that might have led to the adoption of his child. Thus, the court reversed the judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the family court's decision, which excluded the father from participating in a fact-finding hearing that was brought by the hospital to obtain guardianship and custody of the father's child and to free him for adoption. The court remanded for a new hearing.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner property owners sought approval of respondent planning board for a proposed addition to an office building on their property. The board conditioned approval of the owners' site plan upon their consent to an easement burdening their property. The Supreme Court in Westchester County (New York) determined that this was within the planning board's power. Petitioners appealed from that judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The board had the responsibility of site plan review and conditioned its approval of the owner's proposed addition to their office space on the owners' consent to an easement. The court rejected the owners' argument that the board imposed an arbitrary condition upon them in their efforts to curb traffic congestion or that the condition constituted a compensable taking. The court found that 1) the board was authorized to approve the petitioners' site plan conditionally, and that the traffic congestion was a proper subject for the board's concern; 2) a police power reasonable relationship test had to be applied when scrutinizing the condition with respect to its effects upon the application for proposed development; 3) there was a reasonable relationship between the problem that would result from the effectuation of the application's proposed development and the conditional solution designed to alleviate it; and 4) the burdened property was capable of a reasonable return; however, the board's concept did not specify the means by which the intended result was to be achieved, which defeated the plan and consequently, the condition based thereon was vague and also had to be stricken.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the lower court finding that the board had the power to condition approval of the owners site plan on their consent to an easement.

The court found that the trial court did not make complete findings of fact to support its determinations. The court opted not to reverse and order a new trial, but to make the findings of fact and conclusions of law that the record supported. The court modified the general alimony provision for payment of all expenses related to the use of the marital residence. It addressed the indefiniteness of the provision by amending it to direct payment for specific items, including the mortgage, utility bills, taxes, and insurance. The court examined the parties' assets and income and reduced the weekly alimony and child support payments.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family court ordered the father pay the confinement expenses of the mother, up to a certain amount, and to pay weekly child support. The father appealed, arguing that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 514 was unconstitutional in that it violated the equal protection clauses of the New York State and United States Constitutions. The court held that when &sect; 514 was read in a gender-neutral manner, it authorized the family court to impose the obligation of paying for the confinement expenses of the mother of the child upon either the mother or father or both as the court, in its discretion, might deem proper. Thus, under &sect; 514, the family court was to consider the means and responsibilities of each parent without regard to the sex of the parent. Accordingly, there was no sex-based discrimination and &sect; 514 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The mother was a recipient of public assistance. Consequently, no useful purpose would be served by reversing the order and remanding the matter back to the family court for further proceedings to determine the means and responsibilities of both parties.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenant appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, Westchester County (New York), which denied the tenant's motion for summary judgment (except as to damages) and for class certification in her action against defendant warehouseman for a declaratory judgment that N.Y. U.C.C. Law &sect; 7-210(2) was unconstitutional, for an injunction, and for damages for the unlawful sale of her belongings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Under the direction of a city marshal, the warehouseman removed the tenant's belongings from the apartment from which the tenant had been evicted and stored them at its warehouse. When the tenant failed to pay storage charges, the warehouseman notified the tenant that it had imposed a warehouseman's lien and gave her a notice of sale of the belongings. After the tenant learned that the warehouseman sold her belongings, she brought the action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages on the ground that N.Y. U.C.C. Law &sect; 7-210(2), which purported to authorize the sale, violated the due process clause of N.Y. Const. art. I, &sect; 6. The tenant also sought to have her action certified as a class action. The court modified a trial court order to provide that the tenant's motion for summary judgment on the merits of her claim was granted. The statutory provision involved violated the state due process clause because it delegated exclusive sovereign power to resolve a dispute to the warehouseman, but failed to afford the tenant an opportunity for a hearing before the lien on her belongings was foreclosed. The denial of class action status was not an abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

Because the sexually oriented businesses were not engaging in the conduct prohibited by the resolution, they did not have standing to challenge the regulation. There was no merit the claim of the sexually oriented businesses that the resolution imposed sex-based discrimination. Because the sexually oriented businesses failed to establish standing in regard to any potentially justiciable issue, the court dismissed the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Zoning Resolution -- Vagueness</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A statute or ordinance proscribing designated activities must clearly define the activity so as to leave as little discretion as possible to the agency charged with its enforcement; failure to so draft a law lays it open to constitutional attack for vagueness on the principle that it invites arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.  However, section 12-10 of the New York City Zoning Resolution, which proscribes adult physical culture&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  establishments, described, with certain exceptions, as &quot;any establishment, club or business by whatever name designated which offers or advertises or is equipped or arranged so as to provide as part of its services, massages, body rubs, alcohol rubs, baths or other similar treatment by members of the opposite sex&quot;, is plainly designed and intended to preclude offering, advertising and providing cross-sexual massages and other similar treatment and does not rest the proscription on the mere presence of equipment, which could conceivably apply to a wide variety of otherwise legal business and residential premises, and, so read, the resolution is facially constitutional; moreover, the resolution can be construed by the State courts to eliminate any constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing -- Validity of Zoning Resolution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An action to declare a statute or regulation or resolution unconstitutional lies where a plaintiff concedes that his activity is proscribed by the statute or regulation or resolution as written or as it appears to be or is threatened to be interpreted and enforced, but the rule is otherwise where plaintiff specifically denies that his activity is within&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the proscribed parameters and, accordingly, plaintiffs, operators of &quot;leisure spas for men&quot;, lack standing to challenge the constitutionality of section 12-10 of the New York City Zoning Resolution, which proscribes adult physical culture establishments, described, with certain exceptions, as &quot;any establishment, club or business by whatever name designated which offers or advertises or is equipped or arranged so as to provide as part of its services, massages, body rubs, alcohol rubs, baths or other similar treatment, by members of the opposite sex&quot;, where plaintiffs, in the affirmations in support of motions for declaratory and injunctive relief, state that they are not presently advertising or offering cross-sexual physical services and that the only massage services now being provided by plaintiffs are by licensed masseurs, since, if that is the case, plaintiffs are no longer operating such proscribed establishment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Validity of Zoning Resolution</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The constitutionality of the use of zoning resolutions to restrict massage parlors where massages are given to members of the opposite sex has been upheld in the highest courts of other States, with the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  United States Supreme Court dismissing the appeals for lack of a substantial Federal question; such dismissals constitute adjudications on the merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Commercial Advertising</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Commercial advertising is not entitled to constitutional protection where the subject matter of the advertising is itself illegal and subject to regulation. Accordingly, where plaintiffs, operators of &quot;leisure spas for men&quot;, challenge the constitutionality of section 12-10 of the New York City Zoning Resolution, which proscribes adult physical culture establishments, described, with certain exceptions, as &quot;any establishment, club or business by whatever name designated which offers or advertises or is equipped or arranged so as to provide as part of its services, massages, body rubs, alcohol rubs, baths or other similar treatment by members of the opposite sex&quot;, their constitutional attack is without merit if they are advertising such proscribed use; on the other hand, if they are no longer offering cross-sexual massages, as they claim, they lack the standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute on the free speech aspect of the resolution. &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The resolution must be read as allowing advertising to be used as evidence of the use of the property, not as authorizing closing solely on the basis of the content of the advertising.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Rights -- Discrimination Based on Sex</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The proscription in section 12-10 of the New York City Zoning Resolution against premises providing commercial massages for patrons of the opposite sex is not sex-based discrimination, since the resolution does not prohibit the hiring of massagists of either sex.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Time Limitations for Removal of Nonconforming Uses</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A time limitation on removing a nonconforming use is reasonable where the public gain to be achieved by such exercise of the police power will outweigh the private loss to the owner of the establishment conducting such activity; a balance must be found between social harm and private injury.  Accordingly, the reasonableness of one-year amortization period to eliminate establishments offering massages and similar treatments to members of the opposite sex (NY City Zoning Resolution, &sect; 12-10), is not amenable to preliminary injunctive relief, where the potential benefit to the community&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has been clearly demonstrated by statistics which link the burgeoning massage parlor trade and illegal prostitution, a development which is detrimental to the public and the exercise of legitimate business enterprise in the city; if plaintiffs have standing to show injury, the reasonableness of the time period might be subject to trial.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants approved a bank's relocation application. Plaintiff filed an action, seeking a declaration that certain rules of defendant board were unconstitutional. The trial court granted plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. On appeal, the court modified the trial court's order to the extent of granting defendants' cross-motions to dismiss plaintiff's first and second causes of action. The court noted that the approval of the application was an administrative act subject to review pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78. Plaintiff's first and second causes of action were barred by the four- month limitation period found in N.Y. C.P.L.R. 217 because they were filed two years after they accrued. However, plaintiffs' third cause of action was commenced within the four-month limitations period. Because the elements of the first and second causes were impliedly present in the surviving cause of action, resolution by the trial court was proper. However, the court held that pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 6301 a preliminary injunction did not lie against defendants because they had already acted to the full extent of their powers and no further action in regard to the application was required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The contractors executed public works contracts. All of the applicants were informed that the wage obligations were susceptible to increase before they submitted their bids. The contractors maintained that the redetermination clause was an impairment of the contractual obligations of the contractors. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, concluding that the redetermination clause was both reasonable and appropriate because passing the risk of rising costs onto the contractor tended to insure that the state's monetary exposure was conclusively determined at the outset of the project, which precluded the need to repeat the costly and bothersome appropriations process whenever there was an increase of the wage rate. The court explained that it was only fair to place the risk of rising labor costs on the contractor who was intimately familiar with the construction market and would have been better equipped to estimate future costs. The court determined that all of the parties agreed in advance that the contractors would have paid all wage increases without reimbursement from the government, which was not violative of any principles of contract law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant attorney challenged an interlocutory judgment of the Supreme Court of Nassau County, Special Term (New York) which held that defendant and plaintiff attorney were entitled to an accounting of partnership fees and expenses in plaintiff's action for an accounting after the dissolution of defendant and plaintiff's law partnership. After trial, the trial court found that the parties had agreed to divide postdissolution fees equally.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After 12 years as law partners, plaintiff attorney and defendant attorney agreed to dissolve their partnership. Plaintiff filed an action against defendant for an accounting of postdissolution partnership fees and expenses. The court entered an interlocutory judgment that the parties were entitled to an accounting and found after a bench trial that the parties had agreed to divide postdissolution fees evenly. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed. The trial court's determination of credibility issues and its conclusion that the parties had agreed upon an equal division of fees was supported by the record. A clean hands analysis did not mandate reversal of the interlocutory judgment. The parties stipulated that the trial would be concerned only with the issue of what their partnership agreement was, and intended that stipulation to be exclusionary of all other issues. Strong public policy in favor of stipulations indicated that they had the power to waive the clean hands defense. Defendant therefore could agree to refrain from raising the clean hands defense to defeat plaintiff's equity claim and the trial court had the power to enforce that agreement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff company sought review of the order of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Monroe County (New York), which denied its motion for summary judgment to declare N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company operated 32 retail stores, which sold food, related grocery products, and general merchandise. The company had voluntarily provided a computerized unit price information in all of its stores. Subsequently, defendant state enacted &sect; 214-h, which required certain retailers to provide unit price information to their customers. The statute originally covered only three categories of consumer commodities that were commonly found in food stores. The company did not contest this regulation. However, a fourth category of consumer commodities subject to unit pricing was added, including non-prescription drugs, female hygiene products, and toiletries. Many of the company's competitors were exempted from the requirement. The lower court later denied the company's motion for summary judgment to declare the statute unconstitutional and to enjoin its enforcement. The court affirmed the order, holding that the company did not meet its burden of demonstrating an unconstitutional interference with its right to due process because the required unit pricing was logically and actually related to the valid public purpose of providing consumers with comparison shopping data.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Only a minimal level of rationality is necessary to save an economic regulatory statute from constitutional attack on due process grounds; moreover, one challenging a statute on these grounds must overcome a heavy presumption of constitutionality.  Accordingly, the requirement of unit pricing of certain nonprescription drugs, female hygiene products and toiletries in food stores ( Agriculture and Markets Law, &sect; 214-h) does not constitute an unreasonable interference with petitioner food store chain's business activities in violation of its right to due process; the requirement is logically and factually related&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the valid public purpose of providing consumers with comparison shopping data, the Legislature could reasonably have concluded that unit pricing promotes accurate price information and enables the shopper to reduce his expenses and the Legislature found, based upon research, that the costs of complying with the statute would be minimal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Unit Pricing </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statute</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Equal Protection of Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An economic regulation challenged on equal protection grounds is presumed constitutional and requires only that the challenged classification be rationally related to a legitimate State interest; in the area of economic regulation, only invidious discrimination, the wholly arbitrary act, runs afoul of constitutional guarantees.  Accordingly, petitioner food store chain failed to meet its burden of proof on its claim that the provision of section 214-h of the Agriculture and Markets Law requiring unit pricing of nonprescription drugs, female hygiene products and toiletries sold in food stores, which products are available to purchasers in unregulated retail and drug stores, violates its right to equal protection in that it treats food stores and other stores selling&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  identical products differently, where petitioner provided no economic data to overcome the basic premise behind the legislation, that people spend a significant amount of their consumer dollar in supermarkets and that it is there that they need the most protection; the legislative determination to include only food stores in the regulatory scheme, while underinclusive, is not unreasonable.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Due process requires a sufficient degree of precision in legislation to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute, which requirement also protects against arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by establishing boundaries sufficiently distinct for police, Judges and juries to fairly administer the law; statutes are not automatically invalidated on the ground of vagueness simply because of difficulty in determining whether certain marginal activities fall within the scope of the statutory regulations, and an interpretation which supports the constitutionality of the legislation is preferred.  Accordingly, the term &quot;food store&quot;, used in the statute requiring&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  unit pricing of certain goods sold in such stores and defined as a store &quot;selling primarily food&quot; ( Agriculture and Markets Law, &sect; 214-h), based on total dollar volume of food sales ( 1 NYCRR 345.5 [b]), provides a sufficient degree of clarity to satisfy the requirements of due process; moreover, with respect to the use of the term &quot;toiletries&quot; in the statute to indicate a type of product sold in food stores that must be unit priced, that term's dictionary meaning, articles used in bathing, dressing and grooming, is sufficiently precise.  </SPAN></P>

On appeal, the husband contended, inter alia, that the alimony statute,&nbsp;N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 236, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband argued that the wife failed to show a sufficient showing of a change in circumstances to prove her likelihood of becoming a public charge. The husband also argued that N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect;&sect; 412, 442, 466 and N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law &sect; 236 were unconstitutional because they violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court found that the wife met her burden of proof for obtaining an increase in support because she showed: (1) an increase in her needs and in the husband's means; and (2) that her financial change of circumstances was for the worse and the husband's financial change were for the better. The court further found that &sect; 236 of the Domestic Relations Law was sex based and violated the Equal Protection Clause. The court concluded, however, that &sect; 236 could be purged of its sex-based discrimination because the statute could be read in a gender-neutral manner, making it applicable to either spouse and affording equal eligibility for alimony to both spouses. Section 236, as preserved, supplied the power to modify the support provisions of the divorce decree. Accordingly, the order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The former resident lived in the nursing home.

When the statute was declared constitutional, the owners returned most of the money. The former resident filed an action against the owners for compensatory and punitive damages and a declaratory judgment forbidding the owners from charging rent in excess of her benefits. The nursing home filed a motion for summary judgment. The trial court granted summary judgment for the damages, but dismissed the declaratory judgment. On cross appeals, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court. The court determined that the statute forbade withholding supplemental funds, that statutes are presumptively constitutional, and that the good faith withholding violated the statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In May 1978, the hospital increased its charges to private patients.

On appeal, the commissioner argued that the amendment required all rates to have been frozen as of their May 1, 1978 level. The court modified the summary judgment. In doing so, the court held that contrary to the decision of the lower court, whose interpretation was selected for its grammatical accuracy, the clearly expressed intent of the New York Legislature was to contain &quot;hospital costs,&quot; and in order to accomplish such a purpose the May 1 date should have been held to modify &quot;charges for in-patient care services&quot; and not &quot;services&quot; only. Accordingly, the charges must have been frozen at the May 1, 1978 level. The court further held that the conclusion did not mean that the amendment had retroactive application because lacking legislative indication of retroactivity, the statute spoke as of its effective date, July 24, 1978, and applied to and affected only the charges incurred on and from July 24, 1978 through December 31, 1978, freezing such charges at the May 1, 1978 rate level.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Kings County Supreme Court (New York), entered upon a jury verdict, convicting him of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon after the trial court, inter alia, failed to sua sponte charge the jury on a potential defense of intoxication, following testimony that defendant, on the night in question, had consumed approximately 40 alcoholic drinks.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At defendant's murder trial, two prosecution witnesses testified that they saw defendant carefully shoot the victim several times in an occupied drinking establishment and then bury the body in the cellar of the bar. Defendant testified that he was not involved. Although he claimed he had consumed about 40 alcoholic drinks that night, he further testified he was not drunk. Defendant requested a manslaughter instruction, but he did not request a jury instruction on an intoxication defense. Neither instruction was given, and he was convicted. Defendant appealed, claiming, inter alia, that the failure of the trial court to charge the jury on an intoxication defense was reversible error. In affirming, the court rejected defendant's argument and ruled that defendant could not interject hindsight into the proceedings to upset a properly obtained conviction. Defendant had made a reasoned decision not to pursue an intoxication defense in favor of an absolute denial, so presenting the intoxication issue to the jury was not justified. However, even if the jury had been so instructed, intoxication did not necessarily negate the ability of defendant to form the intent to kill.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The convictions were affirmed because defendant did not request an intoxication instruction and hindsight could not be interjected into the appeal to upset a properly obtained conviction. The court held that the positions taken by defendant at trial did not justify the presentation of an intoxication factor to the jury since he had made a reasoned decision not to pursue that course.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed from the decision of the Supreme Court, Erie County (New York), which denied its motion for summary judgment in its action against defendant city constitutionally challenging the amount of taxes collected by the city.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer brought an action for refunds for taxes illegally collected by the city in excess of its constitutional limits. The taxpayer brought a motion for summary judgment, which was denied by the trial court. The basis for denial was that the taxes had not been shown to be collected illegally inasmuch as the statute that authorized collection of the taxes, 1976 N.Y. Laws ch. 349, 484, had not been explicitly declared unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed. The issue involved a complicated tax assessment ratio. The court concluded that the burden to establish the constitutionality of the ratios should not be on the taxpayer. To find the city had established a question of fact created a monumental burden of proof requiring the taxpayer to prove the full value of all property in Buffalo during the years 1970-1977. Such a trial would consume enormous resources from both of the parties and the trial court without producing an appreciable gain in the accuracy of the ratios established. It imposed no undue hardship upon the city to require it to do what the taxpayer could not do and challenge the ratios directly in an administrative proceeding created for that very purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The New York Supreme Court (New York) granted plaintiff husband a divorce and custody of the children. In a countersuit resolved in the same judgment, the wife was granted a divorce and the trial court found the separation agreement between the parties unfair. The husband appealed from so much of the judgment as voided the separation agreement and ordered him to pay his wife's counsel fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The husband filed a petition for divorce on the grounds of adultery and cruel and inhuman treatment. The wife filed her own petition for divorce in a countersuit on the grounds of the husband's cruel treatment. The trial court granted the wife's petition and voided the separation agreement between the parties, finding that it was unfair. The husband appealed, and the court modified and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court applied the best interest test and affirmed the trial court's determination that the children should be with the husband. The court also affirmed the trial court's award of attorney fees to the wife, rejecting the husband's argument that the statutory provision for attorney fees was discriminatory against men. The court modified the trial court's judgment, however, in that it voided the separation agreement. The court held that the agreement was the subject of extensive bargaining between the parties in which the wife had the advice of her minister and lawyer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court voiding the couple's separation agreement and awarding the wife counsel fees was modified and affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Separation Agreement</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A husband's failure or refusal to disclose his financial circumstances when he executes a separation agreement with his wife is not sufficient to void an agreement fair on its face, particularly when the wife was represented by counsel during the negotiations and execution.  Accordingly, the court erred in granting defendant wife's application to rescind a provision in a separation agreement as unconscionable based on the disparity between the consideration paid to her to convey her interest in the marital home and the value of her share of the equity, which disparity was allegedly the product of her husband's overreaching through nondisclosure, where the agreement was the subject of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  extensive negotiation during conferences in which defendant had the advice of her minister and her lawyer, she complied with its terms for almost a year, she knew the original cost of the house as well as the approximate value of the house when the agreement was drawn, she knew of her husband's general financial condition and the agreement as a whole represents a bargain which someone in her position might reasonably accept in an effort to resolve her marital difficulties, since, even if it could be said that the husband failed in some duty of good faith, his wife was not misled and did not rely upon his misconduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Custody</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a proceeding involving two natural parents, custody is to be determined solely by what is in the best interest of the child and the disposition of the trial court should not be reversed in the absence of manifest error or an abuse of discretion.  Accordingly, although generally when children have been living with one parent for a long period of time and the parties have previously agreed that custody shall remain in that parent, their agreement should prevail and custody should be continued unless it is demonstrated that the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  custodial parent is unfit or perhaps less fit, where the parents' separation agreement did not address or resolve long-term custody of the children, Trial Term proceeded correctly when it declined to give controlling weight to the provisions of the separation agreement giving custody to the mother or to the fact that the children had previously lived with their mother after their father moved out of the house and, applying the best interests of the child test, awarded custody to the father.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parent and Child -- Custody</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A wife's adultery does not, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">ipso facto,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warrant her loss of custody of the parties' children.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Divorce -- Counsel Fees</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The United States Supreme Court decision declaring an Alabama statute similar to section 237 of the Domestic Relations Law, which authorizes the award of counsel fees in an action for annulment, separation or divorce only in favor of the wife, to be unconstitutional because it violates the equal protection clause, is binding on the New York courts and shall be applied prospectively; moreover, a husband who did not challenge the constitutionality of section 237 at trial has standing to raise the issue&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  on appeal.  However, section 237 is construed to be gender neutral, authorizing relief to either spouse when appropriate, and, accordingly, an award of counsel fees to the wife under section 237 is upheld on a finding that, on the evidence, the statute was not unconstitutionally applied.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the decision of the Supreme Court, Kings County (New York), which convicted defendant, upon a conditional guilty plea, of reckless endangerment in the first degree and criminal possession of two weapons. Defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to establish the elements of reckless endangerment and that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 265.15(3)'s statutory presumption was unconstitutional as applied to his case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although defendant admitted the facts underlying the charges against him during the allocution, defendant's guilty plea was conditioned upon his ability to raise two issues on appeal. Defendant asked the court to determine whether the requisite elements of reckless endangerment in the first degree were satisfied by the proof available to the prosecution and whether &sect; 265.15(3)'s statutory presumption of weapons possession was constitutional as applied to the facts of his case. The court reversed and remanded to give defendant an opportunity to plead again finding that the issues were not reviewable. The court determined that defendant's appeal sought review of issues of factual guilt, which was inconsistent with his admission of factual guilt. Therefore, the court found that his appeal was not logically or legally consistent with his guilty plea. The court also concluded that the limited plea record was insufficient for the court to determine whether &sect; 265.15(3)'s statutory presumption was unconstitutional as applied. The factual issues regarding the location of defendant's guns in the car and his ability to reach them from the driver's seat required resolution at a trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction and remanded to give defendant the opportunity to plead anew because he was foreclosed from raising factual issues of guilt on appeal and because his conditional guilty plea was given in reliance on his ability to pursue the appellate remedy that he attempted to preserve.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Plea of Guilty -- Appeal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Where a defendant, pursuant to an agreement with the District Attorney, entered a conditional plea of guilty to several counts of an indictment against him and preserved for appeal issues as to the sufficiency of the facts alleged to constitute one of the charges against him and the constitutionality of the presumption of possession of weapons in subdivision 3 of section 265.15 of the Penal Law as applied to the facts in the case, the judgment of conviction is reversed and the matter remanded to give defendant the opportunity to plead anew as the appeal is not properly before the Appellate Division; conditional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  pleas which attempt to preserve issues which lose their relevancy once the defendant has asserted his factual guilt are precluded, and the State's statutory scheme has provided an expansive approach to appealability by preserving the right to raise postplea objection where suppression motions asserting claims of illegally obtained or improperly tainted evidence have been denied.  Defendant is seeking a review of issues of factual guilt following an admission of factual guilt and the appeal is not logically or legally consistent with the plea; on the limited record it could not be determined whether the statutory presumption was unconstitutional as applied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Plea of Guilty -- Appeal</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. As a general rule, a plea of guilty, intelligently and voluntarily entered, operates as a waiver of certain fundamental constitutional defects and bars the later assertion of constitutional challenges to pretrial proceedings; therefore, only those issues fully disclosed in the record which relate either to the exercise of jurisdiction by the court or to the voluntary and knowing nature of the plea are appealable after a plea of guilty. Since a guilty plea is not merely a confession&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  but is itself a &quot;conviction&quot;, objections which go to the factual finding of guilt and not either to the right of the People to prosecute or to the validity of the plea itself are deemed waived by such a plea.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The customer was injured when a defect in her shoe caused her to fall. The customer sought personal injury damages from the retailer and the distributor. The retailer and the distributor brought third party complaints against the manufacturer. The trial court denied the manufacturer's motion to dismiss. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that N.Y. C.P.L.R. 302(a)(3)(ii) allowed the trial court to exercise personal jurisdiction over the manufacturer. Under their business arrangement, the distributor solicited the sale from the retailer and then contracted with the manufacturer for the shoes. The manufacturer had no sales department and only manufactured those shoes that were ordered by the distributor. The court found that the manufacturer relied on this relationship in order to insulate itself from in personam jurisdiction in the state. The evidence established that the manufacturer had ties to interstate commerce with the reasonable expectation of forum consequences in the state resulting from the anticipated and intended sale of its products to consumers within the state. Therefore the due process requirements of minimum contacts and substantial fairness were satisfied.</SPAN></P>

The market picked up milk at the milk dealer's premises and transported it back to its store for resale and did not qualify for the exemption from licensing because it transported milk to a store. Nevertheless, the market was exempt and, therefore, the milk dealer did not commit an unauthorized sale. The milk dealer also contended &sect; 257(3) was unconstitutional on its face and in its enforcement arguing that there was no rational basis for its limitations and no public interest being served by so restricting the sale of milk to a retailer for subsequent sale at its own store, and further, that the section was unconstitutionally vague.

The court held that to permit the county to appeal an enforceable dispositional order of the family court for the purpose of having the severity of the order increased, would violate the Double Jeopardy clause of U.S. Const. amend. V. The court noted that the juvenile had already fully suffered one of the alternative punishments for his offense and held that the courts had no power to punish him further. Even in the absence of a fully executed dispositional order, the court held that an appeal by the county challenging the leniency of an order of disposition was barred by the double jeopardy clause, at least in the absence of a statute expressly providing for such a right as an adjunct to an appeal by the juvenile contesting the propriety of the dispositional order.</SPAN></P>

The court held that it was error to rely on a case that had since been overturned to declare the statutory presumption unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The estate brought a replevin action to recover corporate stock certificates and other assets formerly possessed by the testator and now held by the executor.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, union members and officials, appealed the judgment of the Supreme Court (New York), which granted injunctive relief in favor of plaintiff employer in a labor dispute. The employer had sought to restrain the members and officials from obstructing egress and ingress into its plant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The uncontradicted testimony of the employer's witnesses was replete with instances of unlawful acts such as rock throwing, tire puncturing, and tire slashing by the union members during a labor dispute. The union members and officials appealed the grant of injunctive relief, assigning as error the trial court's jurisdiction, the extent of the restraints, and the finding that the union members and officials were responsible for the acts complained of. The court affirmed, with minor modification. The court held that the record amply justified relief. The trial court's recitation of facts did not pose a jurisdictional problem under N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 807(1) because the trial court's power to render a judgment on the merits was unaffected by its failure to comply with the statute. The record was sufficiently complete to permit the court to make the necessary findings of fact. The court modified the restraints ordered with respect to the number of persons allowed at a tent area and the length of the injunction. Finally, the record supported the trial court's findings that the union, its officers, and members had engaged in the unlawful acts.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the appeals by the union members and officials, without costs or disbursements. The court resettled the judgment below and modified, on the law, by deleting two paragraphs and by adding a provision that the injunction was to remain in effect for no more than six months from the date of the signing of the original judgment. As so modified, the resettled judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Jurisdiction -- Injunctive Relief in Labor Disputes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Upon an action for an injunction in a labor dispute, the Supreme Court's failure to comply with subdivision 1 of section 807 of the Labor Law, which directs that findings of fact be filed in the record of a case, is not a jurisdictional defect and the court has the power to render a judgment on the merits; however, the requirement of subdivision 1 of section 807 is important for enlightenment of the parties and for effective review on appeal.  Furthermore, the Appellate Division has the power to make any necessary findings if the record of the case is complete, even if the trial court failed to state the essential facts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Matters Appealable -- Findings of Fact by Appellate Division</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. An appeal lies from a denial of a motion which sought to modify the recital portion of a resettled judgment, and while the granting of plaintiff's motion to resettle in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  its entirety would have aided the Appellate Division in determining if the essential facts found by the trial court support the relief granted, where the record is sufficiently complete the Appellate Division can make the necessary findings of fact and, therefore, reversing an order denying specific fact finding and resettlement would serve no purpose.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Correction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A motion to resettle a judgment is not untimely under CPLR 4405 as a posttrial motion under CPLR 4404 (subd [b]) to make new findings of facts or render a new decision where the defect was not substantive since the motion is more properly characterized as a motion to correct an irregularity pursuant to CPLR 5019 (subd [a]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Jurisdiction -- Injunctive Relief in Labor Disputes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Although certain labor union activities are protected by Federal law, the State has the power to enjoin breaches of the peace and threats to public safety; accordingly, a trial court's jurisdiction in an action for an injunction in a labor dispute involving acts of violence is limited by section 807 of the Labor Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor -- Injunctions in Labor Disputes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The restraints imposed by&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the trial court, i.e., that only five pickets could be stationed at a site near the entrance to the employer's plant and that these pickets had to move to the roadside upon the approach of vehicular traffic absent a voluntary stop by the driver of a vehicle to inquire about the strike, were reasonable considering the terms of the injunction, which prohibited the pickets from hindering the ingress to or egress from the employer's plant, the threatening or committing of violence upon plant employees or guests, and the committing of any property destruction, with specific reference to the throwing of objects and the placing of nails so as to damage tires, and given the traffic-stopping tactics of the pickets and the expressed safety concerns of local police authorities about tie-ups at the intersection.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor -- Injunctions in Labor Disputes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. A modification of a judgment is required where it does not conform with the requirement of subdivision 8 of section 807 of the Labor Law, which provides that no permanent injunction issued in a labor dispute shall remain in force for more than six months from the date on which the judgment is signed; the purpose of the limitation is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to assure that restraints are made only after a recent hearing.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of the felony of attempted criminal possession of a dangerous drug in the fourth degree. Thereafter, defendant entered a guilty plea to the felony of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, with an agreed-sentence.

Defendant filed a motion to set aside his sentence insofar as he was sentenced as a predicate felon. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, the court affirmed the sentence and the order. The court held that &sect; 70.06 was rationally related to a legitimate legislative purpose. The statute worked a harsher result on those with a prior state felony conviction than those who previously carried out their illicit conduct elsewhere, but the legislature could have determined within acceptable constitutional dimensions that it wished to be more severe with those who consistently violated the laws of the state.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two oil companies owned and operated self-service gasoline stations in the town, which complied with all applicable safety regulations. The town board enacted an ordinance that prohibited the installation and use of self-service gasoline stations anywhere in the town. The town brought an action against one oil company to enjoin its operation of a self-service station, and the other oil company brought an action against the town to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance. The actions were consolidated for trial. The trial court upheld the validity of the ordinance and the oil companies sought review. The court held that: (1) legislative enactments were presumed to be constitutional, and while the presumption was rebuttable, unconstitutionality had to be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt; (2) an ordinance was required to be reasonably related to some manifest evil which need only be reasonably apprehended; (3) the town was entitled to regulate the use of flammable substances, N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state senator filed an action for libel and slander against defendants, a newspaper reporter and newspaper.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The senator contended that the verdicts were consistent with the law and the evidence and must be sustained. The reporter sought to overturn the verdicts as inconsistent with the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the press. The court held that the issue of whether the headline was defamatory was properly submitted to the jury. The court held that the verdict against the reporter carried the implicit finding that he had played some part in the formulation of the headline, and the court could not say that that finding was without support in the record. The evidence was sufficient to sustain the jury's determination that the reporter acted as the agent of the paper and within the scope of his employment, had composed a defamatory headline with actual knowledge that the matter asserted therein was false. The court held that the publication of the reading of the article on the senate floor was protected by a principle of overriding importance embodied in New York statutory law as an expression of the state's public policy. The court held that the public's right to know outweighed the individual rights of the senator, with the result that the article was absolutely privileged.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. In an action based on libel and slander, the court is not bound to search out and apply any possible innocent construction of the words alleged to be defamatory inasmuch as the function of the court in matters such as these is twofold: first, it must determine whether the statement complained of reasonably permits the construction urged by the plaintiff and, if it does, then it is for the jury to decide whether that was the sense in which the statement was likely to be understood by the ordinary and average reader; and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  second, the court must determine whether there is a reasonable basis to find that the meaning ascribed to the statement is actionable. Finally, where the plaintiff is a public official, he must bear the additional burden of demonstrating by proof of convincing clarity that the defamatory matter was published with malice.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A verdict in favor of plaintiff State Senator upon a cause of action for libel regarding a false headline appearing in defendant newspaper from which the jury could reasonably conclude that plaintiff believed blacks ought to be excluded from participating in the administration of an important urban renewal project should be sustained where there was evidence that the headline was published with malice inasmuch as a legislator's reputation and standing in the community could be seriously damaged by such a suggestion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- Libelous Headline</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In an action for an allegedly libelous headline appearing in a newspaper, whether such headline constitutes a statement of fact or opinion is a question of law to be determined by the court; accordingly, where a headline plainly purports to state a fact, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  not an opinion, the trial court should have so ruled as a matter of law, but its failure to do so does not warrant reversal of a verdict for plaintiff since that failure actually redounded to the defendants' benefit by permitting the jury to find that the headline represented a protected opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- Libelous Headline -- Actionable Words</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In an action regarding allegedly libelous headlines, the trial court should charge the jury that defamatory headlines are actionable though the matter following is not, unless they fairly indicate the substance of the matter to which they refer, and unless they are a fair index of the matter contained in a truthful report; if the headline is a fair index of an accurate article, it is not actionable and if it is not a fair index, then the headline must be examined independently to determine whether it is actionable under general principles of libel; that the defamatory meaning of the headline may be dispelled by a reading of the entire article is of no avail to the publisher inasmuch as a headline is often all that is read by the casual reader.</SPAN></P>

On appeal from summary judgment in favor of the Department, the court reviewed the decision to require fencing an indoor swimming pool. In reversing, the court noted the rule under N.Y. Comp.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city imposed a tax that was later found illegal because it exceeded the two-percent cap found in the state constitution. The city was ordered to pay refunds to those taxpayers who had paid the tax under protest. Instead, the city passed Rochester, N.Y., Ordinance 97-307, which granted refunds to all taxpayers, imposed a special levy to pay the refund, and showed the refund as a credit of the levy amount. The taxpayers sought a refund of the unconstitutional taxes and protested the scheme of the ordinance. The trial court granted summary judgment to the taxpayers and held the ordinance unconstitutional. The court affirmed, holding that the refunds were only allowed to be paid to those who had overpaid the tax in the earlier tax year, not to taxpayers in the year of the special levy. The computation of the levy never actually resulted in a return of the illegal tax but was a refund of the levy itself. In addition, the levy was subject to the two-percent limitation, which it exceeded, and the city was only authorized to collect funds by special levy to pay particular claims or judgments, not those of the city's taxpayers at large.</SPAN></P>

The charge was based on sexual intercourse with a female less than 17 years of age. Appellant contended that the statute was violative of due process and equal protection, because it did not permit ignorance or mistake as to the female's age to be asserted as a defense. Appellant further contended that the statute arbitrarily and capriciously fixed the age at which a female may consent to sexual intercourse at 17 years. The court held that strict scrutiny standard of review did not apply, because age was not a suspect classification, and that the state had a legitimate concern in protecting females 16 years and younger. In addition, the statute was malum prohibitum rather than malum in se; therefore, honest intent or no intent at all was not a factor that would invalidate the statute. Thus, the court upheld the conviction.</SPAN></P>

In an effort to invalidate that portion of the statute, petitioner decided to make himself a test case and intentionally violated its provisions by extending X-rays for certain patients beyond the permissible limitation.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The SBEA in its first action initially commenced it under &sect; 202(1)(g) which provided that the SBEA could furnish the local tax assessors with information and instruction necessary for them to perform their duties, which had to have been followed, and compliance which could have been compelled by the SBEA. The court read &sect; 202(1)(g) together with &sect; 216(2) which set forth the particular procedures the SBEA was to have followed when confronted with recalcitrant assessors. The court held that latter section provided the exclusive procedures for enforcement of SBEA rules, regulations, and orders. The next action was initiated pursuant to &sect; 216(2) to enforce an SBEA order that directed that certain exempted real properties be placed back on the tax rolls. The court held that the SBEA lacked such authority because it had procedural oversight authority only, and no right to actively participate in the local assessment process because those power were specifically reserved to the local tax assessors. Finally, the SBEA's motion for declaratory judgment could not have been treated as a summary judgment under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3211, because it was an inappropriate procedure.</SPAN></P>

In a proceeding commenced by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment (SBEA) and the State of New York after respondent assessors successfully circumvented a judgment directing them to place previously exempted properties on their town assessment rolls by first placing the omitted properties on the assessment rolls for the year 1977 and then contemporaneously removing the same properties from the 1978 rolls, in which plaintiffs moved for mandatory relief seeking an order directing that the exempt property be placed on the taxable rolls for the years&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  1977 and 1978 and that the defendant assessors be restrained from exempting these properties for the taxable year 1979, the Supreme Court reasoned that it had before it both a declaratory judgment action and a CPLR article 78 proceeding, and although it had the power to treat the motion as one for summary judgment ( CPLR 3211, subd [c]), it improperly granted declaratory relief since the court did not notify the parties of its intention to make a summary determination, thus enabling them to submit additional proof in support of their positions ( CPLR 3211, subd [c]); moreover, the relief granted in the article 78 proceeding was not procedurally appropriate since the SBEA has no powers beyond those statutorily granted (Real Property Tax Law, &sect; 216), and since the State's exclusive remedy is pursuant to article 7 of the Real Property Tax Law. Accordingly, the complaint and petition are dismissed.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner instituted a habeas corpus proceeding to prevent the revocation of his parole. He alleged the denial of his constitutional rights and denial of due process of law at the preliminary hearing due to 1) continued interrogation after he requested an attorney and informed the officers that he did not wish to speak to them; 2) the refusal of his request for a breathalyzer test for alcohol following his arrest, and; 3) the limitation of the scope of his cross-examination of a witness presented against him. The writ was denied, and petitioner appealed. On appeal, the court noted that habeas corpus is the proper remedy for review of parole revocation proceedings. The court also found that the evidence before the hearing officer was sufficient to permit a finding that petitioner had violated the terms of his conditional release by using alcohol. With respect to the cross-examination claim, the court recognized the rule that the Parole Board may limit any cross-examination to the precise factual issue of the stated violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, an adult male, was charged with the crime of consensual sodomy in violation of &sect; 130.38 after admitting to engaging, by mutual consent, in proscribed sexual conduct with another adult male in the privacy of his home. After the trial court denied defendant's motion to dismiss on the grounds that the statute was unconstitutional, defendant entered a plea of guilty. On appeal, defendant again challenged the constitutionality of the statute. The court reasoned that although curtailing conduct that offended the public was a legitimate state interest, sexual conduct engaged in by mutually consenting adults in private had little likelihood of offending a public not embarked on eavesdropping. The court ruled that because the statute's purpose would be achieved by means that were unduly broad and that invaded the area of protected freedoms, the statute impermissibly interfered with defendant's constitutional right to privacy and violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution and the due process clause of N.Y.

Law &sect; 49-b(1)(b), sought review of a decision of the Family Court, New York County (New York), which issued a support order in a child support proceeding that failed to include a payroll deduction order upon the employer of respondent husband.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The family court had concluded that issuance and enforcement of a conditional payroll deduction order under N.Y. Pers. Prop. Law &sect; 49-b(1)(b) would constitute taking of property without due process of law and would deny the father the equal protection of the law. The court modified the order with directions to enter an income deduction order. The court stated that the provision for a payroll deduction order to be included in support orders whenever the court directed payments to be made to a support collection unit was a postjudgment collection remedy, intended to enforce judicially established obligations, and did not violate due process. The court determined that because of the state's strong interest in reducing the expense and increasing the effectiveness of its child support enforcement programs, there was no denial of the equal protection of the laws with respect to the father or others similarly situated. The court determined that there was no basis for the family court's conclusion that the requirement for a mandatory conditional payroll deduction order unlawfully interfered with judicial discretion and made the courts a rubber stamp for administrative recommendations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant ex-husband sought review of the judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which denied his motion to dismiss the plaintiff ex-wife's complaint for failure to state a cause of action, pursuant to N.Y.C.P.L.R. 3211.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The ex-husband and the ex-wife were married and had three children. They later entered into a separation agreement. Subsequently, the ex-wife executed a power of attorney to enable the ex-husband to obtain a divorce in a foreign country. The divorce was obtained and the decree provided for the survival of the separation agreement. The agreement provided that the ex-husband would support the unemancipated children, but not the ex-wife. The ex-wife sought to have the separation agreement declared void and the marriage reinstated. The court reversed the judgment that denied the ex-husband's motion to dismiss the ex-wife's complaint, holding that her first cause of action that alleged fraud and misrepresentation of his financial circumstances should have been dismissed because her pleadings did not give the trial court or the ex-husband notice of what she intended to prove, pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. 3013, 3016(b). The court further held that the complaint should have been dismissed because N.Y. Gen. Oblig. Law &sect; 5-311, was unconstitutionally disparate because it improperly stated that a husband and wife could not contract to relieve the husband from liability to support the wife.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Husband and Wife -- Support</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.  Section 5-311 of the General Obligations Law is unconstitutional insofar as it denies husbands and wives the right to contract to relieve the husband of his liability to support his wife, but does not forbid them to contract to relieve the wife of her duty to support her husband unless he is or is likely to become a public charge inasmuch as the statute does not treat men and women equally and this gender-based classification serves no legitimate governmental objective; the statute should not be read expansively to extend its protection to husbands as well as wives since this&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  would mean depriving husbands of a right to contract which they previously enjoyed and, furthermore, such an extension should be done by the Legislature.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A conviction of defendant on three counts of murder in the second degree is reversed, on the law, and remanded for a new trial where the trial court's instructions to the jury, in effect, directed them to find an intent to kill because defendant's acts caused death; the court should have explained to the jury that the presumption of intent, i.e., a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his act, is permissive, not mandatory and, in any event, rebuttable.  The error cannot be deemed harmless since it absolved the People of the duty to prove an essential element of murder in the second degree, the intent to kill; moreover, having recognized the existence of a reasonable view of the evidence to justify the submission of manslaughter in the first degree as a lesser included&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  offense, the court's charge removed the lesser offense from the jury's consideration by precluding a finding that defendant acted with any intent other than to kill.</SPAN></P>

A failure by defendant to take an appropriate exception to a trial court's charge to the jury does not mean that any error therein is not preserved for appellate review where the error was of a constitutional dimension in that it involved a shifting of the People's burden of proof as to the elements of a crime inasmuch as no exception is necessary to preserve for appellate review a deprivation of a fundamental constitutional right.  </SPAN></P>

The trial court denied the father's motion and held that the derivative claim of the child's father was not tolled. The municipalities appealed from so much of the order as granted the application of the child. The court affirmed and held that N.Y. Gen.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff trade association appealed an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which denied its motion for a preliminary injunction enjoining defendant state enforcement departments, their agents and employees, pendente lite, from enforcing certain provisions of N.Y. Nav. Law art. 12 in the association's action for a declaratory judgment that art. 12 was unconstitutional, and seeking the injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trade association's members owned and operated oil storage terminals that were &quot;major facilities&quot; as defined in N.Y. Nav. Law &sect; 172(11). New York's Oil Spill Prevention and Compensation Act, 1977 N.Y. Laws 845, which enacted N.Y. Nav. Law art. 12, required each such operator to get a license and pay a license fee until the New York Environmental and Spill Compensation Fund reached $ 25 million. The fund was to be used to pay for cleanup of oil and property damage, and major facility operators were required to reimburse the fund for amounts expended as a result of their discharges. The association brought an action seeking a declaration that art. 12 violated the import-export, commerce, equal protection, and due process clauses of the United States Constitution, and for a preliminary injunction. The trial court denied the injunction. On appeal, the court affirmed, concluding that the association failed to meet its burden to show it had a clear right to ultimate victory or that art. 12 was unconstitutional, where the license fee was on the transfer of oil rather than the oil itself, and there was no factual basis for the claim that the fees were excessive.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner the Joint Bar Association Grievance Committee for the Tenth Judicial District (New York) sought confirmation of their report holding that respondent attorneys were in violation of N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner grievance committee held respondent attorneys in violation of N.Y. Jud. Law &sect; 479 and N.Y. Code of Prof'l Responsibility DR 2-103(A) for mass mailings to real estate brokers and prospective clients to establish attorney-client relationships and solicit retainers. The court confirmed the report holding that the mailings exceeded the bounds of permissible commercial speech because they constituted solicitations rather than advertising where they did not merely advise the public of the availability of legal services, but sought out particular individuals believed to be interested in a particular transaction, and urged them to retain respondents. The court held that &sect; 479 and DR 2-103(A) were constitutional insofar as the ban on solicitations by mail or in person was a &quot;reasonable restriction&quot; on the &quot;manner of advertising.&quot; The important governmental interest in prohibiting such solicitation stemmed from the potential for abuse including the possible conflict of interest in this case to the detriment of the property sellers. Because respondents' letters were apparently sent in good faith reliance on precedent, the court found disbarment, suspension, or censure unnecessary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The report of petitioner grievance committee was confirmed because respondent attorneys' mass mailings constituted solicitations in violation of professional rules rather than permissible advertising, and the rules against such solicitation were constitutional as &quot;reasonable restrictions&quot; on the &quot;manner of advertising&quot; allowed by attorneys licensed by the state.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An attorney's mailing of letters to individuals identified as prospective clients and to real estate brokers for the purpose of establishing an attorney-client relationship and soliciting a retainer in the identified transaction for the attorney's pecuniary gain exceeds the bounds of permissible commercial speech and is properly proscribed by section 479 of the Judiciary Law, which makes unlawful the soliciting either directly or indirectly of legal business, and DR 2-103 (A) of the Code of Professional Responsibility, which essentially is a duplicate of the statute, as adopted by the New York State Bar Association; section 479 of the Judiciary Law and DR 2-103 (A) of the Code of Professional&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Responsibility are constitutional insofar as they ban solicitation of legal business by mail as well as in person.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Regulation of Commercial Speech</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Although commercial speech is not wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment, it is distinguishable from other forms of speech and holds a subordinate position in the scale of First Amendment values; particularly, there is a &quot;common-sense&quot; distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation and other varieties of speech, and the State has a special interest in regulating members of a profession it licenses, and who serve as officers of its courts.  Therefore, modes of regulation that might be impermissible in the realm of noncommercial expression may be applied to forms of commercial speech, and although some forms of commercial speech regulation are surely permissible, the State may not completely prevent the dissemination, by commercial speech, of the price of professional services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Regulation of Commercial Speech</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The State may promulgate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a reasonable regulation of the manner in which commercial advertising may be distributed and, in particular, may restrict advertising that is related to activities which the State may legitimately regulate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Advertising by Attorneys</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Advertising by attorneys may not be subjected to blanket suppression because the State's interest in maintaining high standards for the professions licensed by it may not be enforced by keeping the public in ignorance of the entirely lawful terms that competing licensed professionals are offering; specifically, the State may not prevent the publication in a newspaper of an attorney's truthful advertisement concerning the availability and terms of routine legal services, but nevertheless, the State may restrict the manner of advertising professional services provided that restrictions of that kind are justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech, that they serve a significant governmental interest, and that in so doing they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Speech -- Solicitation by Attorneys</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  5. Solicitation by a lawyer of remunerative employment is a business transaction in which speech is an essential but subordinate component so that the banning thereof is subjected to a lower level of an appropriate judicial scrutiny than would be the case if it did not involve a business transaction, and the protection of the public from aspects of solicitation which involve &quot;vexatious conduct&quot;, is a legitimate and important State interest; the State has the right to take measures to regulate substantive evils, including invasion of privacy, that potentially are present in solicitation of prospective clients by lawyers.  Moreover, the State has an interest in minimizing commercialization of the legal profession and considerations of undue commercialization of the legal profession are more than of marginal force where the solicitation is for pecuniary gain; the State is free to fashion reasonable restrictions with respect to the manner of solicitation by members of its Bar, and the State may apply narrowly drawn rules to proscribe solicitation that in fact is overbearing.  </SPAN></P>

The court held that the legislature never intended that the limitation of one year and 90 days in which a court could exercise its discretion to grant late filing, based on the disability of infancy, would have been automatically extended by the disability itself. The court held that because the lower court had lacked the power to grant an extension for filing of the notice of claim beyond the period of one year and 90 days after the date of the accident on which the claim was based, the order was to be reversed and the application denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants developed a condominium project. Each was convicted in relation to criminal misconduct related to the project. Defendants contended that the evidence was insufficient to sustain their convictions had the trial court not mistakenly treated their repayment defense to larceny as an affirmative defense, that N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 79-a was unconstitutional, and that they did not have the requisite intent to sustain the perjury conviction under N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 210.35. The court disagreed on the larceny charge but agreed as to the perjury conviction. N.Y. Lien Law &sect; 79-a was determined to be constitutional, and, although the court agreed that it was an ordinary defense, defendants failed to raise the defense within the limits imposed by the legislature. As to the perjury convictions, the court determined that defendants lacked the required culpable intent required.</SPAN></P>

Moreover, defendants did not succeed in raising the defense of repayment because they did not come forward with sufficient evidence to impose the burden of disproving it on the People.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The presumption in subdivision 3 of section 79-a of the Lien Law, which provides that a trustee's failure to keep required books&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  or records shall be presumptive evidence of wrongful diversion of trust funds, furnishes reasonable protection to those entitled to payment for improvement of property for which the contractor has been paid, and it places no unreasonable burden upon the contractor; a statutory presumption of guilt arising from unexplained and willful failure to comply with the provisions of the statute rests upon a sound foundation and does not violate any provision of the Constitution of the State of New York or of the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Statutes</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> -- Presumptions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Judgments convicting defendants, a corporate builder and three corporate principals, of making apparently sworn false statements in the second degree (Penal Law, &sect; 210.35) in that one of the defendants subscribed affidavits upon which construction loan advances were made which contained a declaration that all bills due to the date of the advance were paid despite the fact that there were unpaid bills at the time the affidavits were executed, are reversed, since the requisite intent that the statement be uttered or published as true, was not established; the lending institution was aware of the existence of unpaid bills when it made advances under the construction loan agreement and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the advances were made for the purpose of enabling the sponsor to pay the accrued bills, and it was not shown that the defendants deliberately concealed the existence of unpaid contractors or that they delivered the affidavits with the intent that they be published as true.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- False Representations in Offering Statements</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The evidence was sufficient to sustain convictions of a corporate builder and two corporate principals of violating sections 352-c, 352-e and 359-g of the General Business Law insofar as an offering statement falsely represented that the defendants would hold in trust moneys received from purchasers of condominium homes and insofar as the offering statement omitted the material fact that sewer approval had been revoked; however, since the trial court found a third corporate principal not guilty insofar as the statement omitted that fact that sewer approval had been revoked on the ground that there was no evidence connecting him to the preparation, filing or amendment of the offering statement, his conviction insofar as the statement falsely represented that the defendants would hold in trust moneys received from purchasers of condominium&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  homes is reversed.  Additionally, defendants' convictions of violating sections 352-h and 359-g of the General Business Law in that they misappropriated moneys received from purchasers of condominium units were supported by the evidence.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff physician and defendants, television network, program producer, and correspondent, challenged a decision of the Supreme Court of New York , Appellate Division, which denied both parties' motions for summary judgment in the physician's libel action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The television network broadcast a program seen by millions of people that dealt with amphetamine abuse. In the program, a patient made comments that the physician prescribed certain amphetamine substitutes for her, and she alleged that taking these medications did harm to her daughter, who was born with birth defects. The physician alleged that this was defamatory, and the network argued that the statements were true. The court found that the physician was not a limited issue public figure because he did not thrust himself into the public controversy over amphetamines, especially in light of the fact that he had last treated the patient more than 10 years prior to the broadcast. Regarding the media's duty of care, the court found that the patient's statements were not confirmed for accuracy, and that the network relied on undisclosed sources for verification. Overall, the court found that a trial was required to evaluate the actions of the network in its investigative reporting that allegedly defamed the doctor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of summary judgment to all parties in the physician's libel action.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom of Press</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. While there is no privilege having a greater right to, or need for, protection, than that of freedom of the press, the judicial policy against inhibition of the vigorous and fruitful exercise of First Amendment freedoms by the media is not the equivalent of insurance against all risks.  Accordingly, since the reputation and privacy of the individual or individuals discussed is also at stake in the course of disseminating information in the public domain, &quot;hit and run&quot; journalism is no more protected under the First Amendment than speeding on a crowded sidewalk is permitted under a valid driver's license.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- Summary Judgment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. If a material, triable issue of fact exists in a libel action, summary judgment must be denied, since, although motions for summary judgment in defamation actions&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  are invaluable devices to insure the free and uninhibited debate of matters of public concern by obviating the necessity for protracted and expensive litigation where there are no factual issues, solicitude for First Amendment freedoms was not intended to abrogate the fundamental rules governing the administration of summary judgment. Accordingly, the Appellate Division affirmed Special Term's denial of cross motions for summary judgment in a libel action on the ground that issues of fact existed relative to the falsity of statements and the degree of care exercised by a television network and individual defendants in confirming their accuracy, employing a two-pronged analysis to ascertain if factual questions existed: the form, content, effect, and falsity of the allegedly defamatory statements were first examined, since the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the statements are in fact libelous, and then the First Amendment limitations on recovery were applied, since the burden of defeating constitutionally mandated privileges raised by defendants is also on the plaintiff; in making such two-pronged analysis, the following issues were considered: the libelous nature of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  statements; whether the status of plaintiff, a doctor who was the subject of a televised program on amphetamine abuse, was that of a &quot;limited issue&quot; public figure; and the telecasters' duty of care in assessing the accuracy of comments made during a taped interview, which was included in the broadcast, by a former patient of plaintiff doctor concerning the amount and nature of medication he prescribed for her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- Actionable Words -- Context</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. An allegedly libelous statement must be understood in the context in which it is heard.  Accordingly, where the whole thrust of a television report on amphetamine abuse was not only that the prescribing of amphetamines and amphetamine substitutes for obesity, which a doctor named in the broadcast allegedly did in excess, was bad medical practice, but that such practice was illegal and carried criminal sanctions that were difficult to enforce, the defamatory nature of the statements made about him was reinforced both by the context of the telecast and the setting in which the statements were made.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- Actionable Words -- Requirement of Falsity</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. There can be no recovery in a defamation&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  action unless the statements which are the subject of the action are false.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- Expression of Opinion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Opinions are constitutionally protected and may not be the subject of defamation actions, provided that the facts supporting the opinions are set forth as its bases; however, if the facts are false, or they are not stated, the opinion is actionable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- Expression of Opinion -- Context</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Whether an allegedly defamatory statement constitutes fact or opinion is a question of law, which distinction is frequently a difficult one, since what constitutes a statement of fact in one context may be treated as a statement of opinion in another, in light of the nature and content of the communication taken as a whole; opinions which label people or things generally employ terms which are loose and figurative, rather than a precise designation which is subject to rigorous examination for its truth or falsity. Accordingly, a statement by plaintiff doctor's former patient that he had prescribed &quot;amphetamine-type&quot; drugs for her is not a statement of opinion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- &quot;Limited Issue&quot; Public Figure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Whether an&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  individual is a &quot;limited issue&quot; public figure so as to give rise to protection against liability for defamatory statements concerning him is a question of law in which the nature and extent of his participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the defamation are the essential issues; in the absence of an allegation that the plaintiff in a defamation action has acted to generate the dispute, a finding that a public controversy existed at the time plaintiff acted is a prerequisite to a finding that he voluntarily acted to produce a specific outcome and, even if a continuing controversy is shown, his actions must constitute significant participation in the controversy which actions invite or attempt to attract public attention, in order to confer such status on him.  Accordingly, a doctor who may have prescribed amphetamines for a patient, whom he treated for obesity for a short time more than 10 years prior to a telecast report on amphetamine abuse, in which broadcast he was named and allegedly defamed, and who treated her at a time in which no public debate regarding the use of such drugs to combat obesity is suggested in the record, is not a &quot;limited issue&quot; public figure, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  since the nature of his actions was not then controversial and, even assuming an on-going controversy, his involvement in it was not significant; nor is the fact that he had, over a period of years, published articles in scientific books and journals, which were intended for a scholarly audience rather than a mass market, enough to make him a &quot;limited issue&quot; public figure where the articles did not involve the subject matter of the telecast or attract public attention, since it is the breadth of the audience coupled with the appeal of the topic upon which emphasis should be placed, not the extensiveness of the publishing activities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- &quot;Limited Issue&quot; Public Figure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Those charged with defamation cannot, by their own conduct, create their own defense by making the plaintiff a public figure. Accordingly, where defendant television reporter attempted to foist &quot;limited issue&quot; public figure status on plaintiff doctor by asking him for an interview in which he would comment, generally, as a practitioner in the treatment of obesity, on the abuse of amphetamines and their substitutes, but failed to confront plaintiff in any way with specific charges of such&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  abuse which had been made against him by a former patient, defendants' contention that the plaintiff should not be permitted to avoid the status of a &quot;limited issue&quot; public figure by using an &quot;ostrich&quot; approach to the controversy by refusing to be interviewed is specious.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- Public Figure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Absent clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community and pervasive involvement in the affairs of society, an individual should not be deemed a public personality for all aspects of his life; it is preferable to reduce the public figure question to a more meaningful context by looking to the nature and extent of an individual's participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the defamation. Accordingly, even where an individual consents to be interviewed by the media, the interview does not necessarily insure public figure status.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- Actionable Words</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The States are free to define their own standards of liability for the actionable defamation of a private individual by a news publisher or broadcaster.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- News Publisher or Broadcaster -- Gross Negligence Standard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Where the content&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  of a news article is arguably within the sphere of legitimate public concern, which is reasonably related to matters warranting public exposition, a private individual defamed therein may recover for such defamation if he establishes, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the publisher or broadcaster acted in a grossly irresponsible manner, without due consideration for the standards of information gathering and dissemination ordinarily followed by reasonable parties.  Accordingly, although a telecast report on the topic of amphetamine abuse is within the sphere of public concern and the personal experience of an individual who was interviewed on the program regarding such abuse is reasonably related to matters warranting public exposition, an attempt by defendant newsperson to interview plaintiff doctor, as a practitioner in the treatment of obesity, on the abuse of amphetamines and their substitutes, cannot be equated to any confrontation to determine the accuracy of charges concerning the way in which he prescribed such drugs, made against him on the program by a former patient, and is not sufficient to support a finding that defendants acted responsibly as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***11]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- Defense of Verification -- Newspersons' &quot;Shield Law&quot; Privilege</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. In a defamation action by a private individual against a newsperson, no consideration will be given, on appeal, to the defense of verification, where it is based on confidential material covered by the newspersons' privilege under the &quot;Shield Law&quot; (Civil Rights Law, &sect; 79-h), which privilege protects both the identity of the source and the information obtained, vests the media with the option to disclose or to refuse to disclose such sources and information, and does not include a divestiture procedure.  Accordingly, where defendants newspersons rely on undisclosed sources and confidential information for verification of allegedly false and defamatory telecast material and offer this verification as &quot;proof&quot; of their responsibility in gathering and disseminating the report, thus putting in issue the very privilege upon which they rely, such exploitation of the statute will not be permitted, since it vitiates the limited right to recovery that the plaintiff has as a private individual, which use is not mandated by the First Amendment, nor was it intended by the Legislature.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Slander -- Defense of Verification -- Newspersons' &quot;Shield Law&quot; Privilege</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13. Evidentiary privileges in litigation are not favored, and even those rooted in the Constitution must give way in proper circumstances.  Accordingly, at the trial of a defamation action by a private individual against newspersons, if defendants opt to rely on the newspersons' privilege of confidentiality under the &quot;Shield Law&quot; (Civil Rights Law, &sect; 79-h), they will be precluded from any use of those confidential sources and information as proof of verification of the material or evidence of responsible journalism; if they choose to fully disclose their investigation, no limitation of the defense will occur.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Libel and Slander -- News Publisher -- Gross Negligence Standard</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14. In </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Chapadeau v Utica Observer-Dispatch</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (38 NY2d 196), the Court of Appeals fashioned a gross negligence standard, defining actionable defamation of a private individual by the media, to balance the need for free debate against the right of the individual to be secure in his reputation, which, like the concept of malice, is a legal measure, designed to be applied in a wide range of circumstances and evaluated by the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***13]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  reasonable individual; these standards are not professional journalistic principles.  Accordingly, in such a defamation action, affidavits of expert journalists regarding responsible publishing standards are not required on a motion for summary judgment. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of orders of the Rockland County Court (New York), which suppressed certain evidence and dismissed the state's action against defendant on an indictment for sale of drugs. The state contended that, pursuant to recent case law, its appeal was not barred by the principles of double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Before trial, the trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence contained in tapes made by police listening to his conversations with a confidential informant. At trial, the state sought to introduce the officer's testimony regarding the conversations, but that motion was denied. The state announced it could not proceed without the evidence, and sought to hold the trial in abeyance pending an appeal of the evidentiary ruling. The trial court stated that double jeopardy had attached and dismissed the action. On appeal, the court affirmed because the trial court's termination of the proceedings favorably to defendant was made on a basis related to his guilt or innocence and thus a retrial was barred. The court found that recent case law addressing double jeopardy only dealt with circumstances where the defendant sought to have the trial terminated. Because defendant had not sought the dismissal, the state was barred from bringing the action again. The court rejected the state's contention that the trial court should have declared a mistrial, pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 280.10, because the exclusion of the officer's testimony did not occur before the trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the indictment against defendant. Because the dismissal barred further prosecution of defendant for the same offense the court dismissed the appeal of the order of suppression as academic.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A trial order of dismissal made after the jury had been impaneled and sworn, and after the prosecutor stated that the People's proof had been rendered so weak that the People could not proceed to trial since the court had denied the prosecutor's request that a certain police officer be allowed to testify as to conversations overheard by means of a transmitter, the tapes of the conversations having been suppressed, is affirmed, since although it is questionable&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  whether the dismissal of the indictment is a trial order of dismissal within the meaning of CPL 290.10 and 450.20 (subd 2), the Trial Judge's termination of the proceedings favorably to the defendant was made on a basis related to the defendant's guilt or innocence and, therefore, a retrial of the defendant is barred.</SPAN></P>

The People are precluded from taking an appeal from an adverse trial ruling whenever such appeal if resolved favorably for the People might require the defendant to stand retrial, or even if it would then be necessary for the trial court to make supplemental findings; double jeopardy principles will bar appeal unless there is available a determination of guilt which without more may be reinstated in the event of a reversal and remand.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer bought out its franchisee. The tax commission issued a notice and demand for payment of sales and use taxes due to the taxpayer pursuant to N.Y.  Tax. Law &sect; 1141(c). The court affirmed that portion of the judgment that found the taxpayer liable for the sales and use taxes not paid by the franchisee because the taxpayer had the duty to collect the taxes from the franchisee upon the buy out, and its failure to notify the tax commission of the sale 10 days prior thereto rendered the taxpayer personally liable under &sect; 1141(c). N.Y.  Tax. Law &sect; 1141(b) which authorized the tax commission to issue a warrant against the liable taxpayer did not violate procedural due process because it only effected a lien on the taxpayer's property to secure payment, and it did not cause a seizure of that property or deprive the taxpayer of its incidents of ownership. But the court did find &sect; 1141(b)&nbsp;unconstitutional because it deprived the taxpayer of its property without due process of law to the extent that there was not required a prompt post levy hearing to determine the validity of the tax commission's warrant against the taxpayer.</SPAN></P>

He filed a motion to suppress the victim's identification of him, as well as admissions he had made to the police and physical evidence obtained from him. The trial court granted the motion, and the state sought review. The court modified the suppression order. The court held that the evidence of the victim's identification of defendant was properly suppressed because the identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive. However, the court held that defendant's admissions and the physical evidence obtained from him were improperly suppressed. The court said that this later-acquired evidence was not the product of any illegal police activity that violated defendant's constitutional rights and that no deterrent purpose was to be served by suppressing it. The court concluded that because there had been no illegal police conduct, there was nothing to &quot;poison&quot; the evidence subsequently but lawfully acquired.

The construction of section 237 of the Domestic Relations Law, which provides that in actions for annulment or divorce and upon applications to modify alimony or custody, visitation or maintenance of a child, the court may direct the husband or father to pay counsel fees, as authorizing counsel fees on a gender-neutral needs-only basis in light of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Orr v Orr</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (440 U.S. 268), which invalidated an Alabama statutory scheme providing alimony for wives only as violative of the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution, shall have prospective effect only in proceedings pending on the date of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Orr</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> decision, March 5, 1979, and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  all other awards of counsel fees which had been conclusively adjudicated as of that date shall not be affected by this construction, since retroactive application prior to March 5, 1979 would produce chaotic, inequitable results.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  In a postdivorce custody proceeding commenced by the defendant husband, wherein the plaintiff wife was awarded counsel fees and disbursements, the defendant has standing to raise the issue of the constitutionality of section 237 of the Domestic Relations Law, which provides that in actions for annulment or divorce and upon applications to modify alimony or custody, visitation or maintenance of a child the court may direct the husband or father to pay counsel fees, since the Supreme Court of the United States, on a writ of certiorari to that court, ordered that the case be reconsidered in light of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Orr v Orr</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> (440 U.S. 268), which struck down as violative of the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution an Alabama statutory scheme which permitted alimony to be granted only to wives, and held that the burden borne by the plaintiff in that case, a man, which he would not bear were he female, was sufficient&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to establish standing; the gravity of the issue being beyond doubt in light of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Orr</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, the Appellate Division may reconsider the question upon remand despite the defendant's failure to request the award or raise the issue at trial.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws -- Alimony for Wives Only</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4.  A State statutory scheme which imposes alimony obligations on husbands but not wives violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; to withstand scrutiny under the equal protection clause, classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives, and a statutory scheme may not be upheld on the basis of the State's preference for an allocation of family responsibility under which the wife plays merely a submissive dependent role.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State of New York sought review of two orders of the Family Court, New York County (New York), which dismissed a charge of prostitution against respondent juvenile based upon a finding that N.Y. Penal Law &sect;&sect; 130.00 and 230.00 violated equal protection, and which dismissed a delinquency proceeding against respondent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was a juvenile who allegedly approached a man, offered to perform sexual acts in exchange for money, then took the man to a hotel room where he was beaten and robbed. The State charged respondent with robbery, assault, and prostitution in violation of N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 230.00. At the trial on the prostitution charge, respondent filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted. Subsequently, the trial court also dismissed the delinquency proceeding on the robbery charge, finding respondent had been denied her right to a speedy trial because more than two years had passed since respondent's arrest. On appeal, the court reviewed the record and concluded that &sect; 230.00 was not an invasion of any constitutionally protected right of privacy because there was no familial or quasi-familial interest to be protected. The court also found that respondent's claim that the prostitution statute violated the equal protection clause in that it was discriminatorily enforced on the basis of sex was without warrant in law and was not properly challenged without an evidentiary hearing. The court further held that there had been no unnecessary period of delay under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 30.30.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the orders of the family court and remanded the case for further proceedings. The court held that respondent was not denied her right to a speedy trial, and that the family court improperly declared the penal statute unconstitutional since the family court failed to conduct an evidentiary hearing to establish that the statute criminalizing prostitution was discriminatorily enforced.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Family Court -- Juvenile Delinquents</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The exclusive original jurisdiction conferred upon the Family Court over persons alleged to be juvenile delinquents (Family Ct Act, &sect; 713) is controlled by the age of the respondent at the time the delinquent act allegedly was done (Family Ct Act, &sect; 714, subd [a]) and not by the age of the respondent at the time of the hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Academic and Moot Questions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In a case which raises matters of constitutional dimension and grave public interest, important in the context of juvenile justice and bearing upon the operation of the criminal justice system, which matters are apt to recur, albeit in fact patterns that may vary in degree, an appellate court may properly decline to dismiss an appeal as moot and, instead, resolve&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the merits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Juvenile Delinquents -- Right to Speedy Trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. While the right to a speedy and public trial, as defined by the Federal Constitution (US Const, 6th, 14th Amdts) and by State statutes (Civil Rights Law, &sect; 12; CPL 30.20), speaks only of criminal proceedings, it would take a distorted view to believe that adult felony criminal proceedings were designed to be more tender of the rights of detained adults than the Family Court proceedings are of juveniles; indeed, so important does this State consider the right, that it has encompassed it within a specific time frame.  ( CPL 30.30.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Speedy Trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In determining whether the constitutional right to a speedy trial has been infringed, there must be a balancing of factors including the extent of delay, the reason for the delay, the nature of the underlying charge, whether or not there has been an extended period of pretrial incarceration, and whether or not there is any indication that the defense has been impaired by reason of the delay; mere passage of time is not, in and of itself, sufficient to trigger the constitutional right to dismissal upon the ground that a speedy trial&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  has been denied.  Accordingly, in the absence of a hearing demonstrating consideration and balancing of these factors, there is no basis for holding that a defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial has been infringed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Right to Speedy Trial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. The time period after which a person charged becomes entitled to a dismissal for failure to accord her a speedy trial excludes a reasonable period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant, including but not limited to pretrial motions and the period during which such matters are under consideration by the court ( CPL 30.30, subd 4, par [a]).  Accordingly, dismissal of a juvenile delinquency proceeding on the ground that respondent has been deprived of a speedy trial is improper where, when the period between the time respondent's Law Guardian moved to dismiss a charge of prostitution and the time it was finally submitted and decided is excluded, the period of delay does not exceed the time limitations of CPL 30.30, since it is, therefore, plain that there was no infringement of respondent's statutory right to a speedy trial, even though, at the time her fact-finding hearing was held in&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Family Court, the juvenile delinquency charges against her had been pending for more than 10 months.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Appeal -- Matters Reviewable</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Although section 1112 of the Family Court Act provides that appeal may be taken as of right in juvenile delinquency proceedings only from an order of disposition and in the discretion of the appropriate Appellate Division from any other order in such proceedings, section 1118 of the Family Court Act makes the provisions of the CPLR, where appropriate, applicable to appeals from the Family Court.  Accordingly, while an order of the Family Court, dismissing a charge of sexual misconduct against respondent prior to the final judgment dismissing the juvenile delinquency proceeding against her, is not a final order of disposition and could not be the subject of an appeal as of right, it is, nonetheless, reviewable as an intermediate order, upon an appeal from the final order, since under CPLR 5501 (subd [a], par 1), an appeal from a final judgment brings up for review any nonfinal order which necessarily effects the final judgment, provided that such nonfinal order has not previously been reviewed by the court to which the appeal is taken.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Reaching Issue of Constitutionality</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Constitutional questions should not be reached unless there is a need for their determination to resolve the issue at hand and the question is squarely presented.  Accordingly, upon an allegation that respondent offered to perform a deviate sexual act for United States currency, which allegation merely particularizes the sexual conduct in which respondent offered to engage so as to bring the charge within the ambit of the definition of prostitution, the Family Court erred in reaching out to consider the constitutionality of statutes defining deviate sexual intercourse (Penal Law, &sect; 130.00, subd 2) and consensual sodomy (Penal Law, &sect; 130.38); no need for resolution of these issues existed, nor was the issue presented, since, were respondent to be found guilty of the sexual misconduct with which she is charged, the finding could only be that she had performed acts which, if committed by an adult, would constitute prostitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Right of Privacy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. The right of privacy encompasses and protects the personal intimacies of the home, the family, marriage, motherhood, procreation and child&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  rearing; such right is limited to those acts deemed fundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, and does not exempt from State regulation those matters in which government has a legitimate interest.  Clearly, the alleged right to use the public streets to solicit, agree or offer to engage in sexual conduct with another person for a fee is hardly one to be deemed fundamental or implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, and the important State interest in proscribing such conduct is emphasized where the offeror is a 14-year-old child; accordingly, section 230.00 of the Penal Law, the statute criminalizing prostitution, is not an invasion of any constitutionally protected right of privacy, since there is no familial or quasi-familial interest to be protected and the act is, therefore, well within the reach of the police power of the State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The claim of unequal protection is treated not as an affirmative defense to criminal prosecution or the imposition of a regulatory sanction, but as a motion to dismiss or quash the official action and, thus, an evidentiary hearing is required so that the court may determine&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the constitutional issue.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Equal Protection of Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. To sustain a claim of unequal protection with respect to a criminal statute, a showing is required that the law, fair on its face, is enforced consciously and deliberately against some and that, with knowledge that a crime has been committed by others, there is an intentional and premeditated abstention from enforcing it against others, which selective application is deliberately based upon an impermissible standard such as race, religion or some other arbitrary classification; the conscious exercise of some selectivity in enforcement of the law is not, in itself, a constitutional violation.  Accordingly, although classification based upon sex is clearly suspect under the equal protection clause, where the preliminary step necessary to the establishment of selective application on that basis -- an evidentiary hearing -- is not conducted and respondent fails to show selective application, which is not demonstrated by a discrepancy between the number of females prosecuted for prostitution and the number of males prosecuted for patronizing a prostitute, as they are discrete crimes necessitating separate&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  acts to effect their commission, a holding that section 230.00 of the Penal Law, the prostitution statute, was discriminatorily enforced is, under the circumstances, without warrant in law.  </SPAN></P>

Educ. Law &sect; 6509(7), (9). The education commissioner suspended the optometrist's license for two years, and he petitioned for review. The court annulled the two-year suspension and imposed an 18-month stayed suspension because the record did not disclose any reason to believe that the employee was exceeding his training or field of specialty in view of his ability to act under the supervision of a physician. Further, there was no showing that the misconduct was harmful to the public. Since the error was at most a technical violation of the Education Law, the punishment should not have been more than technical.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant juveniles sought review of the orders of the Family Court, Kings County (New York). The orders were based on findings that the juveniles had committed acts, which, if committed by an adult, would have constituted the crimes of robbery in the first degree, a &quot;designated felony act&quot; under N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect; 712(h), and burglary in the second degree. The trial court ordered that they be placed restrictively with the youth division.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">There were two issues in the action: whether the age of the victim was proven to be 62 years or older; and whether the provisions of N.Y. Fam. Ct. Act &sect;&sect; 712(h) para. ii, 753-a(2-a) et seq., requiring &quot;restrictive placement&quot; of a youth 14 or 15 years of age for committing a &quot;designated felony act&quot; of robbery in the first degree, violated the juveniles' constitutional rights. The juveniles were placed in mandatory restrictive placement because they had inflicted serious physical injury upon the victim, who was over 62 years of age. The trial court was justified in concluding that the assistant director had authority to certify the hospital record and that the entry in the record, that complainant was 73, was admissible. The Legislature determined that youths who perpetrated acts of robbery and assault upon elderly persons had to reside in a residential and secure facility for a period of time, both to protect society and to enable the division for youth to provide intensive and concentrated rehabilitative services in a controlled setting. That was not violative of the juveniles' right to procedural due process. There was a rational basis justifying the restrictive placement.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. There was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the age of a robbery victim was 62 years of age or more where the Family Court based its conclusion on a statement that she was 73 years of age contained in the hospital record of her medical treatment resulting from the attack, which record was admitted into evidence (CPLR 4518, subd [c]), and the Trial Judge's statement at the dispositional hearing that based on his personal observation of the victim's appearance at the fact-finding hearing, she was over 62 years of age; it was&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  proper to admit the hospital record into evidence without a notarized signature of the assistant director of the hospital who certified it since CPLR 4518 (subd [c]) contains no requirement that the signature of the authenticator be notarized, nor need a witness be called to testify that the record was kept in the ordinary course of business as the purpose of CPLR 4518 (subd [c]) is to allow the admission into evidence of municipal hospital records or copies thereof without calling such a witness (CPLR 2306, 2307), and the Family Court was justified in concluding that the assistant director of the hospital had authority to certify the hospital record (CPLR 4518, subd [c]; 2306, subd [a]); the entry in the hospital record that the victim was 73 years of age was properly admitted in evidence inasmuch as a patient's history, necessary or helpful to the observation, diagnosis and treatment of the patient, is ordinarily admissible as part of the hospital record and, in view of the injuries inflicted upon the victim during the robbery, knowledge of her age was a relevant factor in the diagnosis and treatment by the hospital's medical staff.</SPAN></P>

Subdivision 2-a of section 753-a of the Family Court Act, which requires restrictive placement of a youth 14 or 15 years of age for committing a designated felony act involving the infliction of serious physical injury upon a person who is 62 years of age or more, does not eliminate the need for a dispositional hearing nor render it a nullity (Family Ct Act, &sect; 753-a, subd 1) so as to deny a youth his right to procedural due process of law; moreover, although subdivision 2-a mandates restrictive placement, if the Family Court determines prior to the entry of its dispositional order that a juvenile does not require supervision, treatment or confinement, it may then grant a new fact-finding hearing (Family Ct Act, &sect; 761) and dismiss the petition if it believes the allegations contained therein are not established.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree.

The extent of her involvement, other than the aforesaid, was not delineated with any further degree of specificity, but she had no prior record. She was shown to have a low level of intelligence. The trial court held that the law was mandatory that her sentence was a minimum of six years and a maximum of her natural life. Modifying the order sentencing defendant, the court held that defendant's case presented that rare case which on its particular facts compelled the reasoned conclusion that the statutes had been unconstitutionally applied insofar as the sentencing of this defendant was concerned.

The court modified the order by deleting the paragraph which stated that those sections were unconstitutional and substituting a paragraph declaring that they were, and as modified affirmed. The court held that while the legislature could not pass on its law-making functions to other bodies, there was no constitutional prohibition against the delegation of power, with reasonable safeguards and standards, to an agency or commission to administer the law as enacted by the legislature.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The victim was shot and killed while waiting for the subway. Defendant made statements to police that implicated his involvement in the murder. At the hearing on defendant's motion to suppress, numerous print and television reporters crowded the courtroom. While the trial judge originally denied defendant's motion for closure, he later granted the motion, noting the extensive treatment of the story in the media. In denying the government's application, the court found that the trial judge properly exercised his discretion in granting the motion for two reasons. First, closure was necessary to prevent disclosure of defendant's statements to potential jurors. Second, closure obviated the necessity for a retrial, which likely would have been mandated because of the adverse effects of publicity. The court also noted that the case had attracted widespread publicity because defendant was the first 13-year-old to be prosecuted as an adult under recently enacted amendments to the New York Juvenile Law.</SPAN></P>

The Commission denied the application. The corporation initiated a refund action. In affirming the Commission's decision, the court found that since the corporation did not pay a sales tax upon the purchase of the planes, the use tax was properly imposed by statute. The planes were used solely for the corporation's benefit and were subject to its direction in the state, so there was taxable event. The statute did not violate the Commerce Clause or the Equal Protection Clause because the planes were not engaged in interstate commerce at the taxable moments and there was no unequalization of class that would void the tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, a city and a police department, appealed a decision from the Supreme Court in Broome County (New York) declaring 1977 N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The disabled firemen were receiving benefits under &sect; 207-a. The benefits included their full regular salaries and free medical care until their disabilities ceased. The legislature then enacted 1977 N.Y. Laws ch. 965, which gave disabled firemen their full salaries until they reached their mandatory retirement age and then they would receive reduced retirement benefits. The firemen initiated an action against defendants alleging that ch. 965 was unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment for the firemen, finding that ch. 965 improperly abrogated the disable fireman's rights to receive benefits and enjoined defendants from reducing the benefits. In modifying the decision, the court reversed the finding of unconstitutionality and declared the statute constitutional. The court found that ch. 965 was intended as a remedial statute to alleviate the excessive costs of N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 207-a. It therefore could be given retrospective application and did not impair vested rights. The court concluded that the terms and conditions of the disabled firemen's employment were at issue, rather than their retirement or pension benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The society challenged the landmark designation applied by the commission to one of its buildings. The trial court annulled the designation on the basis that the restrictions flowing from the landmark designation interfered with the religious, educational, and charitable purposes of the society. The commission appealed and the court reversed. The court observed that landmark regulation inevitably had a restricting or adverse effect on property, charitable or otherwise. The court also observed that, although religious structures enjoyed a constitutionally protected status that curtailed the permissible extent of governmental regulation, the power of regulation was not eliminated. The court found that the landmark designation did not interfere with the society's use of the building or with the society's charitable or religious activities. The court noted that the landmark designation did pose the possibility of future restrictions regarding any alteration or demolition of the building but that any future &quot;hardship&quot; was speculative and would have to be judged on the basis of the society's needs at that time.</SPAN></P>

Although the society's claim of hardship is not premature to the extent that the designation impairs the value of the property, the designation does not constitute an undue interference with the free exercise of religion in violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution since a large part of the contemplated use is wholly unrelated to the exercise of religion, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  except for the tangential benefit of raising revenue through development.  </SPAN></P>

The Commission sustained the assessment. The taxpayer appealed, and the lower court transferred the proceeding to the court. The court sustained the assessment, holding that the assessment was not time barred under N.Y.

The Commission was justified in concluding that the hot dog casings did not constitute cartons for the purpose of the exemptions in N.Y. Tax Law &sect;&sect; 1115(a)(19), 1118(4). The Commission correctly determined that there was a taxable event in the state because the delivery truck was used solely for the taxpayer's benefit and was subject to its direction and control, and it travelled at least 300 miles per week on New York State roads.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Subdivision 4-a of section 510 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which provides that the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles may suspend the driver's license of a person who has failed to appear within three months of the return date or new subsequent adjourned date pursuant to an appearance ticket, pending receipt of notice that the person has appeared and that the suspension shall take effect no less than 30 days from the day upon which notice thereof is sent to the person, is not unconstitutionally vague as to a definite date for suspension or as to proper notice, since it expressly provides that there must be a minimum period of 30 days from the date of the notice of suspension, is expressly limited to last no longer than the failure of a licensee to appear after such notice is given, and expressly requires that notice to the licensee be given; additionally, the form used by the Department of Motor Vehicles to notify licensees of suspension is not a rule which must be filed with the Secretray of State since the statute expressly&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  requires that notice be given to motorists and the form is nothing more or less than the transmittal of notice, and is not unconstitutionally vague in that it provides that it will become effective 30 days from the date of the notice unless there is notification from the court that the summons has been answered or indication that other action is necessary, since the Department of Motor Vehicles is empowered to reserve the right to take whatever action it might be authorized to take upon a review of the licensee's record.</SPAN></P>

Where a driver's license is suspended pursuant to subdivision 4-a of section 510 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, the lack of a presuspension hearing does not violate the licensee's due process rights, since the State's interest is in keeping reckless drivers off the road and under such circumstances, the available review pursuant to CPLR article 78 is sufficient protection.  </SPAN></P>

He was ordered to report back to work but he refused to comply, claiming that he was still physically unfit for duty.

The employee contended that he had been denied due process in that he had not been afforded a hearing prior to his dismissal and, that he was entitled to unlimited sick leave under a collective bargaining agreement. The trial court ruled that the employee had been improperly dismissed. On appeal, the court reversed the decision because the employer was not required to provide a judgmental ruling in absence of any claim by the employee that he was not in fact incapacitated. The court determined that the employer's resolution was purely an administrative determination and was neither a judicial nor quasi-judicial decision requiring due process. The court also rejected the employee's claim that he was entitled to unlimited sick leave because the collective bargaining agreement was in direct conflict with public policy.</SPAN></P>

Therefore although the action was filed five years and five months after the crime, it was filed only one month after payment was made to the convict for his rights to the movie into an escrow account, the action filed by the victim was timely as to funds in the account.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The instant suit involved plaintiff's existing sign that had a permit for many years. Plaintiff citizen sued the City, claiming that the City's sign ordinance was an unreasonable exercise of the police power and served to confiscate its property without just compensation, in violation of constitutional strictures. In addition, plaintiff claimed that the establishment of a Civic Art Commission was an unconstitutional delegation of powers. The City filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, but the supreme court denied it. On appeal, the court modified, by adding an exception to plaintiff's fifth cause of action, and as so modified, affirmed. The court found that plaintiff's fifth cause of action asserted in the complaint had been raised prematurely. Plaintiff had not been called upon to submit an application for a permit to the Civic Art Commission, which was established pursuant to the sign ordinance in question. Because the amortization period of three years provided for in the ordinance could not be extended, the court found that plaintiff was entitled to an immediate hearing as to whether the amortization period provided in the ordinance was unreasonable as applied.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed. It found that under the federal regulation, 20 C.F.R. &sect; 416.110(c), payments were made under conditions as protective of people's dignity as possible and no restrictions, implied or otherwise, were placed on how recipients spent the federal payments. It also found no federal enabling statute authorizing the state to allocate the funds was required.

A referee was directed to hear and report on the disallowed claims and appellants challenged the decision.

The court further held that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Constitution did not preclude the states from prescribing relevant qualifications for their jurors.

On appeal by the state, the court reversed the dismissal, reinstated the charge, and ordered a new trial. The court held that the trial court was permitted to dismiss the charge only if it found that the state did not prove its case, but it could not decide to save the state the expense of a new trial. Further, the court held that the trial court should have declared a mistrial rather than dismissing the charge. Finally, the court determined that reinstatement and retrial would not have violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because there was no acquittal or a termination based on a the state's legally insufficient case.</SPAN></P>

In addition they sought counsel fees under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988. The trial court granted their requested relief but denied their request for counsel fees.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an employable home relief recipient, challenged the judgment of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which, in a proceeding pursuant to N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A son applied for medical benefits on behalf of his elderly father. The local social services agency denied the application, and the state department of social services affirmed the denial. The application was denied because the state believed that the applicant's father transferred assets when he had a medical need in order to qualify for medical assistance. The applicant sought judicial review. On review, the court found sufficient proof to substantiate that the applicant's father did transfer assets in order to qualify for medical assistance. The court also considered but rejected the applicant's claim that the applicable statute.&nbsp;N.Y. Soc. Serv. Law &sect; 366 (1)(e) violated the Supremacy Clause and was unconstitutional. The court found that &sect; 366 (1)(e) did not conflict with federal statutes and regulations.

There is no violation of Federal law, since although Federal rules provide that only those resources actually available to an applicant are to be considered in determining eligibility, and State transfer-of-assets statutes which assume assets are available to recipients when in fact such assets are not available are unconstitutional, the New York statute denies assistance only where the transfer is made for the purpose of qualifying for medical assistance, i.e., a sham or spurious transfer or one made with fraudulent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  intent, unlike statutes of other States which have been held invalid since they disqualified an applicant solely because of a transfer.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff consumer sought damages in negligence and strict products liability against defendants, a manufacturer, seller, and servicer. The consumer alleged that the bolts on his used crane suddenly fractured heavily damaging the crane alone. The manufacturer, seller, and servicer appealed an order from the Supreme Court of Onondaga County (New York), which denied their motions for summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the manufacturer and seller owed a duty to the consumer under the doctrine of strict products liability not to place into the stream of commerce a crane containing defective bolts the failure of which would create a danger of physical injury resulting to consumer's property extrinsic to the crane or to the crane itself. The damages were not in the loss of the benefit of the consumer's bargain but in the damages to the crane proximately caused by the defective bolts. Cases relied upon by the manufacturer, seller, and servicer were inapplicable because they did not involve physical damages resulting from a dangerous defect in a product. The disclaimer of warranty and &quot;as is&quot; clauses in the purchase contract did not benefit the manufacturer, seller, and servicer because it was conceded that there was no privity with the manufacturer or the servicer. Moreover, there was no showing that these clauses were intended to exclude a claim of physical damage to the product under the strict products liability theory. Therefore, summary judgment was properly denied.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While on parole for another crime, defendant was arrested for possession of heroin. However, the charge was dismissed because the heroin had been illegally seized. Subsequently, defendant's parole was revoked based in part on his admission to his parole officer that he had been in possession of heroin at the time of his arrest. Defendant argued that his statement to his parole officer was erroneously admitted at the hearing because the heroin had been illegally seized. The court held that the statement was sufficiently distinguishable from the illegal seizure and, as such, was admissible in the parole revocation hearing under the doctrine of attenuation. Additionally, the court reasoned that because the parole revocation hearing was not considered a criminal proceeding, the exclusionary standards applicable in a criminal trial did not apply to defendant's case at issue.</SPAN></P>

He appealed his convictions. On appeal, the court considered defendant's claim that the lower court committed reversible error in refusing to instruct the jury that in order to convict the defendant of attempted murder as charged in the indictment, the People had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew or had reason to know that his intended victim was a peace officer at the time that he attempted to kill him, as provided by N.Y. Penal Law &sect;125.27 (1)(a)(i). The court noted that defense counsel preserved the issue for review. The court examined N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 110.05, which provided in part that an attempt to commit a crime was a Class A-I felony when the crime attempted was the felony of murder of a peace officer in the course of performing his official duties. The court concluded that the deterrent purpose of the law would not be served by construing it as a strict liability statute.

The nonjudicial employees sought a judgment declaring that they had incurred a termination of service under certain county ordinances and collective bargaining agreements and were entitled to cash payment for accumulated time off that had not transferred. The lower court granted the nonjudicial employees' motion for summary judgment and held that the only issue to be determined was the amount of individual damages. The county appealed, and the court reversed the lower court's judgment, denied the motion for summary judgment, dismissed the complaint, and granted judgment in favor of the county. The court held that the annual transfer of boiler plate languages in various ordinances did not serendipitously furnish to the nonjudicial employees a legally viable claim to a windfall of entitlement to terminal benefits. No one could rationally have assumed that there was any circumstance that would trigger terminal leave payments, in which an employee could continue his services exactly as before and still claim that he was terminated for the purpose of collecting such payments.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment in favor of the mother, but denied the mother's request for damages and an attorney's fee. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the mother's request for an attorney's fee. The court held that, although 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1988 allowed an award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party in a civil rights action, such an award was not appropriate in every case. The court held that the mother's action was merely an ordinary administrative proceeding under N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner investigated the city's water supply and determined that an outbreak of parasitic disease arose from the water supply. The commissioner held a full evidentiary hearing. He then ordered the city to submit plans for the construction of a complete water treatment facility pursuant to N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 1107. The city requested review of the determination. The court confirmed the determination and dismissed the city's petition. First, the court held that because the hearing held by the commissioner was not statutorily mandated, the court reviewed the determination under the arbitrary and capricious standard, rather than the substantial evidence test. While there was ample justification for a full evidentiary hearing, the fact that the hearing was held did not bring about the application of a different standard of review. The court further held that the commissioner clearly had a rational basis for his determination.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Applicable Test for Review of Administrative Order</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The substantial evidence test is to be applied for the review of an administrative order where a hearing has been held and evidence taken &quot;pursuant to direction by law&quot; ( CPLR 7803, subd 4); however, where a full evidentiary hearing is conducted, but not mandated, the proper test is whether there is a rational basis for the order, i.e., the courts cannot interfere unless the action complained of is arbitrary and capricious. Accordingly, the rational basis test is the one applicable for review of an order issued by the Commissioner of Health pursuant to section 1107 of the Public Health Law, as despite the fact that the order is based upon facts adduced at a hearing, such hearing was not required by section 1107.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Proceeding against Body or Officer -- Scope of Review</SPAN></P>

A determination by the Commissioner of Health, pursuant to section 1107 of the Public Health Law, ordering a city to submit plans for the construction of a complete water treatment facility has a rational basis where there is evidence that the water supply is unsafe and will continue to be so absent implementation of the measures ordered; the fact that implementation will obligate the city to expend large amounts of money does not necessitate a finding that the determination is not a reasonable improvement within the meaning of section 1107.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Health -- Unsafe Public Water Supplies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The conditions which could cause a municipal water supply to become a certifiable health hazard are infinite, requiring that the Commissioner of Health be given the widest flexibility, and although the powers conferred on the Commissioner by the Legislature pursuant to section 1107 of the Public Health Law are not precisely defined, drinking water standards promulgated by the Commissioner (10 NYCRR Part 72) provide a sufficient basis upon which to make&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a certification that a water supply is dangerous to the public health; accordingly, a determination by the Commissioner ordering a city to submit plans for the construction of a complete water treatment facility is both reasonable and lawful where there is evidence that the water supply is unsafe and will continue to be so absent implementation of the measures ordered.</SPAN></P>

Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 10, &sect; 800.22 9(d) specifically prohibited an invalid coach service from providing emergency care in transit or emergency medical service. Emergency medical service was defined as providing initial emergency medical assistance including, but not limited to, the treatment of trauma, burns, respiratory, circulatory, and obstetrical emergencies. In contrast, an &quot;ambulance service&quot; was permitted to transport &quot;sick, disabled or injured persons.&quot;</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. 78 in the Supreme Court-Special Term, Albany County (New York), which was transferred to the court. The company sought review of a decision made by respondent State Tax Commission, denying the company's application for a re-determination of a tax imposed under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 181. The trial court affirmed the Commission's determination, and the company sought review.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company issued 300 million shares of capital stock without par value but with a stated value, which were to replace the company's then authorized 150 million shares of par value capital stock. As a result, the Corporation Tax Bureau of the State Tax Commission claimed an additional license fee under N.Y. Tax Law &sect; 181. Thereafter, the Bureau changed the company's license fee allocation percentage. Following a formal hearing, the Commission concluded that the change from par value to no par value stock was a change in capital structure within the meaning and intent of &sect; 181. It further held that the license fee was properly recomputed. The court held that: (1) the company was given credit for the fees it had previously paid so the company had not been taxed twice; (2) &sect; 181 did not violate the Equal Protection Clauses of the state and federal constitutions because there were material differences between the two kinds of stock so classifying them separately for taxation purposes was justified; and (3) it was not unconstitutional for New York to tax the no par value stock of a foreign corporation at a higher rate than similar shares of domestic corporations.</SPAN></P>

Furthermore, all money received for par value stock except amounts in excess of par value must be made part of petitioner's stated capital and must be maintained.  However, under the laws of Pennsylvania, petitioner's directors may allocate a portion of the consideration received for no par value stock to capital surplus which may be entirely depleted without affecting future earnings; therefore, the utilization of no par value stock provides&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  directors with greater authority and flexibility to manipulate available surplus to provide for greater dividends and redemption of issue stock.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed his conviction. U.S. Const. amend. V was not a barrier to admission of defendant's refusal. The privilege against self-incrimination did not attach because defendant possessed no constitutional right to deny plaintiff physical evidence. Plaintiff had a right to obtain the chemical test.

Section 1194 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, which permits the admission at trial of testimony of a defendant's refusal to submit to a breathalyzer test for intoxication, is not unconstitutional as violative of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination since the State has a clear right to obtain the test results; no religious scruple or claim of pain or danger can seriously be alleged as a reason to refuse a breathalyzer test; the admission of defendant's refusal is not a penalty for his exercise of a constitutional right, for he has no constitutional right to refuse to take the test; conduct of an accused indicative of a guilty mind is admissible against him on the theory that an inference of guilt may be drawn from consciousness of guilt and the admission of refusal evidence is in accordance with the current national trend.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which affirmed defendant's conviction for the criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second degree and received a sentence of imprisonment for six years to life.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A confidential informant arranged to have a police officer purchase cocaine from an alleged drug dealer, but the dealer failed to appear at the informant's apartment. The informant and officer then met defendant, the dealer's girlfriend, by chance on the street. Defendant arranged a meeting with the dealer for them at her apartment, where defendant handed the officer a bag of cocaine. Defendant was convicted of criminal sale of cocaine. On appeal, the court found that defendant was deprived of a fair trial because the prosecution failed to make a diligent effort to produce the informant as a witness at trial. The court noted that the trial court had modified its prior order by eliminating pretrial disclosure upon the prosecution's express representation that the informant would be produced at trial. The court also found there was no reason for the prosecution to equate defendant with a street junkie when the record did not demonstrate that she was a junkie, and that there was a misstatement of the law when the trial court, at the conclusion of its charge to jury, declared that defendant had to prove her affirmative defenses of duress and entrapment beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>

A spectre of bad faith was raised entitling the defendant to a new trial when the People failed to make a diligent effort to produce an informant, who was under the employ or control of law enforcement officials and whose whereabouts were known but who was unwilling to testify as a witness at defendant's trial, since the People had the duty to make the informant, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  whose testimony was relevant to the guilt or innocence of the accused, available to the defense for examination at trial in order to protect defendant's right of confrontation, due process and fairness, and the trial court, which originally ordered the People to produce the informant at both pretrial disclosure and at trial, relied upon the People's express representation on reargument of the motion by the People after the jury was selected, that the informant would be produced at trial and called to testify, in subsequently ordering that the People only need to produce the informant at the trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, county and the Attorney General of the State of New York, sought review of a judgment by the Supreme Court, Monroe County (New York), which granted summary judgment in favor of respondents, an out-of-state construction company and workers, and adjudged N.Y.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After beginning work on a construction project in Monroe County, New York, respondents were forced by appellants to comply with N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 222, which required that preference in employment on the project be given to New York state residents. The trial court declared the law unconstitutional and enjoined appellants from enforcing it. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision. The court held that the individual employees had standing to challenge the statute because their injuries were likely to be redressed by a favorable decision. The court ruled that respondents did not waive their right to challenge the validity of the statute by failing to object to its preference requirement until after the start of construction or by making substantial efforts to comply with it. The court held that the statute violated the commerce and privileges and immunities clauses of the United States Constitution. The statute's purpose, to alleviate unemployment in New York, did not bear a substantial relationship to the particular evil it was aimed at.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Individual employees have standing to challenge section 222 of the Labor Law, which provides that with respect to the construction of public works, preference in employment shall be given to New York State citizens, because their injuries are likely to be redressed by a favorable decision; an employee has standing to challenge the unconstitutional interference of third persons with the employer-employee relationship.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While a party may waive constitutional rights where they are exclusively private and no consideration of public morals or policy is involved, acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights is not presumed; a corporation's acceptance of a public works construction contract should not be conditioned upon a waiver of constitutional rights, and its attempts to comply with section 222 of the Labor Law, which provides that, with respect to the construction of public works, preference in employment be given to New York State citizens, in order to avoid breaching the construction contract is not a waiver of the right to challenge the statute's constitutionality.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Freedom to Travel between States -- Employment Purposes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A resident of one State is constitutionally entitled to travel to another State for purposes of employment free from discriminatory restrictions in favor of State residents imposed by the other State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Discrimination against Noncitizens</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A State may not discriminate against citizens of other States in situations where there is no valid, substantial reason for such discrimination; &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  in order for a discriminatory statute to be valid, the noncitizens must constitute a peculiar source of the evil which the statute seeks to remedy and there must be a reasonable relationship between the evil and the discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor -- Preference in Employment -- Violation of Privileges and Immunities Clause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Inasmuch as the purpose of section 222 of the Labor Law, which provides that with respect to the construction of public works, preference in employment shall be given to New York State citizens, is to alleviate unemployment in New York, and the statute grants an across-the-board preference to all New York residents, it does not bear a substantial relationship to the particular evil aimed at and violates the privileges and immunities clause of the United States Constitution (art IV, &sect; 2), since in order for a State to discriminate against citizens of another State, the noncitizens must constitute a peculiar source of the evil which the statute seeks to remedy and there must be a reasonable relationship between the evil and the discrimination.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor -- Preference in Employment -- Violation of Privileges and Immunities Clause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Where a contract for&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  construction of a county sanitary sewer line was awarded to an out-of-State corporation, and out-of-State residents who were permanent employees of the corporation, in addition to newly hired New York State residents, came to the county to work on the project, in violation of section 222 of the Labor Law, which grants a job preference to New York residents with respect to the construction of public works, the project does not fall within the &quot;State ownership&quot; exception to the privileges and immunities clause of the Federal Constitution (art IV, &sect; 2), which allows a State to discriminate against noncitizens with respect to resources owned by the State, since the exception is not absolute in that it applies only where the resource is owned wholly by the State, the exception is inapplicable to basic and essential activities, interference with which would frustrate the purposes of the formation of the Union, the sewer line construction project is not the type of State resource within the exception, and the presence of Federal funding casts doubt upon the project's status as State owned.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Commerce -- States' Right to Regulate</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. In the absence of Federal legislation, commerce&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is open to control by the States so long as they act within the restraints imposed by the commerce clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor -- Preference in Employment -- Commerce Clause</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Inasmuch as the effect of section 222 of the Labor Law, which provides that with respect to the construction of public works, preference in employment is to be given to New York State citizens, is to protect New York residents from the competition of out-of-State labor and results in improper economic protectionism, the statute violates the commerce clause (US Const, art I, &sect; 8) since the purpose of the clause is to prevent the States from becoming isolated economic units.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Labor -- Preference in Employment -- Equal Protection</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. It has been held that section 222 of the Labor Law, which provides that with respect to the construction of public works, preference in employment is to be given to New York State residents, violates the equal protection clause (US Const, 14th Amdt, &sect; 1) insofar as it discriminates against resident aliens.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff, a regional off-track betting corporation, appealed an order of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which granted the motion to dismiss of defendant, the director of the state employees' retirement system, on the ground that the corporation lacked standing to maintain an action contending that 1976 N.Y. Laws 890 and a directive promulgated thereunder were inapplicable.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state employees' retirement system was amended by 1976 N.Y. Laws 890 to provide that all full-time employees hired thereafter would be members of the system. The director contended that all full-time employees were required by the amendment to become members of the system and contribute accordingly, and so directed the corporation. The corporation argued that the amendment's terms were unconstitutionally vague, particularly with respect to the definition of full-time employees, and that the directive was improperly promulgated. The trial court ruled that because the corporation was created by the legislature, it lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of acts of the legislature. The court reversed that ruling because one subdivision of the state could challenge another's statutory interpretation. Proceeding to the merits, the court held that the amendment did not significantly expand the corporation's pension obligations and that there was no difficulty in differentiating between part-time and full-time employees because N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 513(a)(1) provided a clear definition. The director was, therefore, entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court modified the order by reversing so much of it as dismissed the corporation's claims, reinstated those claims, and directed that judgment be entered in the director's favor declaring that the act and directive were applicable to the corporation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, city and its corporation counsel, appealed an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term in Erie County (New York), which adjudged that a city ordinance was unconstitutional and enjoined the city from enforcing the ordinance against respondent employee in the employee's declaratory judgment action.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employees were attorneys for the corporation counsel. They resided in the city but wished to live elsewhere. The challenged city ordinance provided that an employee who failed to reside in the city forfeited his employment. The employee contended that the ordinance was inconsistent with N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2(c)(1) and, therefore, unenforceable due to its conflict with general state law. The city likened its ordinance to the residency qualifications for state and local officers. The court reversed, holding that the ordinance was not invalid. State statutes expressly required continuing residency throughout the period of employment for public officers under N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect;&sect; 3, 30(1)(d). The ordinance was designed with the legitimate purpose of encouraging city employees to maintain a commitment and involvement with the government that employed them by living within the city. Residence was a consideration unrelated to job performance, misconduct, or competency. It was a qualification of employment and a qualification that the city was allowed to impose without running afoul of the state constitution or the general laws of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from an order of the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which entered a judgment convicting him, upon his pleas of guilty, of attempted possession of a weapon as a felony.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, who was standing for some time outside of a liquor store, was kept under surveillance by police officers who believed that he was casing the store. A rifle was found on defendant when he was approached and his coat was opened. At trial, neither officer testified that he feared for his physical safety or that he noticed any bulge in defendant's clothing before discovering the rifle. Defendant's motions to suppress the rifle and statements made subsequent to the arrest were denied by the trial court. Defendant pleaded guilty to attempted possession of a weapon as a felony. On appeal, the court found that defendant's conduct was not sufficient to create a founded suspicion that a crime was at hand, as his earlier acts were consistent with innocent behavior and the entire sequence of events was devoid of any objective evidence to justify the officers' suspicions. The seizure of the rifle and arrest were thus unconstitutional, and defendant's post-arrest statements should have been suppressed as fruits of an unconstitutional search. As such, the court reversed the conviction, granted the motion to suppress, vacated the plea, and dismissed the indictment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Because defendant's conduct was insufficient to create any suspicion in officers that a crime was being committed and the subsequent seizure of the rifle and arrest of defendant was unconstitutional, defendant's post-arrest statements should have been suppressed, as they were fruits of an unconstitutional search.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Justifiable Police Intrusion Short of Probable Cause to Arrest</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. There is a sliding scale of justifiable police intrusion, short of probable cause to arrest, which correlates the allowable intensity of police conduct to the nature and weight of the facts precipitating intrusion. There are three distinct levels of intrusion: the first is the right of a police officer, in the absence of any concrete indication of criminality, to approach an individual for the purpose of requesting information if he has some articulable reason sufficient to justify the action and the basis for the inquiry need not rest on any indication of criminal activity on the part of the person of whom the inquiry is made; the second and more intense level of intrusion is the police officer's common-law right to inquire which is activated by a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot and carries with it the right to interfere with a citizen to the extent necessary, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  short of a forcible seizure, to obtain an explanation; and the third level encompasses the statutory right ( CPL 140.50, subd 1) authorizing a forcible stop and detention of a person where a police officer entertains a reasonable suspicion that the person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a felony or misdemeanor, and as a corollary to the statutory right to detain, an officer also has the statutory right to frisk if he reasonably suspects himself to be physically endangered.  ( CPL 140.50, subd 3.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. In order to determine the legality of police conduct regarding a search and seizure, the first consideration is whether the action was justified in its inception and then whether the conduct was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Reasonable Suspicion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. In order for police to have the right to detain an individual, to the extent necessary to obtain explanatory information, they must have a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot and in testing the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">bona fides</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> of a founded suspicion of criminal activity, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  a mere hunch or gut reaction will not suffice, nor will a sincere, good faith belief by the police that a crime is about to be committed, without objective evidence of criminal activity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Reasonable Suspicion</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Two police officers, who approached defendant while in a telephone booth as he held the telephone receiver in one hand and had his other hand in his coat pocket after he had been observed by the police officers for most of the previous 20 minutes standing near a liquor store, may not constitutionally search defendant where neither officer feared for his physical safety nor noticed any bulge in defendant's clothing as defendant's conduct was not such as could generate a founded suspicion that a crime was at hand in that while it may be argued that his conduct was not inconsistent with the possibility that defendant was &quot;casing&quot; the liquor store, his conduct was equally consistent with innocent behavior and as such there was no element of objective evidence to justify the officer's suspicion; accordingly, the weapon found on defendant's person, by reason of the unconstitutional search, must be suppressed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4"> Search and Seizure -- Police Inquiry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Neither the common-law right to inquire nor the statutory right ( CPL 140.50, subd 1) to inquire permits seizures, but only entitles the police to ask questions of an individual where they have a founded suspicion that criminal activity is afoot and a search is not authorized unless the officer reasonably suspects that he is in danger of physical harm.  ( CPL 140.50, subd 3.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Police Inquiry</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The mere placement of one's hand in one's pocket does not create a suspicion that an individual is armed so as to permit a police officer to search the individual pursuant to CPL 140.50 (subd 3) which authorizes such a search where the officer reasonably suspects that he is in danger of physical harm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Confessions</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Postarrest statements, preceded by </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c11">Miranda</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> warnings, are rendered constitutionally infirm if a prior seizure and arrest are illegal; accordingly, such statements must be suppressed as they are the fruits of an unconstitutional search.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs filed a class action suit against defendants seeking declaratory and injunctive relief with regard to visitation, recreation, and discipline in the county jail. However, the trial court denied plaintiffs relief. On appeal, the court affirmed but modified the trial court's order, holding that it was neither rationally nor constitutionally supportable to deny contact visitation to each plaintiff. The court further held that defendants were charged with the responsibility of implementing a contact visitation program that would not compromise the jail's security. The court also held that the economic factors in implementing the contact visitation program may be considered in implementing the plan, but such costs could not be used to deny qualified plaintiffs contact visitation. Finally, the court held that plaintiffs had received adequate recreational activities and that the length of the visitations was best deferred to defendants' determination.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- Limitations on Constitutional Rights</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The fact of the lawful incarceration of prisoners and the needs of the penal institutions impose limitations on the constitutional rights of prisoners.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- Administration of Prisons</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. While the courts should defer to the discretion of correction officials in matters concerning prison administration and the needs of institutional security, prisoner complaints relating to restrictions and procedures must be examined in terms of the legitimate policies and goals of the correction system and the courts will intervene to stop unconstitutional or illegal practices.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- Conditions of Confinement -- Equal Protection of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Pretrial detainees in the Monroe County Jail have not been denied equal protection of the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  law when their conditions of confinement are compared with the conditions of sentenced prisoners in State correctional facilities, for they rely on the treatment of members of a class distinct from their own and the differences afford a rational basis for disparate treatment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- Contact Visitation</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The failure to provide a program of contact visitation constitutes a deprivation of the constitutional rights of pretrial detainees, but all such prisoners are not to be afforded contact visitation rights without regard to considerations of institutional stability and security, for to do so would be an unjustifiable incursion into matters within the expertise of those entrusted with prison administration to whose judgment the manner of implementation of an acceptable program must be left.  Such a program for female detainees in the Monroe County Jail must be instituted within a reasonable period of time and, while a lack of finances may not be employed as a basis for denial, economic factors may be taken into account in determining the manner and method used to provide contact visitation.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  5. The duration of visitation periods within a county jail is a matter properly left to the judgment of those entrusted with prison administration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- Recreation Facilities</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The mental or physical well-being of female inmates in the Monroe County Jail is adequately safeguarded by current practices with respect to recreational facilities and access to the gymnasium; any expansion of recreational opportunity for such inmates is not constitutionally mandated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- Disciplinary Rules</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. An inmate's attitude and general adjustment to the discipline and order of a correctional facility, as well as the facts and circumstances of an infraction, are proper considerations in the imposition of sanctions; it is sufficient that the imposition of punishment or the withholding of privileges are subject to review.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed a judgment of the trial court, which had denied appellants' petition. The constitutional allocation of Civil Court judgeships by counties within the city requirement was a minimal standard intended to confine the judgeships to city residents and implied a constitutionally permissible requirement of residency within the county from which elected.

The applicant's request for an interim permit for the alteration of the freshwater wetlands properties was denied. The applicant argued that the use restrictions imposed on the applicant's land by the Freshwater Wetlands Act and its regulations, unless struck down, constituted a taking. The court reversed based on its determination that the restrictions imposed on the applicant's land were invalid under due process considerations because they rendered the property unsuitable for any reasonable income productive or other private use for which it was adapted, thereby destroying its economic value. The commissioner was directed to decide whether to grant the permit requested or, if he deemed the wetlands sufficiently valuable for society's purposes, proceed under the condemnation law to acquire title.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 1. Statutes, such as the Freshwater Wetlands Act ( ECL art 24), which impose use restrictions on wetlands are an effort to preserve a particular piece of private property for the benefit of the community at large, not an attempt to direct the course of future development, or zoning in the usual sense, but an effort to foreclose any development, and thus may be subject to a standard for measuring their constitutionality other than that applied to measure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the constitutionality of zoning, i.e., whether the zoning restriction in question prohibits all reasonable use of the property; however, even if the Freshwater Wetlands Act is generically a mere form of zoning and the traditional test of constitutionality is to be applied, the denial to the owners of private wetlands of a permit which would allow them to remove humus, sand and gravel from the properties, a use concededly inconsistent with the expressed policy of the act, but, on the evidence adduced at the hearing, the only use of the properties which could produce a reasonable economic return, constitutes a taking without just compensation; accordingly, the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation must either grant the permit or, if he deems the wetlands sufficiently valuable for society's purposes, proceed under the Condemnation Law to acquire title.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, fire department and others, challenged judgments entered by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court (New York) that declared certain sections of the fire safety requirements and controls applicable to high-rise office buildings in New York City and sections of the fire drill and evacuation rules, void and enjoined enforcement thereof.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court held that New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 5 (1973), as amended by New York City, N.Y., Local Laws No. 26 (1975), was unconstitutional, extremely costly, and imposed an unreasonable burden upon plaintiffs without contributing significantly to fire safety. On appeal, the court found that the law was constitutional and the product of a reasonable exercise of police power. In so holding, the court determined that (1) its contribution towards the achievement of public safety in high-rise office buildings and the capability of building owners to comply with its requirements were matters for legislative insight, not judicial hindsight; (2) the extra-legislative hearings to determine whether enactment would contribute to achieving greater public safety were inappropriate; (3) promulgation of rules by the Fire Commissioner to carry out the basic purpose of law was a valid exercise of his powers; and (4) the trial court made no attempt to compare the cost of compliance with the full or assessed value of any affected parcel, although that test was often used where the validity of a law requiring additional facilities to assure public health and safety was challenged .</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The fire safety requirements and controls applicable to certain high-rise office buildings in the City of New York (Local Laws, 1973, No.  5, as amd by Local Laws, 1975, No. 26), by &quot;exempting&quot; existing buildings, in which complete sprinkler protection is provided, from the requirement to provide either a stairwell pressurization system to control smoke or a massive vertical smoke shaft penetrating the entire height of the building with duct work extending throughout each floor (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; C26-504.15, subd [c]), which system, because of impracticability, is applicable only to new construction, did not eliminate sprinklerization&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  as an option to smoke control thereby leaving the stairwell pressurization system as the only acceptable method of smoke control in unsprinklered buildings since the legislative history of Local Law No. 5 indicates that complete sprinkler installation was perceived as being in lieu of smoke shafts and stairwell pressurization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Fire Safety in Office Buildings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Local Law No. 5 of 1973 of the City of New York (as amd by Local Laws, 1975, No. 26) which, in amending the city's Building Code and Fire Prevention Code, requires certain existing high-rise office buildings to provide a fire safety plan &quot;for fire drill and evacuation procedure&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; C19-161.2); an &quot;interior fire alarm and voice communication system&quot;, including elevator recall, to alert occupants to danger and to direct safe evacuation and effective internal fire-fighting to be completed within three years (Administrative Code, &sect; C26-1704.5); and, in centrally air-conditioned buildings, either complete sprinklering or both subdivision of open-floor areas with fire-resistant partitions and a system of smoke control to provide for safe evacuation to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be completed within 15 years unless the commissioner, because of practical difficulty or undue hardship, waives or modifies the requirements and accepts alternatives (Administrative Code, &sect; C26.504.1), is constitutional being the product of reasonable exercise of the police power in the field of public safety in high-rise office buildings, a field best left for legislative insight, not judicial hindsight.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Fire Safety</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A Legislature may, as a proper exercise of the police power, require building owners to make improvements essential to the reduction of fire hazards even though experts might differ as to the most appropriate way to cope with fire hazards; courts should be wary of substituting their economic and business judgment for that of legislative bodies and should avoid the temptation to sit as a super-Legislature to weigh the wisdom of legislation.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Police Power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. The doctrine that due process authorizes courts to strike as unconstitutional laws which they find are the result of unwise legislative action has been discarded and is no longer a valid constitutional concept nor does it represent the law of&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  this State.  Accordingly, when dealing with the police power to protect the public safety, it is for the Legislature to decide what regulations are needed to reduce fire hazards to the minimum and it may properly adopt the most conservative course which science and engineering offer to avoid taking the chance that human life will be lost.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Fire Safety in Office Buildings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Since the alterations and installations proposed under the fire safety requirements and controls applicable to certain high-rise office buildings in the City of New York (Local Laws, 1973, No. 5, as amd by Local Laws, 1975, No. 26) including the installation of an interior alarm-communication system, and, in centrally air-conditioned buildings, either complete sprinklering or both subdivision of open-floor areas with fire-resistant partitions and a system of smoke control, are reasonably calculated to obtain their objective of fire safety, the danger to which the valid exercise of police power relates being &quot;reasonably apprehended&quot;, and, therefore, extra-legislative hearings to determine whether the legislative enactment would contribute to achieving greater public safety are&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***7]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  inappropriate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Fire Safety in Office Buildings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Trial Term, in invalidating most of the major fire safety innovations required for certain high-rise office buildings in the City of New York (Local Laws, 1973, No. 5, as amd by Local Laws, 1975, No. 26) including the installation of an interior alarm-communications system (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; C26-1704.5) and, in centrally air-conditioned buildings, either complete sprinklering or both subdivision of open-floor areas with fire-resistant partitions and a system of smoke control (Administrative Code, &sect; C26-504.15), upon the grounds that compliance &quot;would impose an unreasonable burden upon plaintiffs without contributing significantly to fire safety&quot; based upon an estimation of the cost of compliance per square foot and the gross cost to the buildings industry as a whole, improperly made no attempt to relate the cost of compliance to capital investment, market value or even assessed value of all the buildings affected or to any particular property even though those are the tests often used in instances where the validity of a law requiring additional facilities to assure public&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***8]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  health and safety is challenged.  The effect of a law on the economics of a particular property, rather than its impact on an industry generally, determines whether regulation constitutes confiscation.  Although compliance with the fire safety requirements imposes an economic burden on building owners, the costs are not so onerous as to render the legislation invalid.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Fire Safety in Office Buildings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Whether the stairwell pressurization system required for certain high-rise office buildings in the City of New York as an alternate method of controlling smoke (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; C26-504.1), which system must comply with a reference performance standard, is technically sound and reliable is not dispositive of the constitutionality of such fire safety requirement since scientific precision is not a criterion of constitutional power.  So long as there is a reasonable basis in available scientific information and rationality in chosen courses of conduct to alleviate an accepted evil, there is no constitutional infirmity.  In any event, variances from the performance standards are available from the Board of Standards and Appeals&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  where compliance presents &quot;practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship&quot;.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Fire Safety in Office Buildings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Trial Term improperly invalidated the statutory fire safety requirement that certain high-rise office buildings in the City of New York install interior alarm-communications systems within a three-year period (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; C26-1704.5) on the ground that &quot;the time for production and installation of such systems set forth in the law is inadequate&quot; since several alarm systems had been approved for use by the Board of Standards and Appeals in 1973, and, in any event, extensions of time were readily available whenever necessary for good-faith compliance with the law.  (New York City Charter, &sect; 666, subd 7.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Installation of Safety Equipment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. Where a Board of Standards and Appeals is authorized by law to modify statutory provisions requiring the installation of safety equipment whenever practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship might otherwise result in an unconstitutional deprivation or denial of due process (see New York City&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Charter, &sect; 666, subd 7), invalidation of the statutory provisions prior to application for and denial of such relief is premature since there is no deprivation until there has been application for a permit and unreasonable refusal.  A statute does not violate the Constitution where it does not deprive an owner unreasonably of his property if the statute is properly administered according to its terms.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Fire Safety in Office Buildings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The Fire Commissioner of the City of New York, in carrying out the lawful statutory requirement that certain high-rise office buildings provide a fire safety plan &quot;for fire drill and evacuation procedure in accordance with the requirements of the commissioner&quot; in which all &quot;occupants of the building shall participate and co-operate&quot; (Administrative Code of City of New York, &sect; C19-161.2), validly promulgated fire drill and evacuation rules which created the positions of fire warden and deputy fire warden to be filled by employees of tenants in the buildings since the creation of the positions was a logical extension and implementation of the legislative intent of the statute.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Granting class action status in a suit brought by building owners to invalidate fire safety requirements and controls applicable to certain high-rise office buildings in the City of New York (Local Laws, 1973, No.  5, as amd by Local Laws, 1975, No. 26) because compliance costs would constitute a confiscation of private property, is improper since each real estate owner and each parcel of property subject to the law is affected to a different degree.  Since each owner is entitled to seek an extension or variance or modification from the Board of Standards and Appeals (New York City Charter, &sect; 666, subd 7), the appropriate remedy for those aggrieved by the statute is to apply individually to the board and then any adverse ruling from the board could be reviewed in an article 78 proceeding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Fire Safety in Office Buildings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. Since any defects and inequities inherent in the fire safety requirements and controls applicable to certain high-rise office buildings in the City of New York (Local Laws, 1973, No. 5, as amd by Local Laws, 1975, No. 26) are matters for the legislative body and not for the&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***12]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  judiciary, the invalidation by Trial Term of most of the major safety innovations required by the statute and the substitution of its judgment for that of the City Council cannot be sustained.  </SPAN></P>

XVI, &sect; 1 and that were enacted without a home rule message in violation of N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The museum planned to develop a condominium tower in its air space and a museum wing. The state legislature enacted the SCRA and the CCRA to make the development possible through the grant of tax exemptions and condemnation power. The landowner's hotel was adjacent to the museum, and the museum sought to extinguish the landowner's air rights and an easement. The landowner filed an action against the museum. The trial court found in favor of the museum, and the landowner appealed. The court reversed, entering summary judgment for the landowner. The court held that the SCRA and the CCRA were unconstitutional. The statutory scheme was infirm because its eligibility requirements were so restrictive that within the entire state, the only institution that qualified for its benefits was the museum. There was no reasonable possibility that another cultural institution would ever become eligible. Accordingly, the SCRA was a special law masquerading as a general law. Allowing tax exemptions under it violated N.Y. Const. art. XVI, &sect; 1. The condemnation power of the CCRA was not for a public use, so it violated N.Y. Const. art. IX, &sect; 2 because it was enacted without a home rule message.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that &sect; 2402, as amended, was constitutional, that the message of necessity sent by the governor to the legislature for an immediate vote on a bill that amended &sect; 2402 was reasonable, that the newly enacted fee schedule did not deny citizens the right of access to the surrogate's court, and that such charges did not constitute taxes. The legislature was in a far better position than a reviewing court to weigh the variable factors which might have had a bearing on the fiscal problem.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Chapter 33 of the Laws of 1977 which amended SCPA 2402 to establish a single, State-wide schedule for fees paid in Surrogate's Court proceedings is constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. A message of necessity sent by the Governor to the Legislature for an immediate vote on a bill, which included an amendment to SCPA 2402 setting fees in Surrogate's Court proceedings and which message stated that its enactment was necessary in connection with the 1977-1978 budget, complied with section 14 of article III of the New York Constitution; it was reasonable for the Governor to certify that legislative action was imperative in order that court fees would be fixed prior to the beginning of the fiscal year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Courts -- Nullification of Act of Governor</SPAN></P>

A newly enacted schedule of fees to be paid in Surrogate's Court proceedings contained in SCPA 2402 does not deny citizens the right of access to that court for the fees are commensurate with the value of the estate or subject matter of the proceeding and, therefore, it may not be said that due process&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  is offended by denying access to the courts solely because of inability to pay; moderate filing fees are constitutionally permissible.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. The charges fixed in SCPA 2402 to be paid in Surrogate's Court proceedings do not constitute taxes imposed in violation of section 22 of article III of the New York Constitution, which requires that tax laws state the tax and the object to which it is to be applied, but pertain to specific court proceedings and are payable one time only to the court within which the proceedings are brought, thus presumptively establishing them as fees and not taxes.  Although the fees imposed may exceed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the cost or expense to a Surrogate's Court incurred in connection therewith that does not make the fee schedule a general revenue measure or tax, for it is unrealistic to require that court fees may be imposed only to the extent that they directly offset the operating costs of the collecting court which may not be fully determined solely by review of a court's local budget.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, governor and state agency, challenged the judgment of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), that declared Executive Order No. 45, N.Y. Comp. Codes R. &amp; Regs. tit. 9, &sect; 3.45, unconstitutional, enjoined its implementation, and directed cancellation of implementing rules. Respondents, unions, contractors, and trade associations, brought the action for review of the order imposing affirmative action goals in state contracts.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The governor issued Executive Order No. 45, which called for the establishment of affirmative action goals in state contracts, and the state agency issued implementing regulations. Respondents challenged Executive Order No. 45 and the implementing regulations, asserting that the initiatives were unconstitutional exercises of legislative power by the executive branch. The supreme court ruled in favor of respondents. On appeal from that judgment, the court held that Executive Order No. 45 exceeded the governor's authority because it extended and expanded the requirements of N.Y. Lab. Law &sect; 220-e and N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 296(12), which prohibited discrimination in state contracts and permitted contractors to implement state-approved affirmative action programs. Neither of those statutes implied that contractors were obligated to establish affirmative action programs regardless of their status as discriminators or non-discriminators. By issuing Executive Order No. 45, the governor assumed the power of the legislature to set state policy in an area of increasing public concern. The court further found that respondents had standing to bring the action. The court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Governor -- Imposition of Affirmative Action Programs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. An Executive Order promulgated by the Governor, which provides that all State contracts shall require contractors to undertake affirmative action programs for minority manpower utilization and that, before a contract is awarded, contractors must submit such programs, exceeds the authority of the executive, for the Legislature did not see fit to encompass in the statutes an affirmative action program and did not require&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that contractors must submit a program of affirmative action. The Executive Order goes beyond any specific requirement that contractors follow nondiscriminatory hiring practices and beyond the mere requirement that regulations be developed by the Commissioner of Human Rights and, therefore, is unenforceable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Since an Executive Order requires contractors to submit affirmative action programs for minority manpower utilization before a State contract is awarded dehors the existence of any rules or regulations, there is a justiciable controversy as to the legality-enforceability of the order and, accordingly, there is no lack of standing to maintain an action challenging the order.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review of an order from the Supreme Court (New York), which granted defendant police officer's motion to dismiss an indictment charging him with three counts of perjury in the first degree on the grounds of collateral estoppel, after the trial court found him guilty.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state sought review after the trial court granted defendant police officer's motion to dismiss an indictment charging him with three counts of perjury in the first degree. The trial court found defendant guilty, but granted the dismissal on the grounds of collateral estoppel, based upon the earlier acquittal of defendant's partner. On appeal, the court found that trial court erred in applying the doctrine of collateral estoppel because the subject of the prior prosecution was whether defendant's partner had perjured himself before the grand jury. Resolution of that issue had no legal bearing upon the independent issue of whether defendant committed perjury before the same grand jury. Therefore, the ultimate issue of defendant's perjury had not been previously litigated. Finally, the court concluded that reversal was neither violative of nor precluded by the principles underlying the prohibition against double jeopardy because the trial court had already found defendant guilty as charged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court erred in dismissing the indictment against defendant police officer on the grounds of collateral estoppel, therefore the order dismissing the indictment was reversed, the determination of defendant's guilt was reinstated and the proceeding was remanded for sentence imposition.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Collateral Estoppel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Collateral estoppel may only be invoked in criminal cases where there is an identity of parties as well as an identity of issue.  Accordingly, where two defendants were indicted for perjury concerning their testimony before a Grand Jury, an acquittal of one defendant on a prior trial does not operate to preclude a subsequent trial and conviction of a second defendant although both were indicted in connection with the same transaction; collateral estoppel is inapplicable as there is no identity of parties and the fact that one defendant was acquitted has no legal bearing upon the independent&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  issue of whether the second defendant committed perjury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Judgments -- Collateral Estoppel</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The doctrine of collateral estoppel may be applied in civil cases where (1) there is an identity of issue necessarily decided in the prior action and decisive of the present suit and (2) there was a full and fair opportunity afforded to the party against whom the estoppel is sought to be invoked to contest the decision now said to be controlling; thus the litigant barred in civil cases by collateral estoppel must have had an opportunity to contest the precise issue resolved in the prior action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Former Jeopardy</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The policies underlying the prohibition against double jeopardy are not violated by a reversal and remand where such will require neither a retrial nor any supplemental findings as to defendant's guilt. Accordingly, a defendant is not placed in double jeopardy by a reversal and remand where the trial court found him guilty but erroneously dismissed the indictment due to a misapplication of the doctrine of collateral estoppel as the only matter to be considered on remand is the appropriate sentence. </SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Sheriffs and Constables -- Custody and Control of County Jails</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Custody and control of county jails have not been conferred upon Sheriffs by the Constitution, although it declares them to be local constitutional officers (NY Const, art XIII, &sect; 13), but by statute (Correction Law, &sect; 500-c), and, having conferred those powers and duties, the Legislature has the power to limit, curtail or abolish them.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Constitutional Law -- Delegation by Legislature of Rule-Making Power</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Legislature may constitutionally grant rule-making power to the discretion of others, provided it limits the field in which they are to operate and provides standards to govern its exercise; it need not provide a precise and specific formula so long as it provides standards&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and guides in a broad outline, leaving to administrative officials the duty of arranging the details.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- State Commission of Correction</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3 The standards set forth in subdivision 6 of section 45 of the Correction Law, which authorizes the State Commission of Correction to &quot;[promulgate] rules and regulations establishing minimum standards for the care, custody, correction, treatment, supervision, discipline, and other correctional programs for all persons confined in correctional facilities&quot;, are not so vague, indefinite or imprecise as to render them invalid; inherent in the delegation of the power to establish &quot;minimum&quot; standards is the requirement that the standards established be reasonable and not arbitrary or capricious in view of the subject matter to be regulated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Administrative Law -- Rule-Making Power of Administrative Agencies</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Administrative agencies can only promulgate rules to further the implementation of the law as it exists, and they have no authority to create a rule out of harmony with the statute or statutes being implemented.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and Prisoners -- State Commission of Correction -- Regulations</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining defendants from using or occupying certain premises for any purpose and ordering that the premises be closed and vacated. The court found that there was sufficient evidence to warrant the preliminary injunction and closing order under New York City, N.Y., Admin. Code &sect; C16-2.6, C16-2.8 and N.Y. Pub. Health Law &sect; 2321(5). However, the court found that the premises was a hotel wherein it appeared that the tenants of most of the rooms in the hotel had nothing to do with the prostitution and that the hotel was their home. The court found that, at least until such time as there was a final judgment, it would work an unjust hardship on such tenants to require them to leave their homes, the necessary effect of an order requiring the closing of the entire hotel. Accordingly, the court modified the order appealed from so as to limit the closing order.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner retiree sought review of a decision the State Human Rights Appeal Board (New York), which affirmed the human rights division's dismissal of retiree's complaint, charging that respondent division of state police discriminated against him on the basis of age. Retiree claimed that N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 381-b(e), mandating retirement from the state police at age 55, violated N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 296(3-a) and U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The retiree became employed by the division of state police in 1947. In 1969, when he was 50 years old, the state enacted a statute providing for a mandatory retirement age of 55 for officers entering the force after 1969. Officers already in service could elect to be covered under the plan. The retiree elected to be covered and withdrew his election to be covered under the previous plan, which provided for a mandatory retirement age of 70. Petitioner retired at age 55 and then filed a complaint with the State Division of Human Rights, charging age discrimination. The Division dismissed the complaint, finding that it did not have jurisdiction because of an irreconcilable conflict between N.Y. Ret. &amp; Soc. Sec. Law &sect; 381-b and N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 296, which prohibited age discrimination. The Appeals Board affirmed. Retiree sought review under N.Y. Exec. Law &sect; 298 and the court affirmed, finding that unlawful discriminatory practices were limited to those set forth in &sect; 296, which excepted retirement policies. The two statutes did not conflict because the retirement plan was not a subterfuge to evade the age discrimination laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court confirmed the judgment in favor of the division of state police and ordered the petition dismissed. The court declared the statute setting the mandatory retirement age at 55 to be constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Retirement and Pension Benefits -- Unlawful Age Discrimination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Mandatory retirement at age 55 for uniformed members of the State Police under subdivision e of section 381-b of the Retirement and Social Security Law is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of the age discrimination provisions of the Executive Law and, therefore, is not within its ban on age discrimination.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Retirement and Pension Benefits -- Unlawful Age Discrimination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Inasmuch as subdivision e of section 381-b of the Retirement and Social Security Law, calling for mandatory retirement of uniformed State Police at age 55, and subdivision 3-a of section 296 of the Executive Law, prohibiting unlawful age discrimination in employment, can be read together in a consistent manner, there is&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  no conflict between the two statutes; even if the two statutes could not be reconciled, section 381-b would prevail because it was enacted at a later date.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Retirement and Pension Benefits -- Unlawful Age Discrimination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. The Legislature did not intend to repeal subdivision e of section 381-b of the Retirement and Social Security Law, providing for mandatory retirement of uniformed State Police at age 55, by its subsequent definition of &quot;civil right&quot; in subdivision 1 of section 291 of the Executive Law to include freedom from age discrimination, since it had expressly excepted qualified retirement plans from &quot;unlawful discriminatory practices&quot; relating to age discrimination ever since the enactment of subdivision 3-a of section 296 of the Executive Law, prior to the adoption of section 381-b.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil Service -- Retirement and Pension Benefits -- Unlawful Age Discrimination</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. In view of the demanding nature of uniformed police work, mandatory retirement for uniformed State Police officers at age 55 under subdivision e of section 381-b of the Retirement and Social Security Law does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, &nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***5]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  even though a mandatory retirement age of 60 is allowed for higher level personnel.</SPAN></P>

C.P.L.R. art. 78, of the decision of the Supreme Court at Special Term (New York), which upheld the determination of respondent, the Department of State of the State of New York (Secretary of State), that suspended the brokerage firm's real estate broker's license for violation of N.Y. Real Prop. Law &sect; 441-c.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The brokerage firm filled out a purchase offer form for the buyers to sign, which set the purchase price, detailed the terms of a purchase-money mortgage, and recited that the offer was subject to the seller's attorney's approval and the buyers deposit with the brokerage firm of their down payment to serve as commission in the event of default. The purchase offer form used by the brokerage firm contained no caveat alerting the parties that, when signed, the instrument became a binding contract, and cautioning them that it was preferable for them to consult an attorney. When the buyer decided to terminate the contract, he was informed that the down payment would not be returned. The buyer reported the matter to the Secretary of State which charged the brokerage firm with untrustworthiness and suspended its license. On appeal, the trial court affirmed. The court upheld the determination of violation of &sect; 441-c, but held that because of the erratic enforcement of the statute, the brokerage firm should have only been censured. The court held that the brokerage firm engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by inserting the detailed terms of the mortgage in the offer.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The preparation of simple contracts in real estate transactions by real estate brokers and agents who have a personal interest in the transaction but have not held themselves out to be attorneys at law does not constitute unauthorized practice of law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Brokers -- Real Estate Brokers -- Unauthorized Practice of Law</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The privilege accorded to real estate brokers and agents to prepare simple real estate contracts&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  must be circumscribed for the benefit of the public to ensure that such professionals do not exceed the bounds of their competence and, to the detriment of the innocent public, prepare documents the execution of which requires a lawyer's scrutiny and expertise.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. A real estate broker who not only used a purchase offer which did not contain a clause alerting the buyer to see his attorney before signing it but also inserted the detailed terms of a purchase-money mortgage in the offer, went beyond the privilege extended to brokers to prepare simple real estate contracts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Brokers -- Real Estate Brokers -- Untrustworthiness</SPAN></P>

A determination by the Secretary of State that the acts of petitioner, a real estate broker who prepared a purchase offer contract in which he inserted the detailed terms of a purchase-money mortgage but failed to alert the buyer to see his attorney before signing it, constituted the practice of law, thus rendering petitioner untrustworthy and incompetent as a licensed realtor within the provisions of section 441-c of the Real Property Law, was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>

In light of the previous practice on the part of real estate brokers and agents in respect to the preparation of simple real estate contracts, and the narrow line between permitted and forbidden services by them in this area and the prior feeble and erratic enforcement of section 441-c of the Real Property Law by the respondent Secretary of State, the action of respondent in suspending petitioner real estate broker's license for having gone beyond the privilege extended to brokers to prepare such contracts was excessive and the punishment should be reduced to censure only.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner teachers appealed the order of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which dismissed the teachers' petition against respondents, Commissioner of Mental Health and others, that challenged the requirement to work an extra hour violated state law and the equal protection clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The teachers, by an order of the commissioner, were required to teach an extra hour for mentally retarded children. The teachers brought suit and claimed that they should be treated like other teachers. The trial court dismissed he petition, and the teachers appealed. The court found that the commissioner was not required to limit the number of hours that the teachers were required to teach. Further, the court found that the requirement to teach extra hours did not violate the equal protection clause, as there was a reasonable basis for the commissioner's order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court, which dismissed the teachers' petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Teachers -- Increase in Hours of Attendance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Pursuant to an order of the Commissioner of Mental Hygiene, the hours in attendance of teachers employed by the department to instruct mentally handicapped children were properly increased by one hour to six hours which was one hour more than the hours of teachers of handicapped children throughout the State.  Section 175.5 (a) of the Regulations of the Commissioner of Education does not require five as opposed to six hours but rather sets forth the minimum number of hours that schools must be in session to receive State aid and Part 200 of the regulations (handicapped children) does not indicate that the requiring of six hours is prohibited.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Teachers -- Increase in Hours of Attendance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The Mental Hygiene Law confers on the Commissioner of Mental Hygiene authority to operate facilities under his jurisdiction without any obligation to conform&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the teaching hours of institution teachers with those of other teachers of mentally handicapped children throughout the State.  Section 15.11 of the statute mandates that the department provide school-age patients with an education comparable to what they would receive in their local districts but does not regulate the maximum number of hours of its teachers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Schools -- Teachers -- Increase in Hours of Attendance</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Since conditions in State facilities may be sufficiently distinguishable from those in noninstitutional settings to require more teaching time to obtain substantially the same results as elsewhere, a directive of the Commissioner of Mental Hygiene requiring an additional hour of teaching by department teachers of mentally handicapped children has a rational basis and is not unconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause. </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employees sought review from judgments of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which dismissed petitions to invalidate certain rules promulgated under N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court was called upon to determine if certain rules promulgated by the chairman governing personal investments of employees of the PSC and PSD, as well as investments of members of their families, were beyond the authority of the chairman as delegated by the provisions of N.Y. Pub. Serv. Law &sect; 9 and N.Y. Pub. Off. Law &sect; 74. The court held that rules one through five extended and expanded the delegated authority of the generic statutes and were an unwarranted exercise of legislative power. Thus, the delegated discretion was unfettered and the attempt of the chairman to supply specifics was an impermissible extension and expansion of his delegated authority. Accordingly, because the enactment of rules one through five was an unwarranted exercise of legislative power, the court concluded that the entire regulatory scheme was unconstitutional and reversed the trial court's judgments.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The State has a legitimate interest in the financial privacy of employees working in a State agency charged with critical and sensitive duties of supervision, and statutes which express that interest (Public Service Law, &sect; 9; Public Officers Law, &sect; 74; Executive Law, &sect; 74) are constitutional.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Legislation may constitutionally confer discretion upon an administrative agency, and a precise or specific formula need not be furnished in a field where flexibility in fashioning rules in furtherance of that legislation is desirable in light of the complexities extant in the area sought to be circumscribed; the Legislature may enact statutes in broad outline, leaving administrative details to the appropriate enforcing administrative official.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. A statute prescribing annual financial reporting for private proprietary homes for adults is not precluded by or in violation of the provisions of section 2 of article XVII of the State Constitution, since that section, rather than limiting the powers of the State Board of Social Welfare to visitation, inspection and supervision of homes for the aged, affirms the right of the board to properly exercise its inherent police powers to further regulate the operation of homes for the aged.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Juvenile Delinquent -- Judicial Certification of Mentally Retarded Child</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The Family Court has jurisdiction to commit a juvenile to the Department of Mental Hygiene if it is alleged&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the juvenile is a delinquent in a situation where, prior to being adjudicated pursuant to article 7 of the Family Court Act, he is found to be incompetent to defend himself in such proceeding, provided such jurisdiction is exercised in a manner consistent with the juvenile's constitutional right to due process.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 231 of the Family Court Act (L 1976, ch 853, &sect; 4), providing for judicial certification of mentally retarded children, was not repealed by implication with the recodification of the Mental Hygiene Law in 1972, inconsistent in that it contains no such provision (Mental Hygiene Law, &sect; 33.27), since although section 231 was re-enacted in 1976 in substantially the same language as its predecessor, it was enacted as an entirely separate statute and therefore will prevail over an inconsistent pre-existing statute.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Judicial Certification of Mentally Retarded Child</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A court-ordered&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  involuntary juvenile commitment pursuant to section 231 of the Family Counrt Act must follow the procedures contained in section 33.27 of the Mental Hygiene Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Juvenile Delinquent -- Judicial Certification of Mentally Retarded Child</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Where a juvenile is found to be incompetent to proceed to an adjudication hearing, and the court finds that the youth is a threat to society as well as to himself, the Family Court can consider the request by the Law Guardian for a competency examination pursuant to CPL article 730 as an application sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 33.27 of the Mental Hygiene Law.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Infants -- Judicial Certification of Mentally Retarded Child</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. In the absence of compliance with the procedures of section 33.27 of the Mental Hygiene Law, the use of sections 255 and 231 of the Family Court Act alone to authorize a commitment fails to guarantee a uniform procedure so that juveniles, subject to being committed involuntarily to the Department of Mental Hygiene, will be subject to the same procedures and the same due process and equal protection of the law.  </SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant assemblyman allegedly sought to obtain a promise from an opponent not to run in an election against defendant.

On appeal, the court affirmed, finding there was sufficient evidence to support the jury's findings that defendant accepted a thing of value, that he acted with corrupt intent, and that defendant deliberately attempted to cause his opponent to refrain from entering the primary in exchange for job offers and money. The appellate court further determined that based upon the facts and all other relevant information considered by the trial court, defendant's sentence was not excessive.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of the trial court convicting defendant of elections offenses was affirmed. The statutes under which defendant was convicted were not unconstitutional, the jury properly found defendant failed to meet his burden of proving the affirmative defense of entrapment, and alleged prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to the level of reversible error.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Affirmative Defense of Entrapment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Under section 40.05 of the Penal Law, the affirmative defense of entrapment can be made out only when the active inducement or encouragement of a public servant or of a person acting in co-operation with a public servant creates a substantial risk that the offense would&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***6]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be committed by a person not otherwise disposed to commit it, and the defendant has the burden of proving such defense by a preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. Participants in conversations with a defendant had a legal right to record those conversations, and violated no rights of the defendant in doing so, and the evidence thus obtained against him was not rendered inadmissible because it was secured during an investigation improperly being conducted by a Special Prosecutor prior to the issuance of an executive order authorizing him to do so.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. Sentencing is a matter resting within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the sentence imposed should not be reduced on appeal unless there is an abuse of that discretion.  </SPAN></P>

Law &sect; 530.50, which provided that bail pending appeal was not available to a defendant who had received a class A felony sentence, was an unconstitutional violation of defendant's right to equal protection of the laws. Respondent granted defendant's application, but withheld signing the order to afford petitioner district attorney the opportunity, pursuant to N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law art. 78, to request a petition prohibiting him from signing the order. On appeal, the court granted the petition, holding that N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 530.50 was constitutional and that respondent was without power to consider defendant's application. Defendant had no constitutional right to bail after conviction. N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 530.50 was rationally related to the legislature's determination that drug offenders constituted an insular class who posed a peculiar threat to society and required especially severe punishment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs commenced the action to declare void an agreement for the construction of a state office complex. Plaintiffs asserted that the agreement was invalid in that it was made in violation of the constitutional prohibition barring the state from incurring debts in the absence of a law authorizing the debt that had been submitted to the voters at a general election. Plaintiffs also sought to permanently restrain the state comptroller from disbursing state tax funds to the county. The trial court granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The trial court properly held that the action was time-barred because the cause of action arose when the allegedly unconstitutional contract was executed, and plaintiffs had the right to file an action as citizen taxpayers under N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law &sect; 51 at any time after the execution of the contract. The action was also barred by laches because plaintiffs did not act diligently in asserting their rights in prosecuting this action for declaratory and injunctive relief, and their delay prejudiced defendants by increasing construction costs and other financial obligations.</SPAN></P>

When he applied for retirement, the retiree requested that his retirement allowance be based on his final average salary for the immediately preceding three-year period. The retirement system calculated the retirement allowance based on the retiree's last three calendar years during which he received his highest compensation, subjected to N.Y. Retire. &amp; Soc. Sec.

The retiree argued that the pension limitation provision was unconstitutional as applied because, when he became vested in his retirement benefits, the benefit plan did not contain any limitation. The court disagreed, holding that the retiree's election to become a member of the Legislative and Executive Retirement Plan was a waiver of his vested pension rights.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The citizen-taxpayers alleged that the 1978-1979 state budget and accompanying appropriation bills as submitted by the governor to the legislature was unconstitutional on the ground that it did not comply with N.Y.

The court affirmed the lower court's decision that the cause of action was premature because the probability of a budget being enacted, which did not correct the alleged defects of the submitted bills, was great. Considering the size of the present work force of the State of New York and the fact that the executive budget was in excess of 11.5 billion dollars, the court concluded that the appropriation bills accompanying the budget were not sufficiently itemized to show what money was to be expended and for what purpose. The court also stated that the transfer provisions in the current appropriation bill was not unconstitutional where the present appropriation bill only permitted intra-program transfers and not interprogram transfers and intra-program transfers were necessary for the purpose of department management of funds.

The court held that: (1) the landlord's warrantless entry and identification of a box with suspicious contents was proper; (2) there was probable cause for a search warrant even without an affidavit from the landlord; (3) the defendant's key to, and familiarity with, the apartment, along with other circumstantial evidence, conclusively linked the defendant's exercise of dominion and control over the apartment to justify the jury's finding that the defendant had constructive possession of the drugs found there; (4) no reasonable theory, other than the defendant's guilt, accounted for defendant's actions; and (5) the strength of the links in the chain of circumstantial evidence mandated affirmance of the defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Unlawful Search and Seizure -- Seizure of Narcotics by Police Based upon Landlord's Entry into Apartment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. The warrantless removal of a box containing suspected narcotics and drug paraphernalia by the police from a virtually vacant upstairs apartment of a two-family residence at the instigation of the landlord, who entered the premises and discovered the box after receiving complaints about the occupants of the second-floor apartment from the downstairs tenant, was proper, justifying the issuance of a search warrant based on the affidavit of a police officer which led to the discovery of additional narcotics in the upstairs apartment. The landlord, in notifying the police after discovering the narcotics, properly acted both as a citizen mindful of his duty and as a landlord mindful of his own self-interest in reporting the possible use of the premises &quot;for any illegal trade, manufacture or other business&quot; (Real Property Law, &sect; 231).  Even assuming that the removal of the box and its contents by the police for field tests was improper, the fact that the landlord intended to disclose the presence of suspected narcotics to the police and to cause an inspection to&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  be made, coupled with the observation by the police of the contents of the box, amply justified the issuance of the search warrant.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Controlled Substances -- Constructive Possession of Drugs</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. The circumstantial evidence of defendant's guilt, including the fact that he possessed the keys to the apartment in which narcotics were found, rent receipts and a business card from the realty agent who rented the apartment, justifies defendant's conviction for possession of drugs and use of drug paraphernalia beyond a reasonable doubt. Where narcotics are found on premises under the &quot;control&quot; of defendant, it may properly be inferred that defendant had both knowledge and &quot;control&quot; of the narcotics sufficient to sustain a conviction for unlawful possession of narcotics. Control of the premises is not necessarily limited to the tenant of rented premises since control can be delegated or shared.  The circumstantial evidence conclusively linked defendant with the exercise of dominion and control over the apartment and as such justified the jury's finding that defendant had constructive possession of the drugs discovered therein.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Circumstantial Evidence</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  3. An appellate court reviewing a verdict based largely on circumstantial evidence need not be convinced to an absolute certainty that there exists no possible hypothesis consistent with defendant's innocence in order to sustain the conviction thereon.  It is sufficient if the circumstantial evidence is &quot;direct, substantial and unequivocal&quot; and the inferences to be drawn from the circumstances are &quot;logically compelling&quot;.  It is for the jury to determine if the circumstances exclude, to a moral certainty, every other &quot;reasonable&quot; hypothesis consistent with defendant's innocence beyond a reasonable doubt. If there is a fair conflict in the evidence such that different inferences can properly be drawn from it, the determination of the jury will not be set aside unless it is clearly against the weight of the evidence or appears to have been influenced by passion, prejudice, mistake or corruption.  </SPAN></P>

Crim. Prac. Law &sect; 60.42 that estopped defendants from cross-examining the victim about her prior conduct because the law was an ex post facto law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted and convicted of rape in the first degree, sodomy in the first degree, sexual abuse in the first degree, and assault in the second degree and challenged their convictions on the basis that the rape-shield law, contained in N.Y.

Law &sect; 60.42 to be constitutional, it nonetheless reversed defendants' convictions. The court held that the evidence that was excluded by the trial court was of substantial probative value and was not offered to demean or harass the victim. The court reasoned that because such evidence went to the victim's credibility, mental and emotional condition, and her ability to perceive and recall past events it did not trigger protection under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect; 60.42. Furthermore, the court held that evidence of three similar false rape complaints was exempted from protection under N.Y. Crim. Proc.

Plaintiffs argued that the concurrent resolution passed by both houses of the legislature in 1976 provided for the purported amendments to the state constitution to be presented for approval and ratification by the people as a single unit and package. The court disagreed with plaintiffs and found that the 1976 concurrent resolution did not contain a single reference to the manner in which the proposed amendments were to be submitted to the electorate for approval. Because it was clear beyond dispute that the wording of the proposed amendments as contained in the concurrent resolution adopted by the 1976 legislature was identical with the wording of the proposed amendments of the concurrent resolution adopted by the 1977 legislature, their approval by the people at the general election held in November 1977 should not have been frustrated.

The court noted that the city could not regulate the performance in the restaurant's premises because the state had pre-empted the field and gave the Authority exclusive jurisdiction to regulate such premises in N.Y.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, the Division of State Police and the Superintendent of New York State Police, challenged the judgment of the Supreme Court, Albany County (New York), which, in proceedings under N.Y. C.P.L.R. 78 filed by petitioner trooper candidates, enjoined respondents from making appointments to the position of trooper in the New York State Police in any manner other than rank order from an existing eligibility list.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents conducted a two-part competitive examination for the purpose of filling state trooper positions. The candidates were ranked in order of their examination scores and were placed on an eligibility list for appointment. When funding for hiring became available, respondents sought to depart from the test results in order to appoint ethnic minorities and female candidates. Petitioners, who were white males on the eligibility list, objected to the procedure. The trial court ruled in favor of petitioners, and the court affirmed. The court held that whatever the motivation, respondents' proposal fell beyond those topics to which consideration was constitutionally limited by N.Y. Const. art. V, &sect; 6 and had to be enjoined. Respondents could not constitutionally depart from the results of the competitive examination in order to make appointments allowing a preference to minorities and females. As respondents' course of conduct plainly exceeded the standard requiring that fitness alone be conclusive, the judgment for petitioners was appropriate.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant town sought review of a judgment from the Supreme Court of Erie County (New York) which granted plaintiff corporation's motion for summary judgment, denied the town's motion for summary judgment, and declared the town's rezoning of the corporation's subject property unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">As part of a comprehensive rezoning map the town enacted a new ordinance which resulted in a portion of the corporation's property being zoned as residential. The corporation filed an action to challenge the zoning ordinance. The trial court held that the rezoning of the corporation's property was unconstitutional, granted the corporation's motion for summary judgment, and denied the town's motion for summary judgment. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and granted the town's motion for summary judgment. The zoning lines drawn by the town allowed many of the surrounding properties to be used for business purposes. However, such invidious zoning lines were inconsequential because the corporation failed to present evidence of the bona fide efforts made to use, sell, or lease the property profitably, so as to entitle it to have such zoning declared invalid as applied to its property. In dismissing the corporation's action without prejudice the court remarked that upon such proof the corporation might succeed in an action to declare the ordinance invalid as to its property.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. When establishing a use district, the fact that properties in the district do not conform to the permitted uses neither prevents the municipality from creating the district nor the owners from continuing their occupation thereof as nonconforming uses, the latter, at least, until the municipality takes steps to phase them out.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Reclassification</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5. A rezoning of property from business to residential use may, in certain circumstances, constitute an unconstitutional or arbitrary exercise of police power, and in such situations an owner may proceed directly to have the ordinance declared invalid as to his property without exhausting his administrative remedies under the ordinance.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Zoning -- Reclassification</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">6. Where plaintiff's property is at the boundary of a residential zone, with commercial zones adjoining on the west, the happenstance that two properties to the northeast and east of it enjoy nonconforming uses cannot serve to render the zoning ordinance invalid as an unconstitutional or arbitrary exercise of the police power.  </SPAN></P>

School officials, acting in loco parentis, had the right to frisk appellant based on a reasonable suspicion that he had a gun. When he made a suspicious movement, they merely grabbed his hand and found a gun in it. Further, the ballistics report was properly admitted under the business records exception to the hearsay rule.

The mayor sued to have the local law determined null and void because the village law was a general law and the Home Rule Law allowed enactment of local laws that were not inconsistent with general laws. The court reversed and remanded the judgment for the mayor. The village law was a general law because it applied to all villages. However, section 10 of the Home Rule Law did not prevent a village from superseding a village law in a way that was inconsistent with the village law. The words not inconsistent with any general law had to be read as being impliedly subject to an exception where the inconsistency has been specifically authorized by the legislature in the same section as the limitation. In order for section 10 of the Home Rule Law to have effect that was the way the statute had to be read.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. That the State Real Property Tax Act (L 1976, ch 349, &sect; 3) is labeled a State tax and that the tax is to be collected by the State and remitted to the cities and school districts through the device of State aid, does not make it a State tax, thus exempting it from the limitations imposed by section 10 of article VIII of the New York State Constitution, since it has the same purpose and effect as the Emergency City and School District Relief Act (L 1976, ch 349, &sect; 2), concededly a measure designed to permit local taxes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Constitutional Limitation on Real Property Taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">8. Because of its lack of uniformity of application, the State Real Property Tax Act (L 1976, ch 349, &sect; 3) could not be considered to be a State tax without being in violation of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and sections 6&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***9]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and 11 of article I of the New York Constitution.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Parties -- Standing</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. The fact that the State Real Property Tax Act (L 1976, ch 349, &sect; 3) is a companion stand-by statute to the Emergency City and School District Relief Act (L 1976, ch 349, &sect; 2) and the cities and school districts will be permitted to take steps to implement it and have taxes levied under it only if and when the Court of Appeals declares the latter act to be unconstitutional, does not make the challenge to the Real Property Tax Act's constitutionality prospective, thus presenting no justiciable controversy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Declaratory Judgments -- Advisory Judgment</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">10. The fact that the court may be required to determine the rights of the parties upon the happening of a future event does not mean that the declaratory judgment will be merely advisory; where the future event is an act contemplated by one of the parties, it is assumed that the parties will act in accordance with the law and thus the court's determination will have the immediate and practical effect of influencing their conduct.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Constitutional Limitation on Real Property Taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">11. Chapter 484 of the Laws of 1976 (State&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***10]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Aid for School Districts Act), which assigns to the cost of current health and dental insurance coverage a period of probable usefulness of three years, resulting in the exclusion of those amounts from the tax limitations prescribed by section 10 of article VIII of the New York Constitution, is unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Taxation -- Constitutional Limitation on Real Property Taxes</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">12. The 2% tax limit for &quot;city purposes&quot; imposed by subdivision (b) of section 10 of article VIII of the New York Constitution should not be construed as excluding sums appropriated for educational purposes.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">13.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">14.

Section 50-e of the General Municipal Law is a general law, which is defined as one which in terms and in effect applies alike to all counties, all counties other than those wholly included within a city, all cities, all towns, or all villages (NY Const, art IX, &sect; 3, subd [d], par [1]).</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Prior Written Notice of Defective Condition</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3.  Section 50-e of the General Municipal Law allows municipalities to require notice of an unsafe condition as a condition precedent to a suit for damages caused thereby only with regard to a street, highway, bridge, culvert, sidewalk or crosswalk.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Local Laws</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Where the State has acted upon a subject and, in so acting, has evidenced a desire that its general laws should pre-empt the possibility of varying local laws, a local enactment may be said to be inconsistent with State law because it prohibits that which has been found acceptable under State law.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Municipal Corporations -- Prior Written Notice of Defective Condition -- Playing Fields</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">7. The general laws of the State require no prior written notice of an unsafe condition of a recreational playing field in order to bring an action against a town for injuries sustained there, and to the extent that a local law requires such notice, it is inconsistent with the general laws limiting requirements of prior notice of unsafe condition to those pertaining to streets, highways, bridges, culverts, sidewalks or crosswalks and is, therefore, unconstitutional.  </SPAN></P>

The husband also alleged that it was an unconstitutional impairment of a contract and that the wife's waiver of any such rights precluded her from maintaining the action. The lower court denied the motion and the husband appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the waiver in the stipulation only dealt with the matters discussed therein. The court held that it was illogical to assume that at the time the release was executed, the parties could have contemplated that a statute would be enacted several years later. The court also held that the statute was not unconstitutional because it did not violate the prohibition against impairment of contracts contained in the Federal Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Defendants appealed their conviction for possession of dangerous weapon and burglary, claiming that a handkerchief was not a dangerous instrument pursuant to &sect; 140.30 (3). The one defendant appealed his sentence, claiming a violation of due process because the trial court could not impose a stricter sentence on retrial. The court affirmed the conviction, holding that a handkerchief could be a dangerous instrument where it was used by defendants to bind and gag the victim, with the potential of causing great bodily harm or death. The court reduced the sentence, finding that the more severe sentence was not valid because the trial court improperly relied on the &quot;aggregate&quot; crimes charged, and there was no evidence of post-conviction conduct to validate the harsher sentence.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Repugnant Verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Inconsistency in a verdict does not invalidate it, since each count is treated separately; only repugnance in a verdict will invalidate it, and repugnance can only occur where the crimes contain identical counts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Repugnant Verdict</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. A finding that defendants did not cause the death of the victim or did not cause him physical injury in the commission of the burglary, is not repugnant to the finding that the handkerchief was a dangerous instrument, since the elements of the crimes for which defendants were acquitted were not identical to those involved in the crimes for which they were convicted.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Crimes -- Sentence -- Imposition of More Severe Sentence on Retrial</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">5.

<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">9. A sentence of 7 to 21 years imposed upon a defendant for the same crime to which his codefendant, upon resentence, could receive an indeterminate sentence of not more than 15 years, is unduly harsh and severe.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and the People cross-appealed a judgment from the Supreme Court, New York County (New York), which convicted defendant of robbery in the second degree. The jury found defendant guilty, as charged, of robbery in the first degree. The trial court vacated the jury verdict on the ground that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 160.15 was unconstitutional for placing the burden on defendant of proving an affirmative defense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant and an accomplice entered a barbershop and, at gunpoint, took cash, a television set, and some clothes from the shopkeeper. There was no evidence that defendant's pistol was fired during the robbery. The witness gave a positive identification; a week after the crime, defendant saw the shopkeeper, approached him, and apologized for the robbery. After the jury found defendant guilty of first degree robbery and before sentencing, defendant moved under N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law &sect;&sect; 330.30(1), 440.10(1), para. (h) to set aside the verdict, asserting that N.Y. Penal Law &sect; 160.15(4) was unconstitutional because it placed the burden of proof upon defendant to prove that the pistol displayed was unloaded or inoperable. The trial court agreed, set aside the verdict, and found defendant guilty of second degree robbery. Both sides appealed, and the court concluded that none of defendant's contentions merited disturbance of the judgment of conviction. The court rejected defendant's challenge of the constitutionality of &sect; 160.1(4) and held that the People's contention that the order of vacatur was improper was meritorious. Section 160.1(4) was not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court vacated defendant's sentence, reversed the order granting defendant's motion to set aside the verdict, reinstated the verdict of guilty of robbery in the first degree, and remanded the case to the trial court for resentencing. The court affirmed the judgment in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner hospital superintendent filed a proceeding under N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78 against respondents, county executive and board of review, after his employment was terminated. The Supreme Court, Erie County (New York) dismissed a cause of action alleging that his employment was terminated without a pre-termination hearing in violation of county regulations and ordered trials or hearings on the other causes of action. The parties appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superintendent argued, inter alia, that his dismissal violated N.Y. Civ. Serv. Law &sect; 75, that the county executive's failure to make a public statement explaining his termination stigmatized him and deprived him of liberty and property without due process, and that he was unconstitutionally discharged for partisan political reasons. The trial court dismissed a cause of action regarding pre-termination hearing and ordered trials or hearings on the other causes of action. The court modified the trial court's order by granting the motions to dismiss of the county executive and board of review as to these causes of action, affirmed the order as modified, and dismissed the petition. The superintendent had no right to a hearing under &sect; 75 because, as a holdover appointee, he was a temporary employee. Termination did not deprive him of a property interest because he did not have sufficient expectation of continued employment. Termination did not deprive him of a liberty interest because the reasons were communicated to him privately and were not stigmatic. His position was a policymaking position and thus was excepted from constitutional protections against patronage dismissals.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's order as to dismissal of the superintendent's cause of action alleging that county regulations entitled him to a pre-termination hearing. The court modified the order by granting the motions to dismiss of the county executive and board of review as to the causes of action under the New York Civil Service Law and the United States Constitution, and as modified affirmed the order and dismissed the petition.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Civil service -- termination of employment -- hearing -- dismissal for political purposes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Special Term properly determined that petitioner could be dismissed from his position as Superintendent of the Erie County E. J. Meyer Memorial Hospital without a hearing, since the Erie County Charter and the Erie County Administrative Code require a hearing for officers appointed for the term of the county executive, as was petitioner, only if removal is prior to the end of such term.  The term of the county executive ended prior to petitioner's removal, and petitioner was a holdover during the county executive's second term.  Accordingly, petitioner could be dismissed without a hearing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Petitioner is not entitled to the protection of section 75 of the Civil Service Law, since his appointment was for the term of the county executive and was not permanent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">3. Failure&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to issue a public statement explaining petitioner's termination did not deprive him of property or liberty without due process of law, since petitioner had insufficient expectation of continued employment to constitute a property interest and the failure to issue a statement cannot be held to infringe upon petitioner's liberty.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">4. Dismissal of petitioner for partisan political reasons was not improper, since the duties and term of petitioner's position indicate that his is a policymaking position for which there is no protection from partisan dismissal.  </SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant employer appealed from an order of the Supreme Court at Special Term, Albany County (New York), which granted a motion by plaintiff employee for summary judgment, reinstated him with back pay, enjoined the employer from disciplining the employee on the basis of alleged membership in the Ku Klux Klan, and declared unconstitutional and void a directive of defendant commissioner barring employees from membership in the Ku Klux Klan.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commissioner issued a directive that did not permit employees of the correctional institution to be members of the Ku Klux Klan. The employee was terminated after he refused to answer question regarding his alleged membership in the Ku Klux Klan. The employee commenced proceedings pursuant to N.Y. C.P.L.R. art. 78, later converted to an action for declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction order, against defendants. The supreme court granted the employee his requested relief upon his motion for summary judgment. Upon review, the court affirmed the supreme court. The court held that the directive infringed upon the employee's First Amendment right to freedom of association, and defendants did not meet their heavy burden to demonstrate that the directive and the inquiry into the employee's association was necessary to protect a legitimate state interest.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order and judgment of the supreme court.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">HEADNOTES </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c4">Prisons and prisoners -- dismissal of prison guard for membership in Ku Klux Klan -- freedom of association.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">1. Plaintiff, a correction officer with an unblemished record, was unlawfully dismissed from service because of his membership in the Ku Klux Klan.  The directive issued by defendant Commissioner of the Department of Correctional Services barring all employees from membership in the Ku Klux Klan, unconstitutionally infringes upon plaintiff's freedom of association as protected by the First Amendment. Defendant's directive establishes &quot;guilt by association&quot; alone which cannot be countenanced under&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  the First Amendment. The exclusion of all persons affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan provides no room for examination of the nature of an employee's, affiliation: what he believes to be the goals of the organization, to what extent he adheres to those goals, and to what extent the performance of his duties is affected.  The State has failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that membership in the Klan poses a real threat to its substantial interests in maintaining proper prison security and protecting inmates from uneven treatment.  The State has offered no evidence that inmate fear of the Klan would disrupt the delicate peace of the correctional facilities or that membership in the Klan would prevent the member from properly carrying out his functions as a correction officer.  Tranquility and elimination of discrimination in the prisons will come only through a thorough examination of the practices of all correction officers and by ferreting out those who violate departmental policy within the facilities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c10"><SPAN CLASS="c2">2. Before it can even lawfully inquire into an employee's associations the State must show that such inquiry is necessary to protect a legitimate State interest.  </SPAN></P>
