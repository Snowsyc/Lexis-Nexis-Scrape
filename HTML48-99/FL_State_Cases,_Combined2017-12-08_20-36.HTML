</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city enacted a rent control ordinance, Miami Beach, Fla., Ordinance 1791, after determining that a housing shortage existed which required regulation of rents. Thereafter, plaintiff lessors brought a declaratory judgment action, attacking the constitutionality of the ordinance. Summary judgment was entered for plaintiffs, with the trial court declaring the ordinance to be constitutionally invalid. Defendant appealed. In affirming, the court ruled that defendant did not have the power to enact the ordinance under its charter or under Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2. Landlord-tenant relationships were inherently reserved to the state and the ordinance impermissibly conflicted with laws regarding such relationships under Fla. Stat. ch. 83. Moreover, by delegating certain powers to a city rent administrator, the ordinance amounted to an unlawful delegation of legislative authority without providing objective guidelines and standards for enforcement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted certiorari and then quashed the district court's decision to affirm the judgment on the pleadings in favor of respondent board. Although the court agreed that Metropolitan Dade County, Fla., Code &sect; 32-65(c) was constitutional on its face, it recognized there could be an unconstitutional application of the ordinance as to petitioner private utility if petitioner had been deprived of a fair rate and thereby deprived of its property without due process of law. The court further noted that an arbitrary application of the ordinance's &quot;prudent investment theory,&quot; without regard to the final rate result as to its adequacy, would have been an unconstitutionally confiscatory action that deprived petitioner of a constitutionally guaranteed fair return on its investment, depending upon the factual showing. The court then concluded that remand was mandated where the required factual showing had not been considered by the trial court and no declaratory decree thereon had been reached.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owners brought an interlocutory appeal from the Circuit Court of Orange County (Florida), which denied their motion to dismiss plaintiffs' nuisance complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state officials filed a complaint seeking to abate or enjoin a public nuisance pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 823.05, 812.10, 60.05(1), and 398.14. The complaint stated that defendants' property was a gathering place for illegal drug use constituting a public nuisance. Defendant property owners filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, attacking the constitutionality of the statutes on vagueness grounds. The court reviewed the statutes in question which defined a public nuisance to include maintaining property that is used by illegal drug users and sellers. The court noted that nuisance cases must always be decided on their own facts and that writing a statute to specifically detail standards of conduct would be impossible. It was sufficient that the statute conveyed a definite warning as to proscribed conduct when measured by common understanding. The court noted, however, that an injunction issued to enjoin a nuisance would require more specific details.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the order of the trial court denying defendant property owners' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim because the allegations of the complaint contained specific factual allegations constituting a public nuisance. Statutes relied upon to define a public nuisance were also sufficiently specific to give the property owners notice of the proscribed conduct.</SPAN></P>

The appellate court held that there were no constitutional infirmities to the statute and affirmed the dismissal of the amended petitions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of a decision of the District Court of Appeal, First District (Florida), which held that Fla. Stat. ch. 924.07(8), authorizing appeals by the state from pretrial orders, was unconstitutional and which denied a petition for writ of certiorari on the ground that a pretrial order requiring a vision examination of witnesses did not depart from essential requirements of law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon the motion of defendants indicted for first degree murder, the trial court entered a pretrial order that witnesses used for identification were to be examined for visual acuity by a specified doctor prior to the trial. The state sought a reversal of the order by interlocutory appeal. The district court of appeal held that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and held Fla. Stat. ch. 924.07(8), authorizing appeals by the state from pretrial orders, unconstitutional. The state sought review. The court agreed with the district court of appeal and adopted a portion the decision. However, the only ground for defendants' motion in the underlying case was that the prosecution's case depended in whole or in part upon the identification of defendants by eyewitnesses, and the trial judge in entering the order departed from the essential requirements of law. The District Court of Appeal had treated the interlocutory appeal as a petition for a writ of common law certiorari and held that the trial court did not depart from the essential requirements of law. On review, the court thus quashed that portion of the decision denying the petition for writ of certiorari.</SPAN></P>

The district court of appeal lacked jurisdiction to entertain the appeal, but the trial judge departed from the essential requirements of law in entering the pretrial order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state officials challenged the legality of appellee city's bond election, arguing that it was held pursuant to the provisions of an unconstitutional procedure. The court first held that United States Supreme Court case law invalidated general purpose bond elections that were restricted to real property holders. Thus, the court held that a state law allowing property holders to veto a majority vote on a bond issuance by all electors constituted an election limited to property-owning voters and was thus unconstitutional. However, the court reasoned that the rest of the state's procedures for bond issuance elections were valid. Reviewing the record, the court held that the bond issue in the case at bar was valid because it did not apply the unconstitutional state law and was approved by a majority of all voters, including non-property owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment validating the issuance of appellee city's general purpose bonds was affirmed because the bond issuance election was not conducted using the constitutionally invalid portion of a state law regulating bond elections.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner challenged the judgment of the Criminal Court of Record of Dade County (Florida), which found him guilty of robbery and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The court had jurisdiction pursuant to Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 4(2) because the trial judge passed on the constitutionality of Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.250, concluding that it did not violate the U.S. Const. amend. VI, XIV.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant prisoner testified in his own behalf and called two defense witnesses. Pursuant to Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.250, appellee state was therefore entitled to make, and did make, the closing argument before the jury, over the objections of defense counsel. Appellant first asserted that Fla. R. Crim. P. 3.250 violated his due process rights because he had to forego his concluding argument because he called defense witnesses. The court held that a &quot;chilling effect&quot; was not shown because appellee's entitlement to the concluding argument was only one factor that influenced the jury and calling of witnesses was a strategic defensive choice. Second, appellant argued that he was denied equal protection under the U.S. Const. amend. XIV because the rule discriminated against defendants that call witnesses. The court found a rational basis for the rule because calling defense witnesses was an offensive tactic, giving appellee the defensive burden. Third, the right to open and close belonged to the prosecution as the party with the burden of proof in a criminal case and did not create psychological effects that diluted appellant's presumption of innocence, thereby violating due process.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant prisoner's conviction and sentence. The court concluded that the Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure regarding the accused as witness, was not violative of the United States Constitution and adequately balanced the prosecution and the defense by giving the defense the closing argument when the trial situation is weighted in favor of the prosecution.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent automobile dealers filed suit against petitioners, city and comptroller, attacking the validity of the municipal license tax, Tampa Comp. Code &sect; 21-50, and seeking to enjoin the collection of taxes levied. Petitioners challenged a decision of the district court of appeal that concluded that the tax was invalid and unconstitutional. In affirming, the state supreme court concluded that any tax not authorized by general law was necessarily invalid by virtue of the preemption clause of Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 1 (1968). Because the general laws of Florida did not authorize the tax in question, it was invalid. While the disputed tax was denominated as a license tax on retain merchants, it was measured by gross sales; thus, taxes were levied above a flat license tax. Fla. Stat.ch. 212.081 prohibited cities from imposing a sales tax, and Fla. Stat. ch. 167.43 did not provide authority for a license tax measured by gross sales. Thus, the tax was unconstitutional, and petitioners were enjoined from collecting such taxes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, candidate for President of the United States, sought a writ of mandamus or prohibition to require respondents to comply with petitioner's request to remove his name from list of candidates on Florida presidential primary ballot. Petitioner did not wish his name in the primary, contending his inability to campaign in Florida could cause harm to his national candidacy, that placing his name on the ballot in Florida was in violation of his right of privacy under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 2, Fla. Stat. Ann. and violated due process of law under Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 9, as well as such rights under U.S. Const. amend. I and XIV. The court upheld constitutionality of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 103.101(3)(a) and 103.101(4). The court held that privacy yielded to public interest when a citizen ran for national office. He became a public figure in sense expressed in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan decision. Freedom of expression upon public questions was secured by the U.S. Const. amend. I. Further, the people had a right to an orderly election. The statute was a valid exercise of police power. A candidate for national office could not pick and choose in which states he may be considered.</SPAN></P>

The court upheld the constitutionality of Florida primary election statute because a petitioner became a public figure and could not pick and choose in which states he may be considered on the primary ballot. Freedom of expression upon public questions was secured by the First Amendment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held that the statutory language lacked the definiteness and certainty required to establish standards that convey to the average citizen of common understanding a warning of which conduct was proscribed by the statute. The state appealed. The court reversed the dismissal of charges and held that the language of &sect; 877.03 was constitutional because it met the test of common understanding. The court held that not every detail is required to be set forth in such a statute so long as the prohibitive conduct was in such language that it was understood by the average citizen. The court held that the terms &quot;public decency&quot; and &quot;corrupt the public morals&quot; were terms of general understanding and should have put appellees on notice of what kind of behavior was proscribed.</SPAN></P>

The duty and judgment of a physician, the necessity and welfare of the patient, and the rights of both, could not be subjected to indefinite, uncertain, vague, or unreasonable legislation. The statutes were not so clearly and definitely expressed that an ordinary person could determine in advance whether his contemplated act was within or without the law, and the language was so vague and indefinite as to afford no fair warning as to what conduct might transgress them.

The court stated that whether equal protection has been denied depended on whether the legislative classification was reasonably expedient for the protection of the public safety, welfare, health or morals. The court held that Fla. Stat. ch. 193.461(4) (b) was a valid exercise of the state's police power and in no way deprived appellee of equal protection or due process of law.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants were charged under Fla. Stat. &sect; 800.01 for commission of a homosexual act, which carried a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Section 800.01 described the offense as &quot;the abominable and detestable crime against nature, either with mankind or with beast.&quot; The district court held that &sect; 800.01 was constitutional. Reversing the district court, the supreme court held that the statute was unconstitutionally vague and was void on its face. Section 800.01 did not meet the constitutional test that it inform the average person of common intelligence as to what was prohibited so that he need not speculate as to the statutory meaning. The statute was so vague that one would not have known what conduct would have violated its terms. In addition, the 20-year sentence was equal to one for manslaughter and would no doubt be a shocking revelation to one who did not have an understanding of the meaning of the statute. The court remanded for entry of a judgment of guilt of Fla. Stat. &sect; 800.02, a misdemeanor and for imposition of a sentence within the six months maximum sentence under &sect; 800.02.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner then filed for writ of prohibition to prohibit respondent from trying the criminal charges filed against petitioner and commanding respondent to grant petitioner's motion for discharge. The proceedings were then transferred, and the court issued a rule nisi to which respondent filed a return. Upon review, the court noted petitioner was not in the position of a confined prisoner; thus the statute was constitutional as applied to him. Consequently, petitioner's motions should have been granted, and the return to the rule nisi did not present a defense.

Appellees argued that this statute's second exception of the second clause was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, such that an average person was not informed of the prohibited conduct. The trial courts agreed and entered judgments for them. Appellants challenged those judgments, and the court consolidated their cases for review. Appellants argued that the contested provision, when read in conjunction with the proceeding language, is sufficiently clear and understandable within its context. Appellants asserted the principle of ejusdem generis applied to cure any vagueness or overbreadth. The court held for appellees that the second exception of the second clause of ch. 790.23(2) failed to meet the constitutional test of clarity. The court affirmed the trial courts' judgments insofar as they had invalidated that portion of the statute, but left the rest of the law intact. The court remanded the cases for further consideration consistent with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the statute and, on review, the court affirmed the conviction, finding the statute was neither vague nor overbroad and did not violate U.S. Const. amends. I and XIV and the Declaration of Rights of the State of Florida. The court determined that the words &quot;lewd&quot; and &quot;lascivious&quot; were in common use and the definitions indicated with reasonable certainty the character of acts and conduct which the legislature intended to prohibit and punish by the enactment of the statute, so that a person of ordinary understanding would know what conduct was prohibited. The court concluded that sexual intercourse between a husband and wife in the presence of a child under 14 years of age for the purpose of demonstrating to such child the method of procreation of the human race was a lewd and lascivious act in violation of ch. 800.04.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant water company sought to have 1967 Fla. Laws ch. 67-1815, concerning regulation of water rates, declared unconstitutional on its face as class legislation because it was not applicable to other water companies and violated appellant's right to equal protection under the law. The trial court ruled that the statute was constitutional and that county commissioners had independent authority to establish rates and regulate all utilities in the county, including municipalities such as appellee town. On direct appeal, the court reversed, stating that the trial court had improperly relied on 1967 Fla. Laws ch. 67-1815. A new statute that was a total revision of the Water and Sewer System Regulatory Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 367.011(4) (1971), superseded all prior laws on the subject. Therefore, the Public Service Commission had jurisdiction over all utility rates in the county, and local authorities were without authority to regulate or to fix rates of appellant water company.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court accepted jurisdiction to rectify a mistake in re-transferring the action to the district court involved. Pursuant to Fla. Const. art.

The court found that as applied to the facts of defendant's alleged disorderly conduct in the case, Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 877.03 was unconstitutional. While it appeared that there was an angry altercation between defendant and a female student about the latter ripping down a sign defendant had just posted, no commotion ensued creating a breach of the peace. No disciplinary action was found necessary by the school authorities. Defendant's alleged disorderly conduct did not reach proportions that violated &sect; 877.03.

III, &sect; 6 in that the title of the act did not give fair notice of the intent to legislate on the subject of filing fees in civil actions, noting that where the general subject of creating and funding a law library was expressed in the act, the means and instrumentalities for effecting that subject matter did not need to be stated in the title. The appellate court further found that the portion of the filing fee payable to the law library was not an unconstitutional tax, noting that the law library fulfilled an important and growing need and that its costs was appropriately assessed against those who made use of the state's court system. However, the appellate court then reversed in part, finding that the proper amount of the fee to be allocated had been miscalculated and ordering a new fee allocation in line with the language of Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner, Comptroller for the State of Florida, argued that an appropriations act, 1971 Fla. Laws ch. 357, &sect; 2, improperly transferred certain duties from petitioner's department to respondent Department of General Services (DGS) in violation of Fla. Const. amend. art. III, &sect; 12, which barred appropriations from dealing with any other subject, unless the subject and appropriations were interdependent. The court agreed, ruling that the transfer -- of supervision and control of a data processing division -- from petitioner to respondent DGS was not so interwoven with the appropriation of funds to the data division so as to justify its inclusion in the act. Thus, the court held that the transfer should be expunged from the act, as the appropriate vehicle for making the transfer would be by general law, and not by using the hidden recesses of an appropriations act whose title allegedly failed fully to express the act's purpose. Thus, monies appropriated to respondent DGS for the &quot;transferred&quot; data division must be redirected back to petitioner's budget, the court concluded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged a declaratory judgment of the Circuit Court of Duval County, (Florida), which held that appellant's application of 1970 Fla. Laws ch. 70-134, was unconstitutional under Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 (1968). Appellees were interested parties from the county who had successfully challenged below the imposition of small claims court fees and county judges' court fees by appellants as an improper, unconstitutional practice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, persons who appeared before appellants, a county small claims court and the county judges, had challenged the constitutionality of the fees imposed by the small claims court and by its judges. Appellees filed a declaratory action contending appellant's actions with regard to imposition of small claims court fees and county judges' court fees were unconstitutional. The trial court held for the appellees finding that appellant was not authorized under the laws to impose fees which it did. Appellants contended that Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6 (1968) placed the reader on notice that it dealt with clerks of circuit courts and &quot;other courts&quot; which included the small claims courts. The court, however, found that &quot;other courts&quot; were the civil court and the county court, not the small claims court. The court further found that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 28.231 gave no notice of its applicability to county judges or small claims courts. The trial court judgment for the appellees was affirmed because appellant's contention that 1970 Fla. Laws ch. 70-134 applied to it were unconstitutional and violative of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court declaratory judgment for the appellees, parties who had gone before the appellants, a county court and its county judges. The court held that the contested statutes upon which appellants' fees were based was unconstitutional because of the statute's failure to provide any notice of applicability to the appellants, the county judges or the small claims court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant insureds were involved in an automobile accident with a woman whose insurance company was insolvent. Appellants asserted that they were entitled to uninsured motor vehicle coverage under their insurance policy with appellee insurer. Furthermore, appellants asserted that Fla. Stat. &sect; 627.0851(3) was unconstitutional because it impaired and limited appellants' ability to contract for one year and because it denied due process and equal protection of the law. The court interpreted &sect; 627.0851(3) to mean that appellants were not bound by the one-year provision, but could negotiate contractually for conditions more favorable to themselves. The statute set a minimum standard of protection applicable where the contract was silent on the subject, while at the same time permitting the insured to bargain for more favorable terms and conditions. The court also explained that &sect; 627.0851(3) eliminated any &quot;classification&quot; of persons by making the statute subject to the terms and conditions of the insurance contract. Consequently, appellants' equal protection argument failed. The statute was a valid exercise of the power of the state to regulate contracts of insurance.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 847.011.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee, State of Florida, filed a complaint with the trial court against appellants, adult bookstore owners. Appellee first requested, under Fla. Stat. ch. 847.011, and obtained from the court a temporary injunction against appellants from selling obscene or pornographic materials. Appellee next requested and obtained permanent injunctions which halted sales and closed appellants' store as a nuisance. Appellants defended against those injunctions by arguing that ch. 847.011 was unconstitutional on its face and as applied against them. The trial court rejected both contentions. Appellants challenged those decisions. The court ruled that ch. 847.011 was facially constitutional. The court, however, found that issuance of both injunctions was constitutionally defective because of the invalid standard of obscenity applied. Their premise of Fla. Stat. ch. 847.011(10) failed to consider an applicable subsequent court decision. The court held the temporary injunction invalid because it was a defective blanket prohibition. The court held the permanent injunction invalid because it improperly relied upon a nuisance theory. The court dissolved the injunctions and remanded the matter.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dissolved the permanent injunctions imposed by the trial court for appellee, State of Florida, against appellants, adult bookstore owners, because both the blanket prohibition against sales of adult materials and the permanent store closure as a nuisance were unconstitutional applications of the valid state statute.

Stat. ch. 847.031.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, an outdoor theater owner, was convicted by jury of admitting a minor to an exhibition of motion pictures harmful to minors in violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 847.013. The court affirmed the conviction. The court rejected appellant's argument that ch. 847.013 was unconstitutional because it did not provide for a adversary hearing to determine probable cause for arrest and seizure. In doing so, the court distinguished censures proceedings which required an evidentiary hearing from arrests under criminal statutes, like ch. 847.013, that provided for arrests upon a valid warrant. The court also rejected appellant's argument that ch. 847.013 was unconstitutional because it did not provide for immediate appellate review of what was harmful to minors. Again, the court distinguished this criminal statute from censure proceedings where the materials were seized, noting that appellant was free to obtain another copy of the films and show them to adults. Finally, the court found that the trial court correctly applied the community, rather than the national, standard for determining what was &quot;suitable for minors,&quot; noting that raising children was a local or community concern.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's conviction for knowingly admitting a minor to motion pictures harmful to minors because the law prohibiting such conduct only needed to provide same procedural safeguards as those applied to any other criminal offense, and the trial court appropriately imposed the community standard for determining whether the motion pictures were harmful.</SPAN></P>

The court found that the final judgment arose out of a prior adversary hearing held in advance of a judicial determination of obscenity as to specifically identified publications. The court held that this procedure was constitutionally sound. The court further found that examination of the transcript revealed that the people testifying as to the exhibits and their relation to the Roth-Memoirs tests represented a wide variety of experiences relating to contemporary community standards both in the county having jurisdiction over appellant and across the country. The court held, therefore, that the evidence supported the judgment of the lower court. The court reserved judgment, however, upon a publication that had been misplaced and was not included in the materials before the court.</SPAN></P>

Appellant filed a complaint with the trial court which sought to enjoin appellees, Duval County Sheriff and Florida Attorney General, from arresting her and to have ch. 800.03 declared unconstitutional. Appellant claimed the statute was facially invalid because of its vagueness. Appellant argued that because her work conduct was expressive speech protected by U.S. Const. amend. I, the law was an unconstitutional restriction upon this right, and therefore, appellees' enforcement had to be enjoined. The court rendered judgment for appellees on all grounds. Appellant challenged that decision. The court held the statute was not unconstitutionally vague such that an average person could not learn of the prohibited conduct. The court ruled that this law, as applied to appellant's conduct, was not unconstitutional because it reasonably would apply to her work activity. The court found that, rather than engaging in protected expressive speech, appellant's actions constituted prohibited conduct. The court affirmed the trial court judgment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was arrested pursuant to a warrant issued by a municipal court clerk. He contested his arrest on the grounds that Fla. Stat. ch. 168.04 (1967) and City of Tampa, Fla., Charter &sect;&sect; 495, 160.1, which authorized the clerk to issue arrest warrants, violated the U.S. Const. amends. IV, XIV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 (1968). The intermediate appellate court affirmed, and appellant sought further review. The court affirmed, rejecting appellant's contention that the clerk could not determine probable cause because he was not a judicial officer. The determination of probable cause for an arrest was not confined to strictly judicial officers, as it was only a quasi-judicial function. Arrest warrant procedure required a neutral and detached magistrate to draw requisite inferences from facts which lead to the complaint. The court held that the clerk and deputy clerks of the municipal court were neutral and detached &quot;magistrates,&quot; unconnected with law enforcement, for the purpose of issuing arrest warrants within the requirements of the U.S. Const. amends. IV, XIV and Fla. Const. art. I, &sect; 12 (1968).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant drivers challenged a decision from the Circuit Court of Dade County (Florida), which granted the motion for summary judgment filed by appellees, state insurance commissioner and public officials. Appellants had sued appellees alleging they had been unconstitutionally deprived of their rights in connection with the suspension of their driving credentials under the Florida Financial Responsibility Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 324.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant drivers represented a class of people whose motor vehicle driving and registration licenses were suspended for failing to post security to protect other victims of accidents in which they were involved, or, in the alternative, to obtain releases from them, and failing to obtain liability insurance. The trial judge granted the motion for summary judgment filed by appellees, state insurance commissioner and public officials, after finding no genuine issue of material fact and concluding that appellants' contentions were controlled by a decision of the state supreme court. The state supreme court reversed and remanded the trial judge's order granting appellees' motion for summary judgment. The state supreme court held that a United States Supreme Court decision modified the prior state supreme court decision. Thus, the state supreme court concluded, before the state could deprive appellants and similar drivers of their driver's licenses and vehicle registrations, the state had to provide a forum for the determination of the question of whether there was a reasonable possibility of a judgment being rendered against them as a result of accidents.</SPAN></P>

Appellee filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and a counterclaim asserting that appellee's charter was granted prior to the passage of Chapter 470, and thus its right of contract could not be impaired by legislation under that Chapter. The circuit court ruled in favor of appellee and appellant State Board challenged the order. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the funeral directing business was sufficiently involved with the public interest to justify legislative regulation, and thus appellee's constitutional challenges were without merit.

The court held that, instead of dismissing the proceeding without prejudice in order for relator to apply to the appropriate district court of appeal, it had the authority under Fla. Const. art.

Stating that the denial of alimony on ground of adultery remained a proper exercise of the police power of the state, the court held that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 61.08 (1967) was constitutional, and affirmed the decree. The court scoffed at the social science appellant offered as authority for the proposition that mores had so changed that a wife's adultery was no longer a valid reason to deny her alimony. The court explained that monogamy elevated humans above baboons, noted that there was no alimony at common law, and that alimony was a matter of legislative grace extended not at all to the male of the species. The court held that the restriction placed on this dispensation was only reasonably expedient for the protection of the public morals. As such, it was not an affront to equal protection or due process of the laws. The court perceived no error in the trial court's factual findings, but affirmed the custody award without prejudice to appellant's ability to seek a reevaluation of it.</SPAN></P>

VII, &sect;&sect; 9, 10 (1968), and that the leased property was not a &quot;port facility&quot; as defined in Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 315.02(6) and could not be leased under Fla. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee port authority leased part of a publicly owned island to appellee lessee for a private commercial development. Holding that appellee port authority had the power to lease the property to a private developer, and that the lease did not involve the unconstitutional extension of public credit, the court affirmed the judgment. The court held that the leased property was a &quot;port facility&quot; that appellee port authority had the power under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 315.03(9) to dispose of. The court noted that the initial resolution authorizing the purchase of the island characterized the island in terms embraced by the definition of a &quot;port facility&quot; in Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 315.02(6), and the uses put to the island since that time were consistent with that definition. The court then held that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 315.03(9), (14), 315.14, and 315.15, and 1959 Fla. Laws ch. 1701(21)(N), provided ample authority for the lease. Finally, the court found that the lease did not expose appellee port authority to any credit risk, and did not violate the constitutional prohibition against the lending of the credit of the state for a private purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court granted a rule nisi in prohibition to prevent petitioner's trial due to speedy trial violations. An information that charged petitioner with robbery was filed in November 1969. Petitioner was arrested and incarcerated in February 1970. Following a series of demands for speedy trial, petitioner's trial was set for October 1970. The court held that under the clear prohibitions of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 915.01(1)(1969), petitioner should have been brought to trial at or before the third term of court after the date he was first committed. The court rejected respondent judge's argument that the provisions of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 915 were unconstitutional because of the varying terms of court in the state's criminal courts, which ranged from two months to six months. The court held that respondent lacked standing to complain of the lack of equal protection when the jurisdiction of the court of record was two months, the shortest term. Noting that it was unfortunate that a defendant would be discharged due to the severe congestion of the criminal courts, despite efforts of the state and the judge, the court discharged petitioner.</SPAN></P>

The relators contended that the provision of the statute that allowed a felony case pending in the criminal court of record to be transferred to the circuit court for trial violated Fla. Const. art.

The court held that the Constitution did not prohibit the legislature from conferring upon the circuit courts jurisdiction concurrent with that of other courts of a matter that was not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the other court. Moreover, the court determined that Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 2 contained neither an express nor an implied prohibition against the statute. Thus, the court concluded that 1971 Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners were arrested and released on bond on June 24, 1970. Their arrest occurred during a judicial term, which began June 9, 1970, and ended August 10, 1970. Three subsequent judicial terms began on August 11, 1970, October 13, 1970, and December 8, 1970. On December 14, 1970, during the fourth term since petitioners were arrested, they moved for discharge of the criminal case against them under Fla. Stat. &sect; 915.01(2). Respondent trial judge denied the motion on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional. Petitioners sought a writ of mandamus ordering respondent to dismiss the charges or to show cause why he had not done so. The supreme court did not issue the writ because ch. 915.01(2) required that petitioners be brought to trial at or before the third full term after the date they were first committed. The first term was not a full term, so they were not entitled to discharge under ch. 915.01(2) until the fourth term that began on December 8, 1970, ended. Thus, because petitioners sought their release prematurely, the court properly denied their motion, and the issue of the statute's constitutionality was not properly before the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The writ of mandamus was denied because the trial court properly denied petitioners' motion to dismiss the charges filed against them.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">It became known to appellant state that appellees, racing tracks and officers, contributed to the political campaign of the former governor in two years. Appellant filed suit alleging violation of Fla. Stat. ch. 99.161 (1965). The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court held that the findings that ch. 99.161 was unconstitutional and that Fla. Stat. ch. 104.27(4) was null and void were erroneous. There was no denial of equal protection because ch. 99.161 did not cover jai alai fronton permit holders in that these permit holders were prohibited from making contributions under Fla. Stat. ch. 550.07. However, equal protection was denied because the four-year statute of limitations in Fla. Stat. ch. 99.161(13) applied only to horse track permit holders. Jai alai fronton permit holders were governed by the general one-year limitations period in Fla. Stat. Ch. 95.11(7)(a). Therefore, finding that ch. 95.11(7)(a) came into effect, the court held that the complaint was barred.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order was affirmed in part and reversed in part and the dismissal of the complaint charging violation of the campaign contribution statute was sustained, as horse and dog track permit holders were not denied equal protection in that jai alai fronton permit holders were barred under a separate statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee corporation sued on the validity of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 550.081, for the second time. The statute withdrew from the state racing commission its discretionary power to fix each year the racing dates among the three horse racing tracks located in certain counties. Instead, it set out a formula for the fixing of dates using the tax revenues for the preceding year to allocate the right to choose to operate during the racing period of choice. Appellant corporation, since the time of the enactment of the statute, had the right to and had selected the most desirable racing dates. The trial court declared the statute unconstitutional on due process and equal protection grounds. Appellant and another sought review, arguing, among other things, res judicata. The record contained evidence sufficient to support the finding that appellee had proven the allegations of its complaint and that the changed conditions eliminated the decision of the first suit from operating as an estoppel. Additionally, the statute had the effect of denying to appellee equal protection and due process of law. The other contentions were considered, but none required reversal and the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The supreme court found no error in the judgment that declared unconstitutional a state statute concerning the fixing of racing dates among three racing tracks in certain counties.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of decision which refused to accord full faith and credit under U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1, to an extraterritorial punitive damage award obtained against appellee in an action to cancel a franchise contract for false and malicious misrepresentations. The court reversed the denial of full faith and credit, concluding that the exception to full faith and credit was inapplicable to the punitive damage award because the award was not penal in nature, but instead was general common law liability for false misrepresentations on appellee's part. The court held that enforcement of such an award did not violate the principle that penal laws of one state were not enforceable in another. The test for whether a law was penal in the strict sense was whether the wrong sought to be redressed, was a wrong to the public or a wrong to the individual. The court explained that appellee was punished for the purpose of reparation to those aggrieved by his offense. The court affirmed a compensatory award, concluding that appellee's cross-appeal was without merit where he did not assign errors contesting punitive damages or raise a notice issue below.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the conclusion of a public hearing, appellee adopted an ordinance that increased water and sewer rates and issued revenue bonds as a means of paying for the construction of a new sanitary sewerage collection system. The new rates were different as to whether the person charged was a single family home dweller, apartment dweller, or other user. Appellants challenged the validity of the ordinance, and the trial court upheld it. Appellants sought review, and the court affirmed. The court held it was not error for appellee to adopt the ordinance at the same public meeting conducted for the purpose of discussing the proposed ordinance. Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 184.09(3) did not required the adoption of sewer rates at a later and separate meeting. The ordinance fixing rates could be enacted at any time after closing the public hearing or at the same meeting. The court also held that the assessment of different rates to different types of dwellers was not in violation of due process and equal protection because the classifications were not unreasonable, arbitrary or in conflict with the law.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff tenants' association sued defendant apartment complex over a disputed tract of land covered by a lake. The dispute revolved around a restrictive clause contained in the water-bottom deed. A trial court found that the use of the lake by defendant's tenants unreasonably interfered with the right of other proprietors and should have been enjoined. The trial court found that defendant had knowledge of the restrictive clause and could not disavow it. On appeal, defendant argued that it had an inalienable right to use all of its properties. To deny that right was to deny defendant equal protection of the law. The court held that the restrictive clause ran with the land because defendant acquired the land with notice of the restriction. It was the intent and purpose of the conveyance and the restrictive clause to give defendant control of the use of the lake, but not the land. Therefore, the court held that defendant was bound by the clause. The district court's decision was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner extermination companies were licensed to engage in pest control by Fla. Stat. ch. 482. Petitioners were all located in municipalities outside the jurisdiction of respondent municipal authorities. Pursuant to general occupational license ordinances, respondents required petitioners to pay a fee for their exterminators' licenses. In declaratory judgment actions initiated by petitioners, the trial court held that respondents could not require petitioners to obtain such licenses. The district court reversed. On appeal, the court stated that, under Fla. Stat. ch. 482.081, occupational licenses were to be issued by respondents only after petitioners had a license for each business location. The temporary presence of a fumigation tent or a spraying truck within a municipality did not lay a predicate for respondent municipality to demand that an occupational license be purchased. The court found that the transactions sought to be licensed contributed to the completion of tasks under contract. By attempting to require licenses from petitioners, respondents were levying an impermissible tax. Therefore, the decision was quashed and the consolidated cases were remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1969, appellee tax collector and appellee tax assessor wrote letters notifying appellant municipalities in their county of the requirements of 1969 Fla. Laws ch. 69-54, which provided for the assessment and collection of all ad valorem taxes levied by appellants to be assessed and collected by appellees. Included with these letters were contracts to be executed by each municipality, which provided for a fee of one percent of all taxes collected to be paid to appellees as compensation. When appellants balked at the terms, appellees filed a declaratory judgment action to determine their rights. Both sides argued that the law was unconstitutional. After the trial court upheld the constitutionality of the statute, appellants lodged a direct interlocutory appeal. The court affirmed, holding that appellants failed to demonstrate that ch. 69-54 was unconstitutional. The court construed the statute to allow appellees to be compensated for services rendered for appellants above and beyond the costs and expenses already incurred in executing such functions for the county; nor did the transfer of functions from municipal offices to county offices violate Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Upon request for an advisory opinion by the Governor, the court undertook the interpretation of Fla. Const. art. VII, &sect; 5 to determine its applicability to corporations. The court found that, when viewed in the light of its history, the constitutional provision was understood to prohibit any income tax whatsoever in the state, whether it was sought to be imposed against a natural person or a corporation. The use of the terms &quot;residents&quot; and &quot;citizens&quot; in the provision were entirely in accord with this understanding because these terms had been held more often than not to apply to corporations as well as to natural persons. In the light of the history of and the circumstances under which Fla. Const. Art VII, &sect; 5 was adopted, and the fact that, except for the privileges and immunities clauses of the U.S. Const. amend. XIV and U.S. Const. art. IV, &sect; 2, it was held almost without exception that a corporation was a citizen or resident within the meaning of statutes applicable thereto, the court concluded that the framers and adopters of the provision intended that corporations as well as natural persons were protected from the imposition of income tax.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Corporations were protected from the imposition of income tax under the Florida State Constitution because corporations were regularly considered citizens or residents within the meaning of state statutes.</SPAN></P>

An investigation was conducted as to petitioner's mental condition and ability to stand trial, as authorized by Fla. Stat. ch. 917.01. An order finding petitioner incompetent to stand trial and committing him to the Florida State Hospital was entered by the trial court. Petitioner filed a writ of habeas corpus. Petitioner argued that, insofar as ch. 917.01 authorized the commitment, automatically, of any insane accused person to a mental institution without a judicial determination that he was dangerous to himself or others, was a denial of equal protection. Under other Florida statutes, one adjudged to be mentally incompetent in civil proceedings could be released to the care, custody, and control of any responsible person who undertook to assume the care and maintenance of the incompetent. The court clarified that the equal protection clause is violated only when the classification made by an act is arbitrary and unreasonable. The court discharged the writ because the interest of the State of Florida in safekeeping those accused of crimes until trials occur was a valid and reasonable basis for the classification.</SPAN></P>

The trial court granted such an injunction, finding that the statute was not a denial of due process but that it was a denial of equal protection. Defendant appealed and the court affirmed the holding regarding due process but reversed the holding as to equal protection. The statute was not an unconstitutional taking of property without due process because the moratorium operated prospectively only. It prohibited future rate increases but it did not roll back rates. There was no denial of equal protection because it applied to all insurance companies equally, effectively freezing whatever rates they had in effect on a certain date. Prior to the effective date the insurance companies were free to set whatever rates they wanted so no one was disadvantaged relative to another company by the statute.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed the decision from the Fourth District Court of Appeal (Florida) quashing the decision of the circuit court to affirm the judgment of the court of record that had convicted defendant of conspiracy to commit assault and battery after defendant had been charged with conspiracy with intent to commit murder in the first degree.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with conspiracy with intent to commit murder in the first degree, but the court of record convicted him of the lesser-included offense of conspiracy to commit assault and battery. The circuit court affirmed the court of record's judgment, but the district court of appeal quashed the circuit court's decision. The court quashed the district court of appeal's decision and reinstated the circuit court's decision. The court defined a lesser-included offense as one which might or might not be included in the offense charged depending on the accusatory pleading and the evidence. The crime of which defendant was convicted was not necessarily an included offense of the crime with which defendant was charged. The information, however, was sufficient to advise defendant of the nature of the accusation against him because it alleged conspiracy. Thus, the court of record's error was harmless.</SPAN></P>

Appellants, State of Florida's Attorney General, Board of Business Regulation, and State of Florida Department of Business Regulation, assessed a tax deficiency against appellee under Fla.

Appellants challenged the ruling, and the court held that the statute's heading gave fair notice to the public of its contents, and, therefore, appellee should have been aware of it. The court also determined that the statute did not violate Fla. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of possession of LSD in violation of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 404.02(1). Defendant appealed on the grounds that &sect; 404.02(1) was not drafted with determinative meaning and reasonably specific language such that persons were advised of its prohibitions. The court remanded with instructions. When initially drafted, &sect; 404.02(1) prohibited the delivery of barbiturates or central nervous system stimulants, which were the illegal drugs most commonly used at the time. The legislature later amended the law to include &quot;other drugs controlled by law.&quot; At that time, LSD was listed in the definitions section as a hallucinogenic drug which was covered by the Florida Drug Abuse Law. As a general rule, in construing a statute as to ascertain the legislature's intent, the statute was to be construed as a whole or in its entirety, and the legislative intent gathered from the entire statute rather than from any one part thereof. Under this principle of statutory interpretation, it was reasonable to infer that the legislature intended to include LSD and other defined substances within the prohibition of delivery or possession of &quot;other drugs controlled by law.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Defendants were found in the woods between the late hours and the early morning hours on horseback with lights and loaded shotguns. Defendants testified that they were looking for trespassers. On appeal, the circuit court held that ch. 372.99 was valid and that the trial court properly instructed the jury on the statutory presumption in ch. 372.99(2). Defendants sought review. The supreme court found that the authorities cited in support of the contention that the jury should not have been instructed on the presumption because evidence in explanation was offered were inapplicable. The trial court correctly charged the jury in the language of the statute. Defendants also contended that the statutory presumption was unconstitutional under certain case law.

The trial court entered summary final judgment in favor of defendants, and plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court disagreed with plaintiffs that &sect; 767.04 was unconstitutional. The statute did not take away a right of redress for injury; rather, it only restricted liability under certain circumstances. The court further held that under &sect; 767.04 a factual determination had to be made whether the &quot;Bad Dog&quot; sign as posted was in a prominent place and easily readable so as to give actual notice of the risk of bite.

Admin. Code Ann. r. 7 I-4. The lower court upheld the constitutionality of the Order and approved the manner in which it was currently applied. On appeal, the court agreed that the Order was constitutional as actually applied, even though it did not embrace the Zellwood area. There was a clear distinction between that area and the southern region of the state. The four producing areas in the southern region were closely related geographically and had similar conditions, which permitted treatment of the region as a single unit. The Zellwood area had its own conditions and growing seasons. Furthermore, the southern region crops were marketed much earlier than the Zellwood crops. These distinctions were reasonable and any spillover benefit from advertising was merely incidental. The court then found that the legislature did not improperly delegate its power to tax because that power could be exercised through the agriculture commission, a subordinate agency. Finding the remaining contentions to be without merit, the court affirmed the judgment.</SPAN></P>

The trial court found that the statute was constitutional and convicted defendants of the crime of vagrancy. Defendants appealed. The supreme court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because the vagrancy law met the tests of certainty and was the type of vagrancy law which had been consistently upheld as a necessary regulation for the deterrence of vagabondage, the prevention of crimes, and to keep able bodied people from becoming public charges or burdens on their families.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed two suits questioning the assessment of real property taxes by the county and city for the year 1968. The suits were consolidated. Plaintiff contended that the assessments by defendants were unlawful because the property involved was exempt from taxation under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 192.06(14) (1967). Defendants argued that the statute was unconstitutional in that it attempted to grant tax exemptions to homes for the aged owned by religious organizations and operated primarily for religious purposes. Defendant also urged that the statute violated the establishment of religion as contained in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, U.S. Const. amend. I. The trial court declared the property of plaintiff to be exempt from all ad valorem taxation by the city and county and enjoined defendants from collecting the taxes or from selling the land because of any alleged delinquency. Defendants appealed. The court affirmed the decision of the trial court, finding that organizations operating homes for the aged, such as plaintiff's, could qualify for a tax exemption even if it was owned by a religious denomination or when their own members resided therein.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Two candidates for judge paid a qualifying fee based on the salary set by county ordinance. Thereafter, legislation increased the salary in counties with a population of more than 4,000, but this was simultaneously repealed as it related to counties with a population of less than 9,000. A third candidate then paid a fee based on the lower salary, but petitioner relator based his fee on the higher one. Subsequently, the ordinance was re-adopted. Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking to compel respondent state secretary to declare him the only qualified candidate and nominee for his party. He further sought to prohibit respondent from placing the other candidates on the ballot. The court declined to aid petitioner in his plan to belatedly take advantage of confusion in the fee amount. He waited until 21 days after the qualifying deadline to file suit, less than a month before the election. To interfere with the election process at this late date would have resulted in confusion and injuriously affected the rights of third persons. Finding that petitioner failed to show that he had a clear legal right, the writ was quashed and the cause dismissed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Criminal defendants, convicted of felonies, filed motions to set bail pending prosecution of their appeals. A trial court denied bail pending appeal pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 903.131 because both defendants had previously been convicted of felonies. On appeal, defendants argued that the statute violated the state and federal constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws and violated equal protection requirements. Defendants also asserted that the statute violated the separation of powers clause in Fla. Const. art. II, &sect; 3, and the excessive bail prohibition of U.S. Const. amend. VIII. Release on bail pending appeal or review of a conviction normally rested within the trial court's discretion. Therefore, the separation of powers was not violated. Release on bail after conviction was not an absolute right under the federal constitution. However, the court held that the statute was invalid because it was ex post facto in its effect upon defendants. Defendants' first felony convictions occurred before the effective date of the statute and the second afterwards. Application of the statute increased defendants' punishment. The order was quashed and the cause remanded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee citizen filed a petition to amend the state constitution with appellant secretary of state.

The trial court held that the petition that proposed the amendment complied with Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 3 and should be submitted to the voters if it had the required number of electors' signatures. On appeal, the court determined that amendment and revision denoted entirely different things as used in Fla. Const. art. XI. The court reasoned that an amendment could be made without changes to the rest of the constitution but that when more than one section of the constitution was to be amended, it was called a revision. The court thought that the proposed amendment to provide for a unicameral legislature would radically alter the whole pattern of government in the state and tear apart the whole fabric of the constitution. Thus, the court concluded that such a change had to be initiated by calling a constitutional convention to consider a revision of the entire constitution under Fla. Const. art.

After a trial court granted a temporary injunction, appellant purportedly removed the case to federal court. A federal judge later entered an order for remand, stating that the burden was upon appellant to show that removal to federal court was effected prior to the injunction hearing and appellant failed to meet this burden. Therefore, the record failed to show that the trial court did not have jurisdiction. The trial court found appellant and its officers guilty of contempt for violating the injunction. The court reversed the decision. Afterwards, the trial court entered its rule nisi, alleging that appellant willfully violated the injunction. The court found that appellant could not challenge the validity of the injunction because it failed to seek judicial review and did not have standing. Teachers, as employees of the government, had no right to strike in order to coerce a change in compensation or conditions of employment. The temporary injunction was appropriate even in the absence of violence or a threat of violence. The judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The act set out a program of underwriting and subsidizing the development or expansion of packaging, dispensing, distributing, and the marketing of techniques, materials and the sale and purchase of processed orange products. The trial court adjudged that the act was unconstitutional and that the marketing order was invalid because of the delegation of power to an administrative agency that was exclusively vested in the legislature by the state constitution. Appellant state agency, charged with administration of the act, brought a direct appeal. The court reversed the trial court's judgment and held that the act and the marketing order were constitutionally valid because they did not create an improper delegation of legislative power.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's landing shrimp without a permit conviction and the denial of his motion to suppress evidence taken after the warrantless search of his vessel. The requirement that a shrimp landing permit applicant agree to allow conservation officers to board his vessel at any time to determine whether it contained a valid permit did not violate constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondents, members of the personnel board of a city, attempted to remove petitioners from their positions as city firemen. Petitioners were reinstated by order of the trial court. Further litigation commenced involving the amount of &quot;reasonable attorney's fees&quot; to be awarded to the attorneys for petitioners under 1951 Fla. Laws ch. 51-27735. The district court held that failure to include the right to attorney's fees made the statute unconstitutional, and respondents appealed. The court held that there was no fundamental error and that the district court improperly considered the constitutionality of the statute. Further, the court ruled that the fees awarded by the trial court was reasonable and was awarded at the direction of the district court. Thus, the court quashed the decision and opinion of the district court and remanded the cause to the district court with further directions to remand the cause to the trial court for the purpose of reinstating the judgment granting the attorney's fees.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a circuit court judge, intended to qualify for the office of Justice of the Supreme Court of Florida, but was faced with the provisions of Fla.

The supreme court held that ch. 70-80 did not relate to the qualifications one was required to possess in order to hold office, but merely set forth the conditions under which the individual may become eligible to be a candidate. The legislature had considered it inequitable for an elected official or appointed official holding office to use the prestige and power of that office in seeking election to a higher or different office. Furthermore, by providing for prospective resignations the public would not be compelled to bear the unnecessary cost of special elections. Finally, to construe ch. 70-80 as imposing additional qualifications would have been to legislate and not to interpret.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that a state statute requiring officeholders, such as relator sheriff, to resign from office before qualifying as a candidate for Congress was constitutional. The court decided the statute did not change qualifications of congressional representatives. A three-judge federal court, in an action by another sheriff, held the statute did change qualifications, and ordered respondent secretary of state to allow that sheriff to run for Congress without resigning first. Relator then sued in the federal court, but his suit was dismissed because his appeal from the state supreme court had to be to the U.S. Supreme Court. On the ground that mandamus is a legal remedy of an equitable nature, the state supreme court then granted a rehearing, stayed its decision to allow time for relator to seek a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court, and ordered respondent to file and process relator's qualifying papers. Comity, equity, and fairness required the stay in light of the intervening federal court decision that officeholders could not be required to resign their offices to run for Congress. However, if relator obtained no further stay, then his name could not be included on the ballot.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant contested judgment in the Circuit Court, Orange County (Florida), holding the Financial Responsibility Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 324, unconstitutional in part. Appellee had filed an action for injunctive and declaratory relief, stating that because of limited financial ability, she was unable to procure insurance, post bond, or become self insured when her drivers' license was suspended without a hearing on culpability.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In assessing the constitutionality of the Financial Responsibility Law, Fla. Stat. ch. 324, as to motor vehicles, the court did not agree that the act violated equal protection or due process. It determined that all owners and operators of motor vehicles were treated alike. Further, classifying those at fault in causing an accident with those not at fault was not unconstitutional. The fact that the owner or operator not at fault in an accident was required to obtain insurance did not constitute the imposition of a penalty on the innocent motorist. Thus, appellee's contention that Florida's financial responsibility law denied equal protection to the poor or indigent was without merit. As appellee failed to show that the law violated any constitutional provision, the judgment of the lower court was quashed and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

In opposition, respondent state agency argued that mandamus would not lie to compel it to place a minority party's candidate on the general election ballot. Noting that new political parties must be afforded an opportunity to meet reasonable requirements for ballot inclusion, the state supreme court concluded that state laws were unconstitutional where they were applied to reject ballot position to minor political party and independent candidacies. In denying the relator's petition for a writ of mandamus with prejudice, however, the court concluded that he could timely reapply to the state agency for qualification as his party's candidate for governor if he secured a minimum of five percent of the qualified, registered state voters in compliance with Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees entered into an agreement to sell food products in Florida, including imitation milk products. Appellant state agriculture department opposed the marketing of the latter products, arguing that they qualified as filled milk products and were prohibited by Fla. Stat. ch. 502.151. Appellees filed a declaratory action in the circuit court seeking a determination of their rights under the statute. After the circuit court declared the statute unconstitutional, appellant sought review. In affirming, the reviewing court concluded that, although the legislature had the power to regulate the sale of dairy products in the interest of health and welfare, such regulatory acts depended upon the existence of certain facts for validity, and such statutes could cease to be constitutionally valid when that certain set of facts ceased to exist. Once the legislature decided that imitation milk could be sold as a milk substitute so long as it was labeled &quot;imitation milk,&quot; this removed the constitutional props out from under the filled milk prohibition. Thus, Fla. Stat. ch. 502.151 was no longer a valid statute.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The circuit court judgment declaring state statute unconstitutional was affirmed, as subsequent legislation permitting the sale of imitation milk so long as it was labeled as such removed the concern that consumers would confuse filled milks, as prohibited by the statute, with real milk and thereby be defrauded.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent filed suit challenging the validity of a tax assessment against property owned by respondent. The tax assessor classified the property as non-agricultural based on respondent's use of the property for its mining operation. The trial court granted summary judgment in respondent's favor. On appeal, the supreme court revered the judgment. According to the supreme court, there was a genuine issue of whether the property was taxed exempt. The supreme court rejected respondent's argument that because the lessee was using the property for agricultural purposes the property should have been classified as agricultural. The supreme court held that a taxpayer-landowner was not entitled to an agricultural classification by virtue of a lessee's use of the land if the land was, at the same time, serving another use or purpose of the landowner. Moreover, the court held that the legislative classification of agricultural lands for tax purposes was intended to benefit the owner whose lands were dedicated to the named agricultural purposes exclusively and was not intend to give preferential tax treatment to land that also accommodated an incidental use for agricultural purposes.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner minor was adjudged delinquent by the juvenile court and appealed. While her appeal was pending, petitioner requested release from custody despite Fla. Stat. ch. 39.14(5) (1969), which stated that an appeal did not operate as a supersedeas, except for a permanent order of commitment to a licensed child-placing agency or department of public welfare for subsequent adoption. Petitioner argued that this statute was unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection of the law. Even though petitioner had not requested a grant supersedeas, the court held that this failure to seek relief below did not preclude its consideration of the matter. After argument and in view of the time element involved, the court relinquished jurisdiction, directing that the case be temporarily remanded to the trial court for evaluation. The court noted that the juvenile court judge had the discretion to release petitioner from custody during her appeal, under reasonable conditions, if such release would not be detrimental to the minor or to society.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged an order of summary judgment that declared Fla. Stat. ch. 849.093, which authorized bingo games, to be unconstitutional and void and that enjoined appellant from conducting bingo games at its clubhouse. In reversing, the state supreme court concluded that, at the time the state constitution was being prepared and approved by the state legislature in 1968, state lawmakers simultaneously authorized the regulation of bingo. It would be unreasonable to conclude that the people in adopting the constitution, which declared lotteries illegal but permitted parimutuel pools, intended to permit some citizens to continue their betting at race tracks while at the same time prohibiting others from continuing to conduct bingo games at social gatherings. In passing the bingo statute, the legislature construed the constitution as permitting this form of recreation, and the state courts should abide by the will of the legislature in its construction of the constitution.</SPAN></P>

Appellant denied any negligence, raised defenses of contributory negligence and third party negligence, and challenged the constitutionality of ch. 357.08 on the grounds that it was vague, ambiguous and did not specify a standard with any decree of certainty. The trial court denied appellant's motion to hold the statute unconstitutional and charged the jury that violation of the statute would be evidence of negligence on the part of the railroad. The jury returned a verdict in favor of appellee. The court rejected appellant's contention that the term &quot;adequate lighting&quot; in the statute was so vague and indefinite that it could not be executed and rendered the statute void. The court found that the legislature could not feasibly define adequate lighting with any fixed standard, because what was adequate would vary according to the circumstances existing at each crossing.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">City of Miami Beach, Fla., Ordinance 1717 provided that the annual occupational license for an attorney cost $ 85.00. Fla. Stat. ch. 18013 (1937) provided that no municipal license tax in excess of $ 15.00 per year could be imposed in counties of a specific size, including Dade County. Appellants, the city and the clerk, attempted to secure payment of the $ 85.00 fee from appellee attorney. The circuit court by writ of mandamus commanded appellants to issue the license to appellee without payment of the $ 85.00 fee. On appeal, the court found that a fair reading of the title of ch. 18013 would lead one to conclude that a county license tax was being imposed to raise money to provide for a county law library. The title gave no hint that the act also provided for municipal license taxes. Therefore, municipal license taxes were outside the scope of the title and therefore, that portion of the act purporting to legislate such taxes was unconstitutional. Thus, the writ of mandamus was quashed, the order of final judgment was reversed, and the cause was remanded with instructions to enter an order consistent with this opinion.</SPAN></P>

On remand, the trial court entered an order that held Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 500.151(2) unconstitutional. This subsection provided that the possession of a drug under Fla. Stat.

The court reversed the judgment of the lower court and remanded the matter for further proceedings, concluding that &sect; 500.151(2) was constitutional because there was a rational connection between the fact proven and the ultimate fact presumed and reasonable opportunity was afforded to rebut the presumption.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Relying on a broad definition of &quot;business&quot; set forth in an amendment to the Florida Revenue Act of 1949 (Act), Fla. Stat. ch. 212.02(9) (1968), respondent state department of revenue subjected relator public housing authority to an excise tax on rentals. Although no public housing authority in Florida had ever been subjected to such tax, relator paid the tax under protest and instituted refund proceedings. Relator moved for a peremptory writ notwithstanding the return of respondents. The court granted the motion, holding that the state legislature had to use unmistakable language to overturn long-standing legal precedent that the excise tax on rentals, imposed by ch. 212.03 (1957) of the Act, was inapplicable to housing authorities created and operating pursuant to the Public Housing Authority Act, Fla. Stat. ch. 423 (1957). Finding that such legislative intent certainly was doubtful, the court adopted the meaning most favorable to relator taxpayer and construed the tax statute against respondents. Because the legislature quite possibly never intended to impose such a tax, the court's approval would have been tantamount to an unconstitutional tax levy by a judicial body.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, appellant stated that appellee employed objective or subjective means or methods for the purpose of determining the refractive powers of the eyes, or any visual, muscular, neurological or anatomic anomalies of the eyes and their appendages. The trial court dismissed the charges, finding the statute unconstitutionally vague and ambiguous because of a lack of definition of what was meant by &quot;objective or subjective means or methods.&quot; As a result, the trial court concluded that the statute deprived appellee of his constitutional right to due process. Appellant sought review. The court reversed and remanded, holding that the statute was constitutional because it clearly condemned diagnosing the human eye or its appendages and on the basis of such diagnosis prescribing corrective lenses, etc., for the relief of any insufficiencies or abnormalities of the eye discovered by such diagnosis.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and remanded the trial court's final judgment that dismissed charges brought against appellee for engaging in the practice of optometry without a license, holding that the statute was neither unconstitutionally vague nor a violation of appellee's right to constitutional due process. In fact, the purportedly vague words &quot;objective or subjective&quot; could be completely eliminated without affecting the statute's purpose or meaning.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county school board, having brought a declaratory judgment against appellee state officials, sought reversal of the order of a Brevard County (Florida) trial court declaring Fla.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county school board filed suit against appellees state treasurer, state board of education and education commissioner, and junior college board of trustees, seeking a declaratory judgment that Fla. Stat. chs. 230.0111(2) and 230.0117(7) (1967) were unconstitutional. Appellant contended that it had the exclusive power to set local school taxes and to regulate the free educational system in the county, and that in consequence, junior colleges either should be controlled by it or should not be permitted to receive local funding under the provisions of chs. 230.0111(2) and 230.0117(7). The trial court found the statutes constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that when a local district which promoted the establishment of a junior college later withdraw that funding, the state could likewise withdraw state support for the local school district pursuant to the challenged statutes. The court determined that junior colleges were part of the public school system authorized by Fla. Const. art. IX.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee challenged the constitutional validity of Fla. Laws ch. 67.374, which amended Fla. Stat. ch. 440.25(3)(c) insofar as it related to the contents of compensation orders. The statute stated that an order making an award or rejecting a claim shall set forth the findings of ultimate facts and the mandate, and the order need not include any other reasons or justification for such mandate. Petitioner argued that the amendment improperly invaded the function of the state judicial branch of government. The court found that the purpose of the amendment was to reduce the length of compensation orders by eliminating the requirement that matters other than the appropriate findings of fact be included in such orders. The court determined that the legislature did not intend to eliminate the need for judges of industrial claims to make findings of fact. The court found that the compensation order in petitioner's case failed to meet statutory standards. Therefore, the order was vacated and the case remanded for an appropriate compensation order.</SPAN></P>

Stat. ch. 398. Challenging the statute's constitutionality, appellant sought review. The court affirmed, holding that appellee state could constitutionally interfere with the possession and/or use of marijuana by an individual in the privacy of his own home. Because marijuana, in addition to harming the individual, was a threat to society as a whole, the court had no difficulty in upholding its prohibition by the state. Finding that marijuana use did not constitute &quot;private consumption of ideas or information,&quot; the court held that no constitutional rights were implicated by its prohibition. Finally, because the affidavit for a search warrant used the present tense alleging that a violation was continuing right up to the time the warrant issued, the failure to specify a date did not render the affidavit defective.</SPAN></P>

The lower court reversed in part, holding that corporations could only recover usurious interest, and not principle. The court affirmed and held that while the corporate entity may generally be disregarded where it is used as a cloak or cover for fraud or illegality, the corporate entity of a corporation organized merely for the purpose of executing a mortgage on terms usurious in the case of an individual could not be disregarded in order to let in the defense of usury, available to an individual but not to the corporation.</SPAN></P>

By direct appeal appellants now contested the finding that the statute was unconstitutional,&nbsp;Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 4(2). The court held that the essence of the judge's ruling regarding the statute was that the statute granted certain powers to the board without explicating appropriate standards according to which the exercise of those powers should be limited.

Respondent filed suit against petitioner apartment owner. Respondent sought compensatory damages under Fla. Stat. ch. 768.03 (1965), and as estate administrator, Fla. Stat. ch. 45.11 (1965), he sought compensatory and punitive damages. The trial court awarded plaintiff compensatory and punitive damages. The intermediate appellate court affirmed. The court affirmed because there was a longstanding rule that compensatory damages survived the death of the injured person. The public policy behind punitive damages was to punish the tortfeasor, and a wrongdoer could be punished even after the injured party's death. Punitive damage claims survived death. Because a respondent's daughter had a cause of action, and that cause of action did not die, he was entitled to recover punitive damages. The court found that the trial court properly awarded punitive damages, even though petitioner presented evidence that such an award would cause it to become bankrupt, because the financial evidence was not sufficient to establish that petitioner would have been forced into bankruptcy by the award of punitive damages.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment of the intermediate appellate court that found petitioner was required to pay punitive damages after the death respondent's daughter was affirmed because the public policy behind punitive damages was to punish the wrongdoer, and a wrongdoer could be punished even after the tortfeasor's death.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county commission members challenged the constitutional amendment to Fla. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 9 authorizing a partial or complete departure from the existing county commission scheme within Duval County and permitting the creation of appellee municipality. The court quoted from the trial court's opinion at length, with approval, and adopted its findings and conclusions upholding the constitutional validity of the amendment. The legislation did not violate the equal protection doctrine because the classifications created were reasonable and bore a substantial relationship to the purpose of the legislation by allowing urban services districts to retain their former governments. No evidence was adduced that the classification was arbitrary and capricious; consequently, it was upheld. Contracts and obligations of the former governments were not impaired because the legislation provided that the consolidated government was subject to all of the liabilities of the former governments. This included all outstanding bonds. The other claims raised by appellants were likewise without merit, and the court affirmed the trial court's opinion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of a jury verdict in the Criminal Court of Record of Hillsborough County (Florida), which convicted defendant of possession of narcotics, and argued that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 398.20 was unconstitutional because it put the burden of proof on defendant and called the jury's attention to the fact that he failed to testify on his own behalf, and that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for possession of narcotics. At trial, defendant objected to a jury charge based Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 398.20 and alleged that &sect; 398.20 was unconstitutional because it placed the burden of proof on defendant to prove any exemption, exception, excuse, or proviso for possession of narcotics, in violation of the constitution, and that the reading of the statute amounted to a comment from the court, which called the jury's attention to the fact that defendant failed to testify on his own behalf. On review, the court found that &sect; 398.03 made it unlawful to possess any narcotic drug except as authorized by Fla. Stat. &sect; 398. Finding the statute valid, the court held that the state was not required to prove the nonexistence of each exception because those matters were properly part of defendant's case. The court noted that defendant had the prerogative of establishing his exempt status. The court held it was not error to overrule defendant's motion to suppress because there was no question that the arresting officers had probable cause to make a valid arrest, and the evidence obtained by a search incident to that arrest was properly admitted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions for first-degree murder and their death sentences. The court reviewed the evidence against defendants presented at trial and held that, though entirely circumstantial, the evidence was abundantly substantial and convincing that defendants committed the murder they were accused of. The court found no merit in defendants' claim that the jury's ability to recommend a sentence of death was an invalid delegation to the jury of the power to award punishment, a prerogative of the court. The court held that it was the prerogative of the legislature to define crimes and prescribe punishments and not the sole prerogative of a trial court. The court held that the involuntary taking of defendants' blood samples did not violate their constitutional rights to due process of law pursuant to prior case precedent. The court held that defendants' attack of the death penalty in general had no merit. The court found that defendants presented no appealable issues with regard to their guilt and so affirmed their convictions and death sentences.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of first degree murder for the slaying of his wife. The jury did not recommend mercy. Appellant contended that his conviction was tainted by numerous constitutional errors which required a reversal and a remand for a new trial. The court stated that appellant neither contended that he was denied the opportunity of exercising his right to seek the assistance of appointed counsel, nor attempted to demonstrate any recognizable form of prejudice to his cause by the lapse in time between arrest and representation. Thus, the court held that appellant's assertion that he was deprived of his right to counsel was wholly without merit. Further, appellant's attack on the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 919.23(2), which allowed a jury in capital cases to make a recommendation of mercy, was meritless. The court held that appellant's conviction was justified, amply supported by the evidence, and free from constitutional error.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court held the effect of the refusal to give any instruction on third degree murder or assault with intent to commit third degree murder deprived defendant of the statutory right to have the jury consider such lesser degree. The crime of murder in the first degree and the crime of assault with intent to commit murder in the first degree were each divisible into degrees, and the trial judge was under a duty to instruct on all degrees, including the crime charged, and all degrees less than the crime charged. This included the crime of assault with intent to commit murder in the third degree, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 782.04, where the assault was committed during the commission of a felony.

One purpose of &sect; 286.011 was to maintain the faith of the public in the government. Regardless of their good intentions, the court said, the boards and commissions, through devious ways, should not be allowed to deprive the public of their inalienable right to be present and to be heard at all deliberations wherein decision affecting the public are being made.

A county veterinary medical society was allowed to intervene as a defendant. The trial court held the statute violated equal protection guarantees and enjoined defendant county from expending any funds or otherwise proceeding thereunder. After appeal, defendant county's motion to be dismissed as a party was granted. Plaintiffs then moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the remaining appellant was not a proper party. This motion was denied. The court reversed the trial court's decision. Fla. Const. art.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the motion to quash the alternative writ and ordered the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandamus, noting that the express purpose of the cigarette tax, as stated in Fla.

The court then found that Fla. Const. VIII, &sect; 6(f) enabled the taxing power of petitioner to be the same as any other Florida county even though petitioner performed municipal functions in its unincorporated areas, noting that its construction of the constitutional provision removed the existing inequity by granting petitioner the same power to levy and collect taxes as municipalities. The court concluded that petitioner was entitled to the cigarette tax it had levied in the unincorporated areas because it was included in the class described as &quot;all municipalities,&quot; finding that the cigarette tax was not a state tax but a local municipal tax and as such, not state appropriation was necessary for the disbursement of municipal tax.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of robbery and, at the same time, the trial judge held Fla. Stat. ch. 921.025 was unconstitutional. That statute required the trial judge to cause the fingerprints of a defendant to be affixed to the written judgment in all felony judgments. Defendant appealed his conviction on the ground that he was found guilty by a six-man jury when he was entitled under the U.S. Const. amend. VI to be tried by a 12-man jury. The state cross-appealed. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. U.S. Const. amend. VI guaranteed an impartial jury trial, not a guaranteed number of jurors. The court held that ch. 921.025 was constitutional and directed that the judgment of conviction be amended in compliance with that statute. The statute did not impose nonjudicial functions upon the trial judge in violation of Fla. Const. art. II (1885), requiring separation of governmental powers. The functions imposed on the trial judge by the statute were not foreign to the judicial function. The courts had duties extending beyond convictions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with violating Fla. Stat. &sect; 500.151 (1967), which prohibited possession of any habit-forming, toxic, harmful or new drug unless the possession of such drug had been obtained by a valid prescription. Defendant pled not guilty and moved to dismiss the information because it was vague and indefinite. The trial judge dismissed the information in open court, suggesting the statute was unconstitutional. However, no written order was entered. The state appealed from the oral order. Defendant moved to dismiss the appeal because of alleged lack of jurisdiction. The court remanded the case to enable the trial judge to enter a written order discharging defendant, as required by Fla. Cr. P. R. 1.670, as well as to state specifically the basis on which he intended to rule. Under Fla. Const. art. V, &sect; 4(2), appeals from trial courts could be taken directly to the supreme court, as a matter of right, only from final judgments directly passing upon the validity of a state statute. In this case, the court was unable to determine whether this jurisdictional requirement was met because the only evidence was a transcript of the oral order and a minute book entry.</SPAN></P>

While the Supreme Court standard for obscenity also was contained in the statute, appellee contended that standard had been eroded in later decisions to such an extent that the statute had become unconstitutional. The court concluded the standard remained effective. However, because the word &quot;immoral&quot; had been held unconstitutionally vague when used in a film licensing statute, that word should be considered removed from the statute under which appellee was charged.

They sought an order directing defendant tax assessor to accept their applications for tax homestead exemptions. The circuit court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to homestead exemptions until January 1, 1970, because 1967 Fla. Laws ch. 339 conflicted with the Florida Constitution. The court disagreed. The fact that ch. 339 did not take effect until the happening of a contingency, namely adoption of a proposed constitution, did make it invalid.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee oil company filed suit to enjoin appellant county tax collector, appellant county tax assessor, and appellant state comptroller from collecting, pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 211, an ad valorem personal property tax. The trial court held that the exemption provision, ch. 211.13, was unconstitutional and that the provision was not severable from the remainder of the statute. Accordingly, the trial court held ch. 211 to be invalid. Appellants challenged that decision. On appeal, the court affirmed in part and reversed in part. That part of ch. 211, which attempted to prohibit the levy of county ad valorem taxes on oil or gas producing machinery used in or around any well, was unconstitutional and void. The trial court, however, erred in holding that it was not severable from the parts of the statute relating to the state excise tax. Under ch. 211, the one percent severance tax for the use and benefit of the county was to be applied first to the payment of the ad valorem tax levied by the county on such oil and gas producing machinery, with the balance, if any, of such one percent severance tax to become a part of the general funds of the county.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner was the Governor of Florida who issued executive orders with reference to the investigation of corruption at local levels of government. Petitioner brought a writ of mandamus or a writ of prohibition against the respondents, who were judges, in a contest between executive and judicial authority. Particularly, petitioner asserted that it was improper for a judge to usurp an executive order by declaring the order void as a matter of law. On review, the court determined that petitioner was vested with Supreme Executive power under Fla. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(a) and it was his duty to ensure that the laws were faithfully executed. The court held that the essential portions of the executive order of transfer were clearly within the law and constituted a lawful exercise of the Supreme Executive power of the State by the Governor. The court therefore found that the executive order was valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that 1965 Fla. Laws ch. 2355 gave respondent public service commission the power to establish, review, and change the rates of water and sewer utility companies in the unincorporated areas of a county. Because a statutory grant of power or right carried with it by implication the power to make it effectual, the court held that ch. 2355 necessarily conferred on respondent the power to require petitioner utility company to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity. Petitioner contended that ch. 2355 violated Fla. Const. art III, &sect; 16, because it because it sought to amend or revise 1959 Fla. Law ch. 1958 without reenacting and publishing it at length. The court held that ch. 2355 did not violate the constitution because it was not necessary for the title to refer to the repeal of a previous law in conflict with ch. 2355 where there was a repealing clause inserted in the body of the act. Therefore, the court denied petitioner's writ and found that although respondent had the power to impose penalties sufficiently heavy to secure obedience to its orders, under the circumstances the petitioner's penalty, if any, should be moderate.</SPAN></P>

The lower court granted the relief sought by appellees, declaring ch. 193.221 to be unconstitutional as outside the scope of legislative authority. The supreme court on review looked to the law's purpose, which was to place upon those who owned only sub-surface rights in real property the obligation to pay part of the real property taxes in proportion to their interest. The court noted that where the fee in mineral was severed from the fee in the surface, it was subject to separate taxation. Thus, the legislature had the authority to subject the interest in real estate to taxation. The legislation acted to correct a constitutional defect in an earlier law concerning the assessment of mineral rights. Because the statute was constitutional, the final judgment was reversed and the case was remanded with directions to enter a judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice.</SPAN></P>

The trial court also determined that the language in the title of the act, relating to application fees, certificate fees, permit fees, and filing fees imposed under the statutory provisions, was defective because it was misleading and insufficient to place appellees or other interested persons on notice that the body of the act provided for increasing appellees' annual license fees.

An appeal was brought and transferred to the court, in which appellant challenged the validity of the enabling statute upon which appellees based their authority to adopt and enforce its codes and a zoning resolution. The court found that certain sections of the act, when read in connection with all its provisions, met the legal requirements necessary to support the enabling authority granted. Given the extremely technical nature of building construction and electrical and plumbing installation, the court found the legislature could not have been more specific in its enabling language than what was employed in the act. The court found that the statutory authority was thus sufficient to enable the county board to adopt the subject codes and zoning resolution, and affirmed the decision below.</SPAN></P>

The court reasoned that a preliminary hearing was for the purpose of determining if probable cause existed to hold one accused for trial and was not an indispensable prerequisite to the filing of an information. The court held that prosecution could be instituted and maintained regardless of whether probable cause was or was not found.

The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court ruled that the statute was a local law within the contemplation of Fla. Const. art.

The court ruled, therefore, that because the statute was passed without prior publication of notice of its intended introduction, as required for all local laws by Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 21, the trial court properly determined that it was unconstitutional. The court noted that if properly enacted pursuant to Fla. Const. art.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 573.21(1) assessment that it made against appellee for the cost of administrating a corn marketing order promulgated under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 573.17(3). The court partially affirmed and partially reversed the trial court decision and remanded. Sections 573.17(3)(a) and 573.17(3)(b) were valid insofar was they related to the establishment of advertising and sales promotion plans because they contained a fixed and definite meaning in connection with the promotion of the state fruit and vegetable industry and contained clearly defined limitations. Section 573.17(3)(d) was valid to the extent it provided for celery and corn production and distribution research studies and did not delegate appellant unbridled disruption in the field. The plans and studies promoted the public welfare. Section 573.17(3)(c) was invalid because its unfair trade provisions were too vague and uncertain as to support delegation of administrative authority to appellant as were 573.17(3)(b)'s broad trade barrier removal provisions.</SPAN></P>

The high court held that in order for population acts to be valid, the population classification must bear a reasonable relation to the subject matter of the act and the public purpose to be effected thereby. The population classification contained in Fla. Stat. ch. 67-719 (1967), which decreed that constables in counties whose population ranged between 350,000 and 385,000 must relinquish money earned for services performed to appellee county commission and could only be compensated by salary, bore no reasonable relation between its public purpose and effect.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner city enacted an ordinance providing for the construction of a beach erosion system to be paid for by special assessment, authorized by the legislature, against the landowners abutting the beachfront and any other properties of sufficient proximity to receive benefits of protection therefrom. Respondents landowners did not attend the hearing nor did they file any objections to the assessment. After construction was finished petitioner attempted to place assessment liens on those landowners who had not paid the assessment. Respondents challenged the lien arguing that they had not benefitted from the system and, therefore, they were entitled to raise the lack of benefit as a defense to the foreclosure of the assessment lien. Petitioner challenged the finding in favor of respondents. The court held that respondents could not raise the lack of benefit issue as a defense because they had not timely asserted the lack of benefit challenge at the hearing. The court also held that the assessments were within the city's right to enact and that they were not void. The court therefore quashed the judgment for respondents and remanded the case for further proceedings.</SPAN></P>

The supreme court explained that it was a well-established rule that an enactment delegating administrative power to an agency of government should define the limits of the power by including in the enactment reasonable standards, which enabled the affected public to meet the requirements of the enactment. Here, the &quot;essential information&quot; to be gathered from prospective jurors was not indicated in the language of the statute. The statute provided no objective guidelines for the judicial council to follow in promulgating an appropriate questionnaire.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant taxing authorities filed an interlocutory appeal from the lower court's order denying their motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff hotel corporation had instituted a chancery suit contesting its tax assessment as illegal on the ground that the improvements included in the valuation were not substantially complete on January 1, 1967, under Fla. Stat. ch. 193.11(4). Defendants argued that Fla. Stat. ch. 193.11(4) granted an exemption from ad valorem taxation, in violation of Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 and that it failed to define or prescribe standards for the administrative application of the terms &quot;substantially completed,&quot; in violation of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The supreme court found that neither contention had merit and affirmed the denial of defendants' motion for summary judgment. The supreme court reasoned that Fla. Stat. ch. 193.11(4) constituted only a temporary postponement of valuation and assessment of incomplete improvements on real property. The requirement was simply that the separate classification of such property would bear some reasonable relationship to the legislative power to prescribe regulations to secure a just evaluation of property.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Denial of defendant tax authorities' motion for summary judgment was affirmed, and the cause was remanded for further proceedings. The statute at issue was not unconstitutional because it constituted only a temporary postponement of valuation and assessment of incomplete improvements on real property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought an accounting of funds spent by appellee grand jury. The trial court held that appropriations from a special grand jury fund were entirely and permanently insulated from public scrutiny, that appellee grand jury's expenditures from that fund were wholly cloaked in secrecy, and that it need not explain any proposed expenditures on vouchers submitted to the circuit court clerk. Appellee grand jury was dismissed from the suit because the jury panel had been discharged. Appellant challenged the judgment and appellees, county commissioners and state's attorney, sought a declaration of their powers and duties in relation to the grand jury then impaneled. The supreme court found that the funds in question were designated specifically for use in investigating crimes and for defined incidental purposes. Therefore, the use of such funds was not completely discretionary, nor was it specifically protected from scrutiny or explanation of use. The supreme court also held that the discharge of the grand jury did not terminate the necessity for a response in the litigation.

Appellant, the Secretary of State of the State of Florida, challenged the circuit court's decree, which condemned an amendment to the statute that provided that the prohibitions of the statute did not apply to members of certain organizations of a fraternal nature. On appeal, the court explained that regulation and control of the alcoholic beverage business was peculiarly a legislative function. The court's authority was to measure the validity of the legislative enactment by the requirements of the controlling law. Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 26 required that laws be passed to prevent all undue influence from improper practice in the conduct of elections. What was an &quot;improper practice&quot; was for the legislature to ascertain and prohibit under adequate penalties, within the reasonable limitations implied in the exercise of all expressly stated legislative powers. Thus, the court reversed the decree and remanded for disposition in accordance with the opinion.</SPAN></P>

Appellee contended that the distinction between obligations represented by unsecured notes and obligations represented by notes secured by real property created by Fla. Stat.

Finding the classifications under &sect; 199.022(3) and (4) constituted an unreasonable and arbitrary classification, the trial court enjoined assessment of taxes upon appellee's notes. In its determination, the court reviewed the statutory classification of intangible property as it related to appellee's notes. The court held that the distinction between secured and unsecured obligations was justified and that the making of such a distinction did not result in a constitutional violation. The provision providing for the collection of the two mills intangible personal property tax at the time of recording of mortgages or other liens facilitated the enforcement of the tax.

The court granted rehearing, withdrew its previous opinion, and remanded the whole matter to the Chancellor for reconsideration in the light of the new statute. The Chancellor sustained the curative statute and approved the validity of the proposed bonds again. On appeal, appellants contended that the statute was unconstitutional because it allegedly was a local act regulating the duties of a class of county officers in violation of Fla. Const. Art.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 801.03(1)(a), for which he was sentenced to 25 years in prison.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the Act denied him equal protection of the laws. Affirming, the court disagreed. He was charged, convicted, and sentenced pursuant to a statute that was by nature and definition a special classification. However, if the law dealt alike with all of a certain class the equal protection concept was not violated. It could not be said that the Act, as such, was an arbitrary or unjust classification. No arbitrary or invidious discrimination was evidenced when the State, acting within the proper scope of its powers, made special provisions regarding a child molester. The statute created a constitutionally valid classification. Defendant argued that the Act's title deficiency was not cured by legislative action in 1955, but the court disagreed. A decision in a prior case was the result of a finding that a statute was basically deficient in title. The court did not declare it unconstitutional because of substance. The action of the Legislature in 1955 cured the deficiency of form pointed out in the prior case. The &quot;curing&quot; concept was in accord with the law and policy of Florida.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation sought injunctive relief against a competing corporation and respondent director, who served both as the competing corporation's attorney and as a state legislator. However, respondent trial judge found he was unable to hold a hearing on the motion because state law required the continuance of litigation during a state legislative session where a party's attorney served as a legislator. Reviewing petitioner's application for a writ of mandamus, the court acknowledged that the statute at issue was constitutionally valid to the extent a case was not an emergency. However, the court held the statute impermissibly usurped judicial power to the extent it barred granting relief in emergency situations involving irreparable damage. Thus, the court issued the writ and directed respondent trial judge to grant a hearing on the motion for injunctive relief.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee county contracted to build a free library system authorized by Fla. Stat. ch. 150 (1955). The library was financed by a tax levy. The county appointed an advisory board for the project, but the governor never appointed a library board pursuant to Fla. Stat. ch. 150.03 (1955). Appellant taxpayer sued appellee to enjoin collection of the tax, arguing that Fla. Stat. ch. 150 was unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the validity of this statute and appellant sought review. The supreme court affirmed because even though use of library services was limited to those who were residents of the taxed area, this alone did not vitiate the program or affect the creation of the system as the legislature could create taxing districts. The court also ruled that a library board was not required under the statute because this was to be a free library service; thus, a library board would have no function to perform. The court also determined that the amendment to Fla. Stat. ch. 150.06 (1955) eliminated the requirement of a library board where the library was free. Therefore, appellee acted its authority when it assessed the tax levy without a library board.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, husband and wife, and corporation, sued appellant town seeking a declaratory decree that their properties were illegally annexed under Fla.

Stat. ch. 65-563, Laws of Florida, Acts of 1965 (Act), validated the annexations. The trial court found the Act invalid and ch. 171.04 unconstitutional because the Act was a special act in the guise of a general one. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment agreeing that the Act was unconstitutional because it was excessively general and applied only to municipalities within a certain range of population. The court also found the decision not to rule on appellant's motion to dismiss under Fla. Stat. ch. 608.35 proper because it challenged appellee corporation's right to bring suit for a declaratory decree when it was dissolved for failing to pay its capital stock tax. The court found the trial court's decision to permit appellee corporation to become reinstated, which it did during the suit's pendency, did not vitiate the whole action because the disqualification to sue only applied while the tax was delinquent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent was injured in an accident involving one of petitioner's trains. A jury awarded respondent $ 141,750 after it was charged on the doctrine of comparative negligence. Petitioner appealed, and while it was pending a decision by the Florida Supreme Court found the railroad comparative negligence statute, Fla. Stat. ch. 768.06 unconstitutional. The trial court denied petitioner's motion to amend his assignment of errors to include the unconstitutionality of ch. 768.06 and request for new trial. Petitioner's motion for a rehearing, which informed the trial court about two similar cases pending in the state supreme court that involved the same question was denied, and he filed a writ of certiorari. The court quashed the decision and remanded the case for a new trial because it had done so in two similar cases and consistency and uniformity was important. In the two other cases, the trial court had charged the jury on comparative negligence under ch. 768.06 and in both cases the validity of the statute or the correctness of the charges were not raised until appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the state court judgment of conviction and sentence of death, entered upon defendant's guilty plea to murder in the first degree; denial of defendant's motion for a change in venue; and the determination that defendant was competent to stand trial. Defendant further alleged that Fla. Stat. ch. 782.04 was invalid. The state challenged the denial of its motion to recall the jury for purposes of establishing the sentence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Both parties appealed from the conviction and sentence for first degree murder. The court affirmed denial of the state's motion to permit the jury or a new jury to fix the sentence. Once defendant entered a guilty plea, it was the state court judge's sole responsibility to fix the sentence. The court summarily affirmed denial of defendant's motion for a change in venue, finding the arguments not convincing enough to overcome the state court's discretion. The court affirmed the conviction against defendant's allegation that he was incompetent at the time of the homicide. Defendant had the burden of proving his insanity, and there was no error in the trial proceeding before or after defendant's sudden abandonment of the issue. The court upheld Fla. Stat. ch. 782.04, which denounced first degree murder. While a federal court found the provision unconstitutionally formed, the statute was subsequently reenacted and enforceable. Defendant did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, but the court performed a Fla. Stat. ch. 924.32(2) review upon its own initiative. The court determined that defendant was not entitled to a new trial and that the sentence was authorized by law.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment of conviction and sentence imposed for murder in the first degree, entered upon defendant's guilty plea, were affirmed because the state court had the sole responsibility to establish the sentence after defendant changed his plea to guilty, the penalty was authorized by law, and defendant failed to show error in the proceedings either before or after he abandoned the issue of guilt by pleading guilty.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought a declaration that 1961 Fla. Laws ch. 1595 (ch. 61-1595) was invalid and that he was entitled to compensation pursuant to Fla. Stat. chs. 125.04, 125.041. The court reversed the chancellor's decision upholding the act. Chapter 61-1595, which expanded 1957 Fla. Laws. ch. 1066 (ch. 57-1066), established a local rule where a certain board of county commissioners was to pay elected prosecutors a different amount of compensation than in other counties. Chapter 61-1595 was invalid because it established a local law that regulated the compensation of a county official that was not uniform throughout the state nor consistent with laws relating to compensation of such officers, which violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 20. Further, ch. 57-1066 was invalid in its entirety because it violated Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 27, which required the state legislature to establish appellant's salary. To strike only the salary-setting portion of the act would leave in effect only the creation of the position with no provision for compensation, a result clearly not intended by the legislature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The county court decision that denied appellant's request for a declaratory judgment was reversed because the local act setting appellant's salary was an unconstitutional local rule that violated the state constitutional requirements that the state legislature establish a uniform method of compensating government officials.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee sought review of a judgment from the circuit court (Florida), which granted appellee subcontractor's motion for summary judgment in appellant's action for personal injuries sustained on account of appellee's negligence. Appellant argued that appellee was not an employer under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 440.10 subject to immunity under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 440.11, or alternatively, that the statutes were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employee was employed on a job by a subcontractor. Appellant was injured due to the negligence of appellee, a different subcontractor on the same job. Holding that under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 440.10, all subcontractors on a job were subsumed into one statutory employer, and thus had immunity under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 440.11, the court affirmed the judgment for appellee. The court held that a co-subcontractor on a job was not some person other than the employer and was not a third party against whom an action for damages could be maintained. The court held that under &sect; 440.10 all employees on subcontracted work were deemed to be employed in one and the same business and were statutory fellow servants of all of the employees engaged in a common enterprise under the general contractor as statutory employer. The court explained that subcontractors were entitled to immunity under &sect; 440.11 because they did in fact bear liability under &sect; 440.10, either directly by the assumption of coverage for some of the employees on the job or indirectly because of the effect of compensation liabilities upon the terms of the subcontract and relations with the general contractor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment for appellee subcontractor, because for the purpose of the workmen's compensation laws, all subcontractors on a job were subsumed under the general contractor as statutory employer, and all employees on a job were statutory fellow employees. Accordingly, appellee had immunity from suit by appellant employee, and this immunity did not deprive appellant of due process, or equal protection, or remedy for injury.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner sought uninsured motorist coverage after being in an automobile collision. The court affirmed denial of judicial relief from the arbitration award that denied recovery. The state trial court was correct in upholding Fla. Stat. ch. 57.22. The statute limited the grounds upon which an arbitration award could be challenged to where the arbitrator was guilty of acts of misconduct specifically designated. If other challenges to arbitration awards were permitted, there would be few awards that would prove perfectly satisfactory to all parties, and very few would not be subject to judicial investigation. Additional arguments presented were reviewed, and no errors were found.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation filed an action against respondents tax collector, assessor, and comptroller for a refund of property taxes improperly collected. The property involved was immune from taxation pursuant to U.S. Const. art. I, &sect;10, cl. 2, which prohibited states from levying taxes on imports and exports. The lower court found that petitioner failed to comply with Fla. Stat. ch. 95.08, which required such suits to be instituted within one year. Because the action was filed more than 16 months after payment of the taxes, the lower court found petitioner to be barred from the requested refund. On appeal, the court agreed that a time a limitation should be applied when taxpayers sough refund relief; however, it disagreed regarding the time limitation applicable in such cases. The court held that the authority for personal property taxes improperly collected was Fla. Stat. ch. 200.36, which did not contain a time limitation for seeking refund relief. Thus, the general limitation act, Fla. Stat. ch. 95.11(5)(e), applied. The court found that petitioner was required to seek refund relief within the three year period. The lower court's decision was affirmed as modified.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On direct appeal from his rape conviction and sentence of death by the Circuit Court in and for Palm Beach County (Florida), appellant claimed that the trial court made prejudicial errors in giving instructions, that it erred in admitting a gun into evidence and in allowing witnesses to testify whose names had not been furnished, that evidence was insufficient, and that the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 794.01 were unconstitutionally applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing appellant's rape conviction, the court held that failure to indict another with appellant, or failure to indict him singly as an aider or abettor, was not prejudicial to him or contrary to law. Because appellant admitted his presence at the crime's commission, and the state adduced rebuttal evidence that he was not a coerced innocent participant, the court held that he was not taken by surprise and that a predicate did not necessarily have to be laid that he was an aider or abettor in order to afford him due process. Further, the court found no error in giving the instruction. Admission of a revolver in evidence was not harmful error and the court did not find that the trial judge abused discretion in permitting the testimony of the two F.B.I. witnesses who were not previously listed as witnesses. The victim's testimony was that appellant carnally assaulted her, and if believed by the jury, her testimony was sufficient to convict. Finally, the court rejected the contention that Fla. Stat. ch. 794.01 was unconstitutionally applied and held that appellant was not treated unequally in sentencing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant's rape conviction and death sentence, finding that there were no errors in the instructions, that no evidence errors had occurred, that the evidence was sufficient to uphold the convictions, and that appellant had not been treated unequally in sentencing.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiffs sued defendants, seeking abatement of a nuisance on that property, and sought, in the alternative, receivership in the event that defendants could not be required by mandatory injunction to remove the alleged nuisance.

Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the nature and purpose of plaintiffs' claim was not within the ambit of Fla. Stat.

The trial court denied the motion, and defendants appealed. The court held that defendants were not entitled to summary judgment where the motion was based solely on lack of sufficient service, and where defendants were properly named parties defendant in the action.

The court ruled that special taxing districts were valid if they served an important and valid public interest. The court held that while the legislature could not destroy, substantially curtail, or unduly interfere with the traditional governmental functions of county officers, creation of special co-extensive taxing districts did not accomplish this result.

Appellee was charged by information with unlawfully operating a motor vehicle on the public highways of appellant state and within a county in the transportation of property for compensation without having obtained from appellant's railroad and public utilities commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity or a permit to do so, contrary to the provisions of Fla. Stat. ch. 323.29(1), which was later amended by Fla. Stat. ch. 63-556. Appellee then filed a motion to dismiss or to quash the information on the grounds that Fla. Stat. ch. 63-556 was unconstitutional, which the criminal court of record granted. Appellant sought review. The court reversed the order of the criminal court because it found that chapter 323.29 was constitutional. The court found that the absence of a grandfather clause did not render chapter 63-556 unconstitutional, that there was not any arbitrary classification, and that the law was not necessarily discriminatory because it lacked universality of operation over appellant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought rehearing with respect to their request for declaratory and injunctive relief in an action against appellee governor and others. Appellants contended that 1965 Fla. Laws. ch. 277 was unconstitutional, because it constituted a pledge or a loan of the credit of the state of Florida in violation of Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 10. They also contended there was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. The disputed law appropriated $ 50,000 to a non-profit corporation that developed the ability of young men to be responsible citizens and promoted economic good will and cooperation. The court found that the disbursement of funds to the non-profit organization was not permissible, and it reversed the chancellor's ruling. Although the purposes underlying the organization had popular appeal, they did not involve control by public authorities justifying an appropriation under state laws. The public purpose shown was an incidental rather than primary benefit under those circumstances.</SPAN></P>

The court recognized that there were provisions in the statutes for insuring athletes and requiring county boards to secure and keep in force insurance covering liability for injuries that occurred to students while being transported to and from a school or a school activity.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation applied to appellee members of the state barbers' sanitary commission for license and approval to operate a barber school. The application was denied because it did not contain evidence that certain bonds, described as financial responsibility and performance bonds, had been secured as required by Fla. Stat. ch. 476.071(1)(g) and (h). Appellant thereupon sought declaratory judgment that the foregoing and other statutory provisions were unconstitutional. The chancellor found that Fla.

Stat. ch. 476.071(1)(h), which required that evidence that a performance bond of ten thousand dollars guaranteeing the operation of such school or college for one year had been secured, was indefinite and vague. The conditions of the bond were not clear. The obligee and the number and type of sureties were not specified. Thus, ch. 476.071(1)(h) was void for vagueness.

The court said that the fee award did not deny appellant due process or equal protection of the laws, even though fees would not have been imposed had appellee been unsuccessful, because the statute authorizing the award of attorney fees was necessary to encourage prompt processing and payment of insureds' claims. The court also held that the jury instruction regarding the definition of sickness was not given in error because in determining what losses were covered by the policy, ambiguous or uncertain provisions were construed against the insurer.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that for venue purposes, petitioner could sue respondent in any county in the state where respondent circulated and distributed its newspaper, because it would be fair to haul respondent into court there.

Stat. ch. 72.420(2)(a), which purported to outlaw the provision of certain fee services related to adoption proceedings. Following his arrest, appellant petitioned for a state writ of habeas corpus, which was denied. On appeal, the court reversed. The court held that a writ of habeas corpus should have issued, given that ch. 72.420(2)(a) was so vague and indefinite as to those activities which were and were not proscribed that it was unconstitutional, rendering appellant's arrest unlawful.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, taxpayer intervenors, filed an appeal from an order which validated a proposed issue of revenue certificates by appellee board for the construction and improvement of school buildings. Appellants contended the underlying statutes issuing certificates were unconstitutional, the issuance of certificates constituted an abuse of discretion by appellee, and appellee failed to comply with the statutory requirements of the statute authorizing it to pledge certain race track funds allocated to it by law. The court affirmed the trial court's order and held that appellants' contentions were meritless. First, the court reasoned that Fla. Stat. ch. 65-980 and Fla. Stat. ch. 65-1585, were not ambiguous and articulated the subject matter of the proposed legislation; hence, were not unconstitutional. Secondly, no evidence existed that appellee abused its discretion, and, thus, appellants' contention was meritless. Lastly, appellee did comply with the statutory requirements and appellee was statutorily authorized to covenant that it would replace the race track funds presently devoted to other expenses.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court, validating the issue of revenue certificates by appellee board for the construction and improvement of school buildings, was affirmed.

A jury verdict was rendered in favor of respondent. Petitioner appealed the adverse decision. After entry of final judgment for respondent, but prior to the date set for argument on appeal, the supreme court rendered a decision holding Fla. Stat. ch. 768.06, the railroad comparative negligence statute, unconstitutional. The district court held that the jury instruction on comparative negligence, given pursuant to the pertinent statute that was subsequently held invalid, did not constitute fundamental error that could be raised for the first time on appeal. Petitioner filed an application for writ of certiorari. The court granted petitioner's writ of certiorari, quashed without prejudice the decision under review, and remanded the case for a new trial because the appellate court was required to apply the law as it existed at the time of appeal. The court held that the general and Florida rule was that an appellate court, in reviewing a judgment on direct appeal, had to dispose of the case according to the law prevailing at the time of the appellate disposition.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 310.04 was an unconstitutional delegation of power in violation of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was an apprentice to a pilot of the port of Jacksonville, Florida after being chosen by a majority of the licensed pilots of the port. When appellant later lost favor with the pilots, his pay was reduced and another apprentice was chosen. When his contract ended, appellant was denied reinstatement and appellant filed suit seeking a declaratory judgment. The chancellor concluded that Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 310.04, the statute that controlled the selection of pilots and apprentices, was an unconstitutional delegation of power by the legislature in violation of Fla. Const. art. III, &sect; 1. The chancellor viewed the statute as giving the licensed pilots the power to control the destiny of any person who wished eventually to serve as a bar pilot. On appeal, the court disagreed and held that it was not unconstitutional for the pilots to choose apprentices with whom they could work in a friendly, mutually agreeable manner. The court held the issue of delegation of power would not arise until the time that an apprentice sought licensure as a bar pilot under Fla. Stat. Ann. &sect; 310.03. The court therefore reversed the chancellor's decree.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants sought review of an order of the Circuit Court in and for Dade County (Florida) granting appellee county taxing authorities' motion to dismiss appellants' declaratory judgment action seeking tax immunity for land subject to an easement to the federal government. Appellants asserted that pursuant to Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, and art. XVI, &sect; 16, the subject land was exempted from taxation under the municipal exception.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowners granted a temporary spoil disposal easement to the federal government for use as a depository for spoil resulting from maintenance of the intercoastal waterway. Appellee county taxing authorities levied and attempted to collect taxes on the property subject to the easement. Appellants filed suit against appellees, seeking a declaratory judgment concerning the validity of the tax assessment. Appellees filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which was granted. The court's decision was predicated on a finding that 1931 Fla. Laws ch. 15751, purporting to give tax immunity to land which was or could be used by the federal government in connection with constructing, maintaining, and operating the intercoastal waterway, was invalid in that it was not excepted within the scope of Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1 for a municipal purpose. Appellants sought review of the matter. The court reversed judgment in favor of appellants and remanded the case for further proceedings because pursuant to interpretation of Fla. Const. art. IX, &sect; 1, and art. XVI, &sect; 16, the word &quot;municipal&quot; meant a public or governmental purpose, as distinguished from a private purpose.</SPAN></P>

Petitioner, a telephone company, brought an action seeking to have the court enjoin enforcement of the ordinance. The chancellor entered a decree in favor of respondent, finding that the ordinance did not constitute an impairment of the obligation of the existing franchise and respondent was not limited by Fla.

The district court of appeal affirmed the decree. The supreme court quashed the judgment of the court of appeals, holding that the ordinance was invalid because it imposed a tax with the essential characteristics of an occupational license tax and was therefore limited by &sect; 205.02.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayers filed suit seeking an order that appellee tax district lacked the authority to issue hospital revenue bonds without the approving vote of freeholders. The trial court upheld appellee's authority to do so, and on appeal the state supreme court affirmed. The court held that the statute which empowered appellee to act as it did required no freeholder approval. The court declined to endorse appellant's complaint that the bond revenues would be insufficient and thus would require the levying of ad valorem taxes, noting that it had consistently refused to interfere with matters of business policy and judgment incident to issuance of revenue bonds absent a showing of fraud of violation of legal duty on the part of the governing body. Finally, as to appellant's complaint that lands were unconstitutionally included in the district, the court observed that such impropriety was irrelevant to appellee's power.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court's judgment was affirmed. Appellee tax district had the statutory power to issue revenue bonds, the wisdom of that decision was not an appealable issue, and the fact that land may have been improperly placed under appellee's purview did not affect appellee's power.</SPAN></P>

The court noted specifically that the judicial and legislative branches of the government were covered by absolute immunity from such defamation suits. The court also noted that the great weight of authority recognized no distinction between executive officials and judicial or legislative. The court therefore held that executive officials of government are absolutely privileged as to defamatory publications made in connection with the performance of the duties and responsibilities of their office to the same extent as such absolute immunity is afforded to members of the legislative and judicial branches of government.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants filed an action to foreclose upon a note executed by appellee wife. The chancellor (Florida) rejected the motion to amend the complaint and granted appellee a summary decree, concluding that he could only hold that the mortgage was void because appellee's husband did not join in its execution. The chancellor specifically rejected attacks on the constitutionality of Fla. Stat. ch. 693.01 or Fla. Stat. ch. 708.08.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee wife borrowed funds from appellants to discharge a note and mortgage encumbering real property. Appellee gave mortgage and note to appellants and signed the note as a single woman. When appellee failed to make payments on the note or mortgage, appellants filed suit to foreclose. Appellee husband brought a petition to intervene claiming he should be allowed to protect his interest in the encumbered property. Subsequently appellants sought an order to amend the complaint declaring the debt was an equitable lien on the property. The motion was denied and the court granted appellees' motion for summary degree. The court held the mortgage was void because appellee husband did not join in its execution. The court held that the instruments constituted an agreement made by appellee in writing for the benefit of her separate property, and Fla. Const. art. XI, &sect; 2 stated a married woman's separate real property could be charged in equity and sold for money due upon any agreement for the benefit of her separate property. A note and mortgage fell within the definition of an agreement in writing for the benefit of her separate property, and further, the principle of estoppel applied.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and held that appellee's property should be subjected to lien in the amount of the money she extracted from appellants, but the court concluded that no error was committed by the chancellor in declining to hold invalid Florida statutes because the court was not convinced of their invalidity in an entirety beyond a reasonable doubt.</SPAN></P>
