</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant housing commission challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted respondent landlord's petition for writ of mandate, remanded the matter back to appellant and ordered that it set aside its decision on whether respondent committed discrimination in refusing to rent to a cohabiting couple and to permit further briefing on the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Unmarried cohabiting couple brought an action against respondent landlord, under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 12955, which prohibited discrimination in housing based on marital status when respondent refused to rent an apartment to them because it would have compromised respondent's sincerely held religious belief that fornication and its facilitation was sin. Appellant housing commission found respondent had violated &sect; 12955 and awarded damages against respondent. Respondent appealed. The trial court remanded the case back to appellant and ordered appellant to permit further briefing on whether cohabiting single people were covered by &sect;12955. Appellant sought review and the court affirmed the remand, but modified it by ordering appellant to dismiss the complaint against respondent. The court found that California used a balancing test and compelling state interest test and that respondent was entitled to an exemption under Cal. Const. amend. art. I, &sect; 4 because the state's interest in protecting cohabiting unmarried couples was not of paramount concern to justify impinging on respondent's right to free exercise of his religious beliefs.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's remand, but modified it by directing appellant housing commission to dismiss the complaint against respondent landlord because respondent was exempt from the housing discrimination laws because the state's interest in protecting unmarried cohabiting couples from discrimination was not sufficient enough to outweigh respondent's right to free exercise of religion under the California constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county challenged a judgment of the Superior Court of San Diego County, (California), which rendered summary judgment in favor of respondent airlines and refunded taxes assessed on what appellant determined to be respondents' taxable possessory interests in the use of the airport.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant county made possessory interest tax assessments against respondent airlines based on airport landing facility use. Respondents brought an action against appellant for a refund of these taxes. The trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of respondents. On appeal, the court held that under Cal. Code Regs. tit. 18, &sect; 21, there could be multiple exclusive concurrent yet independent users of the same property. The court held that the possessory tax was valid because respondents' right of possession in the airport landing facilities was sufficiently exclusive. The court held that the taxes were permitted under 49 U.S.C.S. app. &sect; 1513(b), because they were calculated based on the actual annual landing fees paid by each respondent. The court held that there was a rational basis for placing commercial and noncommercial aircraft in different tax classes, and thus respondents were not denied equal protection. The court held that the assessments were authorized because there was a change in ownership by virtue of the renewal or extension of respondents' possessory interests in the landing facilities. The court held that that valuation method did not include enterprise value.</SPAN></P>

The court directed the trial court to enter judgment in favor of appellant because the possessory tax assessments were valid and not preempted by federal law.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff assault victim sought review of a decision of the Superior Court of San Diego (California), which attributed 75 percent of fault to plaintiff's assailant and 20 percent to defendants, bar owners and others, and 5 percent to plaintiff and, pursuant to Proposition 51, the Fair Responsibility Act of 1986, Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff assault victim was attacked in the parking lot of defendant bar owners and others'. Plaintiff brought suit against defendants, alleging that their failure to provide adequate lighting and security presence substantially caused his injuries. The trial jury found that defendants' negligence proximately caused plaintiff's injuries and attributed 75 percent fault to the assailant, 20 percent to defendants, and 5 percent to plaintiff and used those percentages to reduce damage awards. Defendants appealed and plaintiff cross-appealed. The court affirmed the judgment because the trial court properly applied Proposition 51, the Fair Responsibility Act of 1986, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1431.2. The court held that &sect; 1431 did not allow plaintiff to transfer the intentional actor, assailant's, responsibility to the negligent tortfeasor, defendants. The court also held that &sect; 1431.2 was not contrary to public policy because a consequence of the statute was that persons injured by an insolvent tortfeasor would not be able to obtain full recovery. Finally, the court held that the jury applied a proper comparative fault standard and understood fully how to compare the tortfeasors' conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Solano County (California), which denied his motion to quash a search warrant and suppress the seized evidence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted, based upon a plea of nolo contendere, of residential burglary. On appeal, appellant contended that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to quash the search warrant, because the affidavit prepared in support thereof included evidence of an illegally recorded telephone conversation. The court affirmed appellant's conviction. However, the court held that the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect; 2510 et seq., provided no room for an interpretation that would permit the use of the admittedly illegal recordings of appellant's telephone conversation to support the search warrant, and that to permit the use thereof would be directly inconsistent with the statutory objective to guard against invasions to personal privacy. Nevertheless, the motion to suppress was properly denied, because the police officer that obtained the warrant relied in good faith on the magistrate's erroneous determination that the recording could be used to support the search warrant.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), which imposed an enhanced sentence for defendant's participation in gang-related offenses in violation of the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 186.22(b). Defendant was convicted of attempted murder and assault with a firearm in connection with a drive-by shooting.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a drive-by shooting, defendant was convicted of attempted murder and assault with a firearm. Defendant was also found to have engaged in gang-related offenses pursuant to the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 186.22. On appeal, defendant asserted that section 186.22 was unconstitutional in that it was vague and overbroad. The court upheld the constitutionality of the statute and affirmed defendant's conviction. According to the court, to withstand a claim of facial vagueness based on due process considerations, a statute had to be sufficiently definite to provide adequate notice of the conduct proscribed and had to provide sufficiently definite guidelines for the police to prevent arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court held that &sect; 186.22 carefully circumscribed the conduct to which it applied in that a person could not be made criminally liable under it unless he or she acted with the intention of promoting, furthering, or assisting the commission of a felony. The court further stated that &sect; 186.22 did not prohibit membership in gangs, rather it prohibited promotion, furtherance, or assistance in any felonious criminal conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendant's conviction for attempted murder and assault with a firearm. Also, the court affirmed the sentence enhancement based on a finding that defendant participated in gang-related offenses because the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. The statute carefully circumscribed the conduct to which it applied.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state appealed a decision by the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which granted defendant's motion to suppress evidence and dismissed the action, which involved a charge of possession of cocaine base in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11350.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with possessing cocaine base in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11350. A police officer had observed defendant drinking beer in front of a liquor store and, after detaining and searching him, seized cocaine from him. The city had an ordinance which prohibited the consumption of alcoholic beverages in various public places, including a public way, but the public way portion of the ordinance had been held to be unconstitutionally vague. Accordingly, the lower court granted defendant's motion to suppress the evidence and dismissed the action, holding that because the public way language of the ordinance had been held to be unconstitutional, the officer had no basis to detain and search defendant. On appeal, the court reversed the lower court's order of dismissal, holding that even though a portion of the ordinance had been found to be unconstitutional, the remainder of the ordinance was still valid, including its provisions prohibiting the consumption of alcohol on public sidewalks, and thus the officer was entitled to rely on the ordinance as the basis for initiating the detention.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's order of dismissal, holding that the police officer's search and seizure of defendant based on a municipal ordinance found unconstitutional in part was valid because the ordinance, bereft of its unconstitutional portion, was still valid and supported the officer's actions.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 186.22 for committing the crimes in association with a criminal street gang. Defendant and amici curiae challenged the enhancements. The reviewing court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that the admission of expert testimony of police officers regarding the particular gang and its conduct was permissible because such information was beyond common knowledge, there was a strong foundation for the officers' opinions and the opinions were based upon personal observation and experience, not mere hearsay. The court held that &sect; 186.22 was not vague or overbroad in violation of U.S. Const. amend. I because the statute prohibited membership in a criminal street gang and targeted the conduct of engaging in criminal activity. The requirement that defendant commit the crime for the benefit of or in the association with the gang and with the specific intent to promote the gang in any criminal conduct was sufficient to appease concerns regarding a due process violation based upon &quot;pure&quot; association.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer was an American company wholly owned by a Japanese corporation.

Appellant paid the taxes, noting &quot;paid under protest&quot; on its checks, and claimed that application of WWCR violated the U.S. Constitution.

In the second action, filed after appellant had submitted a refund claim, the trial court held that the refund claim was untimely. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that, as to the summary judgment, appellant was required to first pay the tax and then follow statutory procedures for recovery. As to the dismissal for lack of timeliness, the court held that the notation on the back of the check did not constitute an imperfect claim for refund that would toll statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent driver's license was suspended pursuant to an administrative hearing in which respondent was found to be driving under the influence of alcohol, in violation of Cal.

Appellant state department of motor vehicle sought review of the order directing appellant to set aside respondent's suspension. Respondent claimed in rebuttal that the statutory scheme violated his equal protection rights because the scheme distinguished between some commercial licensees and other drivers by creating a narrow exception governing the period of license suspension. Respondent asserted that a commercial licensee who never had a previous drunk driving conviction or license suspension, and who was driving a noncommercial vehicle with the forbidden blood-alcohol level was able to receive a lesser term of suspension. The court reversed and remanded the order and directed the superior court to reinstate the order of suspension, because there was some rational basis for the difference in treatment, and the presuspension administrative hearing available to drivers comported with the requirements of due process.</SPAN></P>

Only one plan received site specific comments and objections, which were submitted by a private citizen.

The trial court dismissed appellant's action on the basis that appellant lacked standing because it failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The court affirmed respondent's approval of two plans, but remanded the matter to the trial court on the third plan, holding that under the Friends of Mammoth exception, a plaintiff who had participated in proceedings at the administrative level need not personally have asserted the issue upon which review was sought so long as some other person similarly participating therein had raised the issue.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After denial of their application for approval of a master subdivision plan by defendant town, plaintiff landowners filed an action for declaratory relief and a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus against defendant. The trial court denied the petition and sustained defendant's demurrer, and plaintiffs appealed. The court affirmed and held that when plaintiffs filed a tentative subdivision map during revision of defendant's general plan, the proposal must have been evaluated against the draft general plan under consideration rather than the existing general plan. No land development may proceed unless it conforms to a valid general plan. However, an exception exists, and development may be approved during an extension under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 65302.6 so long as that development conforms with both the existing general plan and the proposed revision.

On appeal, he contended his guilty plea was unknowingly and involuntarily made but failed to file a statement including the grounds for his contentions required by Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1237.5. He also filed a writ of habeas corpus claiming his pleas were induced by counsel's inaccurate statement that the court would review his motion to disclose the identity of a confidential informant. The court affirmed the trial court's conviction and denied the writ of habeas corpus. Although defendant failed to file the statement required by &sect; 1237.5, the court considered the substance of his contentions to determine whether his counsel's failure to file the statement prejudiced his case. The court held there was no prejudice where defendant's testimony that he &quot;had a methamphetamine lab going in the residence&quot; was a sufficient factual basis for his plea and his claim that he did not understand the nature of the offense was unsupported by any facts.

Defendant contended that the evidence did not make out a violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422, which made it a crime to threaten another with death or great bodily harm, whether directly or through a third party. The judgment was affirmed. Defendant intended the victim to feel threatened, and he intended that an intermediary convey the threat to the victim. Defendant's threat followed a series of hostile encounters with the victim, culminating in a fight at school. Under the circumstances, the victim's fear for his safety and the safety of his family was reasonable. The finding by the juvenile court that defendant violated &sect; 422 was supported by substantial evidence. The threat was sufficient if it induced a sustained fear. Defendant's threat to shoot the victim was not on its face and under the circumstances in which it was made either conditional or in jest. According to testimony, it was without equivocation or ambiguity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city enacted a zoning ordinance, Carmel-By-The-Sea, Cal., Ordinance No. 89-73, which prohibited the use of residential property for transient commercial purposes for less than 30 consecutive days. Plaintiff homeowners affected by the ordinance brought suit against defendant, alleging that the ordinance was unconstitutional and was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel. The trial court found the ordinance to be constitutional and the court affirmed. The trial court found the collateral estoppel doctrine to be inapplicable because the public interest exception to the doctrine permitted the relitigation of zoning ordinances. The court also found the ordinance to be constitutional because the city had a legitimate governmental purpose in maintaining the residential character of its neighborhoods and the ordinance, in prohibiting the short term commercial use of residential property, was reasonably related to that purpose. The court also found that the minimal diminution of ownership rights caused by the ordinance was outweighed by the public interest in maintaining permanent residential areas.</SPAN></P>

To the extent these issues present questions of law, they are matters for legislative resolution subject to constitutional restraint.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff surrogate mother appealed the judgment from the Superior Court of Orange County (California), in favor of defendants natural father and natural mother, ruling they were the child's &quot;genetic, biological and natural&quot; father and mother. It also ruled that plaintiff had no &quot;parental&quot; rights to the child and that the surrogacy contract was legal and enforceable against plaintiff. The court further terminated the order allowing visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a case of first impression to ascertain who was the legal mother of a child, the court affirmed the trial court's judgment in favor of defendants natural father and natural mother, ruling they were the child's genetic, biological, natural and, therefore, legal, parents. The court found that plaintiff surrogate mother was not the natural mother because the only blood test evidence before the trial court flatly excluded plaintiff, who offered nothing to show the blood tests were inaccurate. Under Cal. Civ. Code &sect;&sect; 7015, 7003, and 7004, and Cal. Evid. Code &sect;&sect; 621 and 895, anyone excluded by blood tests was not the natural or legal parent. Plaintiff's due process claim could not deprive defendants of their traditional parental relationship. Plaintiff's equal protection rights had not been violated because there was no discrimination based on gender and the discrimination was rational and not arbitrary. The court did not need to decide whether the surrogacy contract was enforceable or to determine visitation because plaintiff did not seek to enforce the contract and had not applied for nonparent visitation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court because defendants natural father and natural mother were the child's &quot;genetic, biological and natural&quot; and, therefore, legal parents. The court did not need to decide surrogacy contract enforceability or visitation because plaintiff surrogate mother sought parental rights independently of the contract and had not sought visitation.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial, holding that appellant's U.S. Const. amend. V right against self-incrimination was violated, because his silence at the extradition hearing was used against at the trial and was improperly interpreted as adopted admissions. The court found that the violation was prejudicial because the prosecutor's comments were used to bolster the weak credibility of the people's witnesses, and also &quot;touched a live nerve&quot; in the defense because the prosecutor's argument was that appellant's defense in England was inconsistent with his trial defense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, faculty members denied tenure, the University Council, and an organization of teachers, challenged an order of the Superior Court of Alameda County (California), which granted summary judgment to respondents, Regents of the University of California and officials, finding no triable issues of material fact as to whether the challenged peer review procedure denied appellants due process of law or violated their rights of privacy.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, faculty members denied tenure, the University Council, and a teachers' organization, commenced an action by filing a petition for writ of mandate and complaint against respondents, the Regents of the University of California and administrative officials. The superior court granted respondents' motions for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings, finding that Cal. Educ. Code &sect; 92612, which set out procedures for faculty review, was unconstitutional, that appellants failed to state causes of action on the privacy and due process claims, and that there were no factual issues to determine. Appellants sought review of the judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed the superior court's judgment, finding that &sect; 92614 conflicted with Cal. Const. art. IX, &sect; 9, which granted the University of California immunity from legislative regulation, and that, therefore, respondents' refusal to violate the privacy of informants in the faculty review process was permissible. Further, the court found respondents' procedures non-violative of the right to privacy granted by Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1, and that appellants did not present any triable issues that would preclude summary judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the superior court, finding that the evaluation of academic personnel is within the area of autonomy granted to respondents under the California Constitution and that the challenged procedures did not on their face violate the due process clause of the United States Constitution or the privacy provision of the California Constitution. Further, the court agreed that there were no triable issues of material fact.</SPAN></P>

Gov't Code &sect; 56000 et seq., was constitutional as applied and also awarded attorney fees to real party in interest, an incorporation project. Defendant formation commission challenged the timeliness of the writ petition. The controversy involved legal challenges against the real party in interest's efforts to incorporate a new city comprised of unincorporated areas in Sacramento County. The holding of the trial court was reversed when the court held that the Cortese-Knox Act was unconstitutional as applied because equal protection guarantees required all residents of the unincorporated areas of the county, and not just the residents of the proposed city, to be accorded the right to vote on the issue of incorporation. This determination required invalidation of the attorney fees awarded to the real party in interest at trial, because it could no longer be deemed the prevailing party. The trial court's judgment was affirmed in all other respects.</SPAN></P>

The documents pertained to an investigation arising from two separate incidents of possible criminally negligent behavior by a physician. Real party in interest argued that the documents were privileged pursuant to a peer review statute. The court held that privileges were to be narrowly construed since they prevented the admission of relevant and otherwise admissible evidence, and could obstruct the attainment of justice. The writ was issued to reverse the order, where the records and proceedings of real party in interest's peer review committees were subject to discovery in a criminal action.</SPAN></P>

Defendant denied paternity and requested a jury trial on the issue. He also stipulated to a blood test and the appointment of a blood test expert. County challenged defendant's request for jury trial. The trial court concluded that there was no right to a jury trial in a paternity action in California, whether by state or federal constitutional mandate or by statute. In a bench trial, defendant's paternity was established. The issue on appeal was whether a defendant in a paternity action had a right to a jury trial. The court held that there was to be a balance of the action's features and the private interests and consequences against the state's interest in not providing a right to a jury trial in the action. The judgment was affirmed because the interests and consequences implicated in a paternity action were not as great as the interest and consequences implicated in the interest of personal liberty and those actions mandating a due process right to jury trial.</SPAN></P>

The court stated that the question was whether defendant could classify cable television for purposes of taxation with telephone, gas, and electric utilities. The court stated that much like the public utilities, cable television service was transmitted to customers through structures located in or on public easements created expressly for utility access. Cable television operators, like public utilities, were regulated by the Public Utilities Commission with respect to the operation and construction of facilities and equipment to ensure health and safety. The court affirmed, holding that there was a significant degree of commonality among these four services and the grouping of cable television with the three utilities was rationally based.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;Based upon our review of the evidence submitted to the trial court, and to some extent augmented by material filed in our court, we must conclude that (1) the notice given under section 65956 was insufficient to cause activation of the coastal development permit by operation of law, and (2) that even were we wrong in this conclusion no notice of the deemed approved permit was given upon its becoming effective sufficient to start an appeals period running.  In the state of the present record, therefore, we conclude that the effective permit obtained by the Trust is that issued by the City on July 10.  Assuming this to be the case, the presently pending appeal to the Coastal Commission was timely filed, and the superior court is obliged to continue in force the restraint against further demolition.  We are mindful, however, that we deal with facts tentatively found, upon the basis of probably incomplete evidence; and&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  that the superior court upon further hearings and in light of additional evidence may find it appropriate to modify the restraining order presently in effect.  In light of the present status of affairs, we are obliged to issue the writ of supersedeas, the result of which is to overrule the trial court's denial of the preliminary injunction.  Our order is that the stay of demolition, previously imposed by this court and now in force, shall continue in force until the superior court issues a new ruling.  This order does not preclude the superior court from holding further proceedings and from issuing such new preliminary injunctive relief, or a new order denying such relief, as may be in harmony with the above opinion.  <BR></SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">CASE SUMMARY:</SPAN><BR><BR></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In consolidated cases, petitioners, an individual and the California Coastal Commission, appealed a ruling of the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), denying petitioners an order preliminarily enjoining respondent bank, as trustee, from continuing to demolish structures located on the trust's land, pending a determination of whether certain development permits were properly issued or, if issued, had gone into effect.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners, an individual and an agency that regulated coastal development, filed suits, later consolidated, against respondent bank, as trustee, to halt demolition of buildings on land owned by the trust, because respondent did not have the required permits, including one from petitioner agency. When action was not taken on respondent's application to petitioner agency, respondent invoked the Permit Streamlining Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 65921 et seq., to obtain automatic approval, and began demolition. Petitioners obtained a temporary restraining order, but the lower court later denied a preliminary injunction, and petitioners appealed for a supersedeas writ. The court found that respondent had not complied with notice requirements that were prerequisite to obtaining the permit under the Streamlining Act; that, even if respondent had obtained the permit, the permit remained subject to a ten-day waiting period, and to certain appeal provisions applicable to all such permits; and that petitioners' challenge to the issuance of the permit was timely. The court issued the supersedeas writ, thereby overruling the lower court's order denying preliminary relief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a supersedeas writ, overruling the lower court's denial of a motion by petitioners, an individual and the California Coastal Commission, for an order preliminarily enjoining respondent bank, as trustee, from continuing certain demolition on the trust's land, based on respondent's alleged failure to give notice concerning its application for, and receipt of, a required development permit from petitioner agency.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Riverside County (California), which convicted defendant of first-degree burglary and imposed a five-year enhancement under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's conviction for burglary of an inhabited dwelling was reversed on appeal because the trial court, in taking defendant's guilty plea, failed to advise him of his privilege against self-incrimination. On remand, defendant was found guilty of first-degree burglary. In a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court found true the allegation of a prior serious felony conviction and sentenced defendant for the burglary with a consecutive five-year term for the prior conviction under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 667. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment, finding the sentence proper although the previous conviction occurred in another state. The prior indictment charged conduct that would have unequivocally constituted a serious felony under California law, defendant was found guilty as charged, and the record supported the finding that the elements that were adjudicated included personal use of a deadly weapon. Under those circumstances, the court found no violation of equal protection in the use of the prior conviction as the basis for an enhancement.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was detained by a police officer for violating Oakland, Cal., Municipal Ord. &sect; 3-4.21, which prohibited the possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages on public property. The officer then conducted a patdown search of defendant, based upon the officer's knowledge that the location was a known narcotics area and that a nearby hotel housed numerous parolees of violent crimes. The officer discovered a baggie that contained rock cocaine, and defendant was charged with possessing cocaine base in violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11350. Defendant filed a motion to suppress the narcotics, and the motion was granted. The state appealed pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1238(a)(7). The court reversed the order that suppressed the evidence, finding that while that portion of the ordinance that prohibited possession of alcoholic beverages was preempted by state law, the remainder of the ordinance was severable. Thus, the police officer was entitled to rely upon it to initiate the detention of defendant. The court concluded that after deleting the objectionable portions of the ordinance, the remainder was capable of independent existence and was valid in its own right.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant regional planning agency challenged the order of the Superior Court of El Dorado County (California), which granted respondent's motion for summary judgment, denied appellant's motion for summary judgment, and declared a portion of appellant's sign ordinance invalid. Appellant had sought declaratory and injunctive relief to remove billboards belonging to respondent owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant regional planning agency tried to remove billboards belonging to respondent owners that did not comply with the appellant's sign ordinances. The trial court granted summary judgment for respondents, declaring the ordinance did not pay compensation as directed by the Highway Beautification Act (HBA), 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 131, and unconstitutionally took property rights without payment. Upon review, the court concluded that the HBA did not preempt appellant's authority or create a right to compensation, because Congress had created a narrow exception to the HBA. Holding the ordinance was constitutional if applied only to commercial advertising, the court ruled that esthetic preservation was a legitimate use of the police power. Therefore, examination of many factors was needed to determine if the ordinance was an unconstitutional &quot;taking&quot;, such as: was the regulation so onerous that reasonable use was denied; was the amortization schedule which allowed respondents to recover expenses reasonable; was the state interest substantially advanced by the ordinance. The court held that summary judgment was inappropriate and remanded because an extensive factual inquiry was required.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed summary judgment for respondent owners and remanded because the issue of whether appellant regional planning agency's sign ordinance was valid required extensive factual inquiry as to the economic impact on the respondents and the degree that a legitimate interest of the state would be advanced. The court also found no preemption by the Highway Beautification Act.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city decided to condemn plaintiff owner's real property under the Eminent Domain Law, Cal. Civ. Proc.

The trial court denied plaintiff's claim of deprivation of statutory and due process rights and plaintiff appealed. The court reversed, holding that the Eminent Domain Law required notice before issuing the &quot;resolution of necessity&quot; under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 1240.030, and that the resolution was not valid because it was influenced by gross abuse of defendant's discretion. The court found defendant abused its discretion because there was a total lack of substantial evidence supporting the resolution, and, at the time of the hearing to determine the necessity of the taking, defendant had irrevocably committed itself to the taking, regardless of what evidence might be presented. The court remanded for a new determination of present day value because, although plaintiff had not contested the valuation, the fact that defendant had already redeveloped the property made it the only practical and financially realistic remedy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landlord sought review of a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which denied his petition for a peremptory writ of mandate to order respondent rent control board to permit him to implement all of the rent increase to which respondent found he was entitled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landlord filed an application with respondent rent control board in which he requested that, on a permanent basis, he be allowed to raise rents in order to keep up with the rise in his expenses, and that he be allowed a temporary rent increase as reimbursement for certain current and proposed capital improvements. Respondent granted his application, but phased the increase in over a period of five or six years. Appellant sought review, contending that respondent's action was confiscatory and unconstitutional. The trial court affirmed respondent's decision, and denied appellant's motion for a peremptory writ of mandate. Affirming the trial court's judgment, the court held that phasing in appellant's increase so that rents were not raised more than the 12 percent per annum allowed by the rent control ordinance did not deprive appellant of his constitutionally guaranteed just and reasonable return. The court further held that the rent control formula represented a rational attempt to accommodate the conflicting interests of protecting tenants from burdensome rent increases while at the same time ensuring that landlords were guaranteed a fair return on investment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial court's judgment requiring appellant landlord's increase to be phased in over several years because it was wholly consistent with the purposes and provisions of the rent control ordinance to require landlords to wait a few years to recapture the full cost of expensive repairs and improvements in order to cushion the financial impact on their tenants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, individual insurance agents and brokers, and their trade association, sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California) that denied their petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief to direct defendant insurance commissioner to rescind insurance agency and brokerage licenses issued to state banks because of the adoption of Proposition 103.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1988 Proposition 103 received a majority of the votes for passage. This proposition contained a provision that revoked Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 1643, which prohibited banks, bank holding companies, and their subsidiaries and affiliated from being licensed as insurance agents or brokers. The superintendent of banks concluded that Proposition 103 impliedly repealed Cal. Ins. Code &sect; 772(b) and Cal. Ins. Code &sect;1208. Plaintiffs, individual insurance agents and brokers and their trade association challenged that decision. The court affirmed the trial court's decision holding that Proposition 103 intended to allow banks to engage in the insurance agency and brokerage business. The court reversed the trial court's decision and held that Proposition 103 did not impliedly revoke &sect; 772 or &sect; 1208 because neither the initiative, or the accompanying ballot materials suggested any application to bank subsidiaries. The court remanded with direction to issue a writ of mandate commanding defendant to cease granting insurance license applications to bank subsidiaries and to rescind any licenses previously issued.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial courts determination that Proposition 103 allowed banks to engage in insurance and brokerage business, however, the court reversed the decision that the provisions that governed licensure to bank subsidiaries was impliedly repealed holding that these provisions were not involved with the proposition, and remained in effect.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant client brought suit against respondent attorney for malpractice, the bankruptcy court granted appellant's request to convert his existing bankruptcy from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7. Thereafter, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondent on the ground that the state's one-year statute of limitations had run. Appellant sought review, contending that the two-year federal statute of limitations applied pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S. &sect; 108(a). On review, the court reversed the trial court's summary judgment. The court found that appellant had standing to bring the appeal in spite of the bankruptcy conversion and in spite of any express authorization by the trustee to bring the appeal, because the appeal was a continuation of the underlying suit. The court found that appellant had timely filed the malpractice suit because the federal bankruptcy extension statute,&nbsp;&sect; 108(a), controlled the case and extended the limitations to two years from the time of appellant's Chapter 11 filing. The court also ruled that the bankruptcy conversion did not change the applicability of the federal statute and that the federal statute preempted the state's statute of limitations.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were charged with two counts of first-degree murder committed during the course of an armed robbery. The information alleged three &quot;special circumstances.&quot; They were multiple murders pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(3), murder perpetrated in the commission of robbery, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(i), and murder perpetrated in the commission of burglary, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(17)(vii). The prosecution did not seek the death penalty. Defendants filed motions to set bail, but were denied because their cases were potentially capital cases. Defendants were later found guilty at trial, so the question was moot. However, the action involved a matter of continuing public interest, and the issue was likely to recur, so the court proceeded to the merits. The court held that although Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 12(a) provided that a person shall be released on bail except for &quot;capital crimes&quot; when the facts were evident or the presumption great, a court was no longer dealing with a capital case when the prosecutor elected not to seek the death penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Although the proceedings were moot because defendants were already convicted at trial, the court chose to hear the case on the merits because the issue was likely to occur. The court held that defendants were not precluded from bail when the prosecution did not seek the death penalty because the cases were not deemed &quot;capital crimes,&quot; and were thus not subject to bail preclusion.</SPAN></P>

This was the same handgun mentioned in a police report by an off-duty police officer who heard three shots fired and saw the third party holding a recently fired gun as several people ran. The gun became an exhibit in the prosecution for possession of a firearm by a felon, in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12021. Petitioner moved for return of his handgun, but the trial court denied the motion. The court explained that the third party was a customer of petitioner, who was a bail bondsman, and that petitioner allowed his customers and friends to go into his back office. Evidently the gun was kept in the back office, and the third party took it without petitioner's knowledge. The court held that pursuant to the attorney general suggestion, it remanded the matter to the trial court to consider whether the handgun was stolen from petitioner, as he alleged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order denying petitioner owner's motion for the return of his handgun. Upon remand, the trial court was to determine if the gun had been stolen.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant religious organization applied to a county government for a use permit to convert a single-family residence into a neighborhood synagogue. The county granted the use permit, and respondents, local resident homeowners, challenged the ruling. The trial court vacated the county's resolution granting the permit, stating that appellant was unlawfully granted a religious preference, the findings for supporting the permit was not supported by substantial evidence, and an environmental impact report (EIR) was required. Appellant sought further review, and the court reversed the trial court. The court stated that inaccurate legal advice the court obtained was harmless error, as only the board's decision was relevant to the appeal. The court also determined that appellant was not granted an unconstitutional religious preference, and the county board's decision that the synagogue would not be detrimental from the point of view of parking, traffic, noise and property values was supported by the evidence. The court concluded that an EIR was not required before the county could issue the permit, and upheld the county's granting of the use permit.</SPAN></P>

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect; 6736.1, restricting the use of the title &quot;soils engineer&quot; to registered engineers, was unconstitutional and unfairly disregarded appellant's 20 years of experience as a soils engineer. The court disagreed. Section 6736.1 reasonably related to a legitimate governmental interest, protection of the public by legislating competency in specialty areas of engineering. Appellant failed to establish an equal protection violation because &sect; 6736.1 did not deny him the opportunity to demonstrate his skills in an attempt to gain status as a registered civil engineer. The striking of an issue concerning appellant's qualifying experience from respondent's statement of issues at the administrative hearing was not prejudicial to appellant because appellant failed to meet the threshold requirement of civil engineer registration. Accordingly, the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

In that regard, the court ruled, substantial evidence supported the finding that the child's bests interests were served by not permitting plaintiff to withdraw her consent. The court dismissed plaintiff's appeal regarding the denial of her motion to vacate defendant father's judgment of paternity.

The trial court denied the writ, and defendants appealed. The court, in reversing the decision of the trial court, held that the findings of defendant commission did not support the decision. The court found that because of the lack of time limits on the exercise of discretion, the former provisions of the county code pertaining to the issuance of a conditional use permit for adult businesses constituted an invalid prior restraint.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant juvenile found guilty of committing rape in concert, Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 264.1, 261(2), lewd and lascivious conduct, &sect; 288(a), and unlawful intercourse, &sect;261.5, appealed from the Superior Court of Fresno County (California), which found him within the provisions of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;602, arguing that he was entitled to a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A juvenile court found true allegations that defendant juvenile committed rape in concert, Cal. Penal Code, &sect;&sect; 264.1, 261(2), lewd and lascivious conduct, &sect; 288(a), and unlawful intercourse, &sect; 261.5. The court affirmed, concluding that a jury trial is not constitutionally required in a juvenile court's adjudicative stage. The court rejected defendant's argument that because any person over 18 years of age charged with an offense which may result in imprisonment for more than six months is entitled to a jury trial, the fact that defendant was not entitled to a jury trial meant his commitment could not extend beyond six months past the age of majority. The court also rejected defendant's argument that he was entitled to a jury trial because the juvenile court had extended jurisdiction pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect;607(b) and his confinement would carryover into adulthood. The court reasoned that the underlying purpose of the juvenile system remained sufficiently distinct from the adult criminal system to support confinement at California Youth Authority rehabilitative programs into adulthood for juvenile offenses without a jury trial.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the trial finding that a jury trial is not constitutionally required in a juvenile court's adjudicative stage and that the fact that a juvenile offender may be committed for a term extending into his adulthood likewise does not warrant a jury trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the trial court's authority to reconsider and to vacate an earlier ruling that set aside his guilty plea to the sexual molestation of a child under the age of 14. Defendant contended that the trial court lost jurisdiction once it entered an order that allowed him to withdraw his plea. The court held that the trial court had no authority to reinstate defendant's guilty plea without his acquiescence.  Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1018 permits the defendant, and only the defendant, to enter a guilty plea or make a motion to withdraw a previously entered plea. The language permits no interpretation that would allow the prosecutor to make a motion, or the trial court on its own motion, to reinstate a guilty plea after it is withdrawn. Therefore, the trial court was directed to vacate its order reinstating defendant's guilty plea and to enter an order withdrawing the plea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff nudist camp appealed from a judgment denying its petition for writ of mandamus challenging defendant county's denial of its permit application and the constitutionality of Los Angeles County Zoning Ordinance No. 10,366 (10,366) pertaining to nudist camps. Prior to enactment of the ordinance, nudist camps were permitted in zone A-1. The ordinance restricted nudist camps to zone A-2 with a conditional use permit. The court found no compelling interest under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1 to justify the inclusion of a private home within the definition of nudist camp. Furthermore, the restriction of nudist camps to the A-2 zone constituted a denial of equal protection under U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7. However, challenges to the conditional use permits were meritless because they failed to establish that integration of various uses within a particular zone did not constitute a legitimate interest, bearing a reasonable relation to the public welfare. The court held that while plaintiff was entitled to a declaration that Los Angeles County Code &sect;&sect; 22.08.140 and 22.24.150 were unconstitutional, the denial of the permit was proper.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision denying plaintiff nudist camp's petition for writ of mandamus because, although certain restrictions were unconstitutional, defendant county's conditional use restrictions were valid because nudists failed to show that such conditional use did not constitute a legitimate interest, bearing a reasonable relation to public welfare.</SPAN></P>

In this case, however, the juvenile court abused its discretion in the newspaper to attend the proceedings subject to limitations on its right to investigate and publish. The case involved allegations of child abuse and child neglect. The public enjoyed a U.S. Const. amend. I right to attend criminal trials. However juvenile proceedings were usually private. Juvenile proceedings have not been historically open. Accordingly, the court found that the First Amendment right of access did not extend to juvenile dependency proceedings and issued a peremptory writ directing the juvenile court to vacate its order.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant priest challenged a judgment from the Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), that denied appellant's appointment to a prison chaplain position, based upon respondent state personnel board's decision that he did not meet the qualifications because he was not a Roman Catholic priest in good standing. Appellant contended that his U.S. Const. amend. I rights were violated under the establishment clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether respondent state personnel board could allow the corrections department to limit certain publicly paid chaplaincy positions to persons ordained, accredited by, and in good standing, with the Roman Catholic Church, without violating the establishment clause of U.S. Const. amend. I. Appellant priest applied for and was denied a position as a prison priest because he was not a priest in good standing. Appeals to the administrative body still resulted in denial, and appellant sought judicial review by writ of mandate. Doctrinal entanglement involved government in religion's very spirit, in its decisions on core matters of belief and ritual. The judgment was affirmed because the only means by which Roman Catholic inmates could exercise fundamental aspects of their religious life such as instruction, mass, receipt of sacraments, and other religious rites, was by having access to a priest ordained, accredited by, and in good standing with the Roman Catholic Church. The state's current requirements for Catholic chaplaincy positions assured such access for Roman Catholic inmates and did not violate the establishment clause.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment that denied appellant priest's appointment to a prison chaplain position was affirmed because appellant was not a priest in good standing with the Roman Catholic Church. The court held that respondent state personnel board's requirement did not violate the establishment clause, where it had a valid purpose to assist Roman Catholic inmates, and the qualifications for the position were therefore valid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants appealed from convictions of felony child endangerment. The convictions were based on the death of their daughter, after a 15-day illness during which defendants withheld medical attention and treatment on the basis of their beliefs as Christian Scientists. Defendants argued that there was no evidence of willful conduct on their part. A finding of criminal negligence was made by the application of the objective test of whether a reasonable person in defendants' positions would have been aware of the risk involved. If the trier of fact determined that, on an objective analysis, a reasonable person in that position would have been aware of the risk, then defendants were presumed to have had such an awareness. Criminal negligence could be found even when a defendant acted with a sincere good faith belief that his or her actions posed no risk. The conviction was affirmed because a sincere belief in the efficacy of Christian Science spiritual healing practices was not a defense to a charge of criminal negligence, as the relevant inquiry turned not on defendants' subjective intent to heal, but on the objective reasonableness of their course of conduct.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' convictions for felony child endangerment were affirmed because defendants' subjective beliefs were not an issue in the criminal negligence action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed from an order denying her petition for writ of mandate to compel defendant as Director of the Department of Health Services to set aside his order denying her Medi-Cal benefits. An administrative law judge concluded that plaintiff was disabled. However, defendant did not adopt the proposed decision but ordered another hearing. Plaintiff argued that an independent review showed that the trial court erred prejudicially by basing its decision on the erroneous conclusion that a claimant must be disabled for 12 consecutive months to be eligible for Medi-Cal benefits. Eligibility for Medi-Cal benefits was governed by Cal. Code Regs. tit. 22. The court found that it was both the disability impairment and inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity which must last or be expected to last 12 months or more, not merely the impairment. The impairment must continue to be severe and disabling for the entire time period, not merely existent. The judgment was affirmed because the disability as well as the impairment must last 12 months and that was not the case here.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order denying plaintiff Medi-Cal benefits was affirmed because plaintiff was not disabled and therefore not entitled to benefits.</SPAN></P>

I, &sect; 2. The court found that the statute was not directed at particular groups or viewpoints, and was narrowly drawn to prohibit only limited kinds of telephone calls. The court held that the statute was not unconstitutionally overbroad because anonymous calls were permitted, provided the caller did not intend to annoy the recipient, and annoying calls were permitted, as long as the caller identified himself. The court ruled that language prohibiting threats to inflict injury was not unconstitutionally vague under the circumstances. The court determined that the trial court did not err in giving the jury a common dictionary definition of the word &quot;obscene.&quot; The definition of &quot;obscene&quot; as predominantly dealing with sex in a manner appealing to the prurient interest was inapplicable to the telephone harassment statute because the First Amendment was not implicated in the prohibited conduct.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

In an action initiated by appellant, summary judgment was granted for appellees. At issue on appeal was whether appellant was statutorily compelled to compensate appellees for removal of their signs under the federal Highway Beautification Act (HBA), 23 U.S.C.S. &sect; 131, or constitutionally compelled to pay just compensation for a taking of appellees' property under U.S. Const. amend. V. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the case, holding that summary judgment was inappropriate because there were triable issues of material fact as to whether the ordinance constituted a taking in its application. The HBA did not preempt the ordinance, nor did the ordinance constitute a taking on its face. A U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;We conclude, therefore, that Alvernaz's defense counsel's error in advising him as to the possible consequences of his not guilty plea, although perhaps negligent in terms of legal practice, as not meeting the standard of practice in the community, did not result in deprivation of any constitutional or other right to which Alvernaz was entitled, and hence did not from a legal point of view cause prejudice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner renewed his request for habeas corpus relief after being denied habeas relief by the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), from his conviction and sentence for robbery, burglary, and kidnapping for the purpose of robbery, with a weapon and a prior conviction enhancement, claiming that mistakes of counsel prejudicially deprived him of his right to assistance of counsel under U.S. Const. amend. VI and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 15.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner renewed his request for a writ of habeas corpus after his petition was denied by the trial court. He sought reversal of his criminal conviction and sentence upon the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel, the result of which was his entry of a plea of not guilty and submission to a jury trial. His position was that the mistakes of his counsel during the plea bargaining stages caused him to refuse a plea bargain, enter a plea of guilty, and suffer a penalty of incarceration for a minimum of 16 years, 7 1/2 months, rather than the maximum time in custody of 8 years calculated by his counsel. The court denied the petition because it concluded that the participation in a fair jury trial preserved all of petitioner's basic constitutional trial rights, thereby rendering any error of counsel at the plea bargaining stages legally harmless.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petition for habeas corpus. The court concluded that defense counsel's error in advising petitioner of the possible consequences of a plea did not cause prejudice, as it did not result in deprivation of any constitutional or other right to which petitioner was entitled.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Superior Court of Yuba County (California), which convicted defendant of second degree murder.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second-degree murder and sought review. He contended that he was illegally tried by a superior court judge who did not live in the county where he sat, in violation of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 69502 and that his conviction was void for lack of jurisdiction. The state contended that the statute was unconstitutional. The court affirmed defendant's conviction. The constitutionality of the statute was not a relevant consideration in the conviction, because it was unrelated to defendant's guilt or innocence. Furthermore, because the judge was a de facto officer, defendant was required to raise the issue in a collateral action. Finally, the actions of a de facto officer, if done within the scope and by the apparent authority of office, were as valid and binding as if he were the officer legally elected and qualified for the office.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was affirmed. Defendant's conviction for second degree murder was upheld, because the temporary trial judge who presided over defendant's proceedings did not lack authority to enter such judgment; hence the conviction was not void for lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a dispute over the attempted repossession of plaintiff's boat, defendant county appealed the judgment granted in favor of plaintiff for deprivation of his boat without due process of law, violation of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, trespass, and false arrest. Plaintiff challenged the nonsuit in favor of defendants county and sheriff. The court affirmed the judgment and held that plaintiff's rights under the Ship Mortgage Act, 46 U.S.C.S. &sect; 951, protected him from the taking of his boat without the proper procedures. Defendants' policy which allowed a third party to take immediate possession of the boat over plaintiff's objection without due process violated plaintiff's right under &sect; 1983. The court held that defendants were liable for plaintiff's losses because if defendants had recognized there could be no self-help repossession under a preferred ship mortgage, plaintiff would have retained possession of his boat and avoided injuries. The court affirmed the nonsuit regarding defendant sheriff and held that because there was not a clearly established law regarding repossession, defendant sheriff could not have violated it, and he was entitled to good faith immunity.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent, a county's department of social services, filed a petition under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 7017 to terminate the parental rights of appellant, who was incarcerated, as to his minor daughter. The &sect; 7017 petition noted termination proceedings against the mother, and alleged that the child had no presumed father as defined by Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 7004, but it alleged (and the mother agreed) that appellant was the natural father. The trial court terminated appellant's parental rights, concluding that such was in the child's best interest. The court agreed with respondent that a trial court could terminate a natural father's parental rights under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 7006(c) before the formal commencement of an adoption proceeding, and that under the circumstances of appellant's situation, &sect; 7006(c) directed the trial court to determine his rights as an alleged natural father according to the provisions of &sect; 7017(d). Appellant was also not denied equal protection, despite receiving different treatment than that of the mother by the trial court, as appellant and the mother were not similarly situated, and appellant never had any sort of relationship with the child. The order was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Termination of the parental rights of appellant, an alleged natural father, was affirmed because the trial court was indeed authorized to make such a termination before formal commencement of an adoption proceeding, and appellant's incarcerated status required such a determination. Appellant also received equal protection by the trial court, despite the treatment he was afforded by the trial court that was different than that of the mother.</SPAN></P>

After a noticed hearing the trial court ordered respondent to pay the spousal support arrearage and start child support payments. The AFDC reimbursement claim was denied, because the dissolution judgment constituted a support order for zero dollars pursuant to Florida law.

Appellant argued that the increased penalties improperly altered the parties' contract.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent bondholder sought the sale of parcels of real property in order to collect principal, interest, and penalties due for nonpayment on the property which secured his bonds. In granting respondent's motion for summary judgment the trial court also utilized respondent's means of calculating penalties increasing the interest rate to 2 percent for penalties imposed after January 1, 1981 pursuant to a concurrent amendment of Cal. Sts. and High. Code &sect; 6442 and compounding the interest on a monthly basis. Appellant property owner sought review and the court reversed the grant of summary judgment for respondent, finding that the issuance of assessment bonds created a contract between the parties and the statutory amendment increasing the penalty could not change the obligations of one party. Additionally, the language of the statute did not express intent to compound penalties.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment, finding that the amendment to the statute should not be used to impose a greater obligation to one of the parties in what was a contractual relationship, and the trial court erred by compounding the interest on the penalties.</SPAN></P>

An administrative law judge found that respondent had failed to comply with appellant's written request for the production of business records, and ordered his license revoked. The trial court granted respondent's petition for writ of administrative mandamus, and ordered appellant to set aside its decision. The court affirmed the writ of mandamus and held that appellant could not impose discipline for respondent's failure to produce records which had neither been subpoenaed nor seized under a warrant. The court determined that &sect; 7111 could not constitutionally be construed to authorize a warrantless inspection or production of records without a subpoena and opportunity for judicial review before discipline was imposed. The court concluded that respondent's business could not fairly be classified as closely regulated, and the exception to the warrant requirement applicable to pervasively regulated industries did not apply. Nothing in the statute's inspection program provided a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff cheese company brought suit against defendant director of food and agriculture department over an order setting the minimum price to be paid by cheese manufacturers to producers for class 4b market milk. Plaintiff alleged that the order constituted a taking by inverse condemnation, contending that even lawful orders can give rise to inverse condemnation claims. The lower court sustained defendant's demurrer and dismissed the action. The court affirmed the judgment. Plaintiff did not state a cause of action for inverse condemnation, and the valid use of police power did not support a cause of action in inverse condemnation for lost business. Plaintiff had no reasonable expectations to a particular price level and such interference with property rights arose from a public program to promote the common good. Inverse condemnation damages were only recoverable for a regulatory taking. The court further held that in light of a recently decided companion case, the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel under Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect;&sect; 1908 and 1911 also required the court to hold that the order complained of could not be the basis for an inverse condemnation action.</SPAN></P>

It held that the department's interpretation of its duty was correct and constitutional and that the department did not act in an arbitrary and capricious manner in establishing the minimum price formula or in making a cheese specific formula. The court held that it had no basis to set aside the department's discretionary decision.

Respondents, governor and associated parties, contended that the statute was constitutional. The trial court denied appellants' petition, and they sought review. The court held that the state's program was not rationally related to the state's goal of compensation for disruption of a veteran's life by call to duty while living in the state.

Code &sect; 2924, that the trustee had complied with statutory notice requirements. Plaintiff appealed, claiming that its due process rights under federal and state law had been violated. The court affirmed. The court held that the effect of &sect; 2924 was to deny a party judicial process to challenge whether the trustee, a private party, had complied with the notice requirements against a bona fide purchaser. This was not state action, so plaintiff was not deprived of due process of law. Even if there were state action, &sect; 2924 was rationally related to its primary goal, the protection of the trustor. Because defendant was entitled to the benefit of the conclusive presumption, plaintiff's lien was extinguished by the trustee's deed, and defendant's title was free and clear of the junior interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the entry of summary judgment in favor of defendant, bona fide purchaser for value. It held that plaintiff bank's due process rights under federal and state law had not been violated by the conclusive presumption of the trustee's compliance with the statutory notice requirements at the trustee's sale of land to plaintiff. The court held that the trustee's compliance with the notice requirements was not state action.</SPAN></P>

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect;&sect; 11378, 11379, and 11401. Defendant appealed his conviction and argued that &sect; 11401 was unconstitutionally vague, as it defined a controlled substance analog as having a chemical structure &quot;substantially similar&quot; to a controlled substance, or having an effect on the central nervous system &quot;substantially similar&quot; to a controlled substance. The court affirmed the conviction and held that the statute was not unconstitutionally vague. The court stated that the term &quot;substantially similar&quot; had no scientific meaning but that the California Constitution did not require scientific or mathematical precision. Section 11401 was reasonably certain so that persons of common intelligence need not guess at its meaning. The court held that the jury was qualified to determine the credibility of expert witnesses' testimony. There had been sufficient evidence for the jury to believe that MDMA was substantially similar to methamphetamine to convict defendant.</SPAN></P>

The writ was denied and plaintiff appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment. The court applied the principle of stare decisis and held that a writ of mandate did not lie against defendant for the purpose of determining the validity of the prior conviction, because the petition for a writ of mandate to review defendant's administrative act in performing its mandatory function of revoking the license was not a proceeding in which additional sanctions could have been imposed against plaintiff by reason of a prior conviction, and defendant had neither the duty nor the power to pass on the validity of the prior conviction.

The court determined that appellant's due process rights were not violated, as the purpose of the exam was investigatory. The court further held that investigation was confidential, appellant's risk of deprivation was remote as any discipline would be the result of a separate adjudicatory hearing accompanied by due process protections, and appellant had full opportunity for rebuttal at the hearing. Additionally the court determined that respondent's interest would be severely impacted by requiring full due process protections for every preliminary investigation.

The parties then went to trial on the issue of child custody and visitation. The lower court found that it was in the best interests of the children to remain in the state to maintain contact with respondent and entered an order prohibiting each parent from taking the children out of the state without the prior consent of the other or court approval. Appellant challenged, contending that the lower court's restraining order was an abuse of discretion, and the impairment of respondent's visitation and his consequent loss of contact with the children were insufficient as a matter of law to justify the order. The court held that the lower court did not err when it considered the effect appellant's contemplated move would have on respondent's exercise of visitation, and respondent, as a noncustodial parent, did not have an affirmative burden to prove the move would be detrimental to the children in order to obtain the restraining order. Thus, the lower court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the restriction because there was no evidence demonstrating it was in the best interest of the children to move.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's child custody and visitation order, finding that the lower court did not abuse its discretion by imposing the restriction because respondent's loss of the practical ability to exercise visitation was relevant in deciding whether appellant should be restrained from moving the children to a different geographical area.</SPAN></P>

The next month, officers executed another search warrant, seized additional property valued at $ 25,000, and posted notice at appellant's residence. Appellant then signed a claim pursuant to &sect; 11488.5 to an interest in the property seized in the second search. Appellant also filed a motion to return the property. Subsequently, respondent district attorney filed declarations of forfeiture pursuant to &sect; 11488.4(j) as to both lots of personal property. The matter was continued pending the criminal case against appellant. The following year, appellant filed a petition for writ of mandate, seeking to quash respondent's nonjudicial forfeiture.

Defendant was placed on probation and ordered to pay a $ 1000 fine for each count. Defendant appealed to the appellate department of the superior court, which affirmed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant property owner converted a property zoned for single family residences into four separate units.

Under a plea bargain, he pled no contest to 10 counts of violating &sect; 1006(a) and was placed on probation, conditioned upon payment of a fine. He appealed. His conviction was affirmed and the case was certified. The court ordered transfer and considered defendant's untimely notice of appeal as a habeas corpus petition. The court denied the petition and held that defendant's conviction and sentence for multiple offenses under &sect; 1006(a) did not violate San Diego County, Cal., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 654. The legislature statutorily divided continuous criminal conduct under &sect; 1006(a) into a series of separately punishable acts.

The order for reimbursement was imposed pursuant to Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 903. Appellants objected to the order of reimbursement. Appellants were identified in the matter as the maternal aunt of the minors and her husband. Appellants argued that &quot;parent&quot; in &sect; 903 meant mother or father and did not include legal guardians and thus the order requiring reimbursement to respondent was without statutory basis. Respondent urged that the term &quot;parent,&quot; in &sect; 903, included legal guardians. The court reversed the reimbursement order on grounds that, based on principles of statutory construction, &sect; 903 did not impose liability on appellants for costs of supporting the minors ordered to out-of-home placement as they were not the parents of the minors, the estate of a parent, or the estate of the minors.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The trial court dismissed the action because it found that the code unconstitutionally failed to state a specified brief period within which a business license or conditional use permit had to be granted or denied. On appeal, the court stated that if the statute was not severable, then the void part tainted the remainder and the whole became a nullity. The code failed to provide any specified time within which an application for a business license or a conditional use permit must be granted or denied, it contained the same vice as a statute delegating excessive administrative discretion, and constituted an invalid prior restraint. The judgment was affirmed because various provisions of the code regulating the maintenance of picture arcades define potential offenders in terms of licensee, they could not be severed from the invalid licensing provisions and similarly were unenforceable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent department of education issued an advisory informing all school districts in the state, including appellant school districts, to stop charging school bus transportation fees because Cal.

The court reversed. Transportation fees, which were not charged for transporting indigent or handicapped pupils, did not violate the free school guarantee of the constitution because transportation was not an integral fundamental part of education, was not a necessary element of any school's activity, and did not impose any cost upon the free education of the poor and handicapped. Access to school bus transportation was not a fundamental interest protected by Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7(a).

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed an order of the Superior Court of San Bernardino County (California) which convicted defendant of four counts of food stamp and welfare fraud in violation of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 10980(c)(2) and nine counts of perjury in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 118 and sentenced defendant to a term of five years and four months.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1987, defendant did not report income while receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and was convicted on two counts under Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 10980(c)(2), one for receiving AFDC and one for receiving food stamps, by means of false statements. Defendant was also convicted of six counts of perjury under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 118. In 1988, defendant was convicted of two counts under &sect; 10980(c)(2) and three counts of perjury under &sect; 118, for failing to report that her two children were no longer living with her. On appeal, the court held that only one conviction under &sect; 10980(c)(2) was proper for each time period, 1987 and 1988, because the improper receipt of AFDC and food stamps arose from one act of fraud that was committed in 1987 and again in 1988. The judgment was reversed and remanded to resentence defendant for one conviction for the 1987 events and one for the 1988 events. The court also held that &sect; 10980(c)(2) was not unconstitutionally vague. The separate perjury convictions under &sect; 118 were not precluded by Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 10980, and a conviction for perjury that was committed during each time period was allowed under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's order convicting defendant of four counts of welfare fraud, two for receiving welfare funds and two for receiving food stamps, because the receipt of welfare funds and food stamps arose from the same act of fraud, in two separate years. The case was remanded to resentence defendant on only two counts. The perjury convictions were affirmed because a separate conviction was proper for each act of perjury.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 12022(a), and special circumstance enhancements, Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(3), and was sentenced to state prison for life without possibility of parole. On appeal, appellant argued that his murder conviction should be reversed because he was tried for felony murder but was charged with murder with malice, that the jury was not given proper instructions, and that there was insufficient evidence of the intent to kill requisite to the special circumstances allegations. The court affirmed appellant's convictions and held that the information charging appellant with murder was sufficient to charge either a violation of felony murder or murder with malice; thus, the fact that appellant was charged with murder with malice but convicted of the felony murder was without consequence. There was also no error in the murder instructions or in not instructing the jury on unanimity, and the evidence was substantial that appellant intended to aid in the killing of the four victims.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorneys challenged a decision from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which found that appellants had improperly calculated a contingent fee due appellants under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant attorneys represented respondents, widow and children, in a wrongful death action. Appellants divided the judgment into the number of shares represented by the number of respondents and applied the percentages mandated by Cal.

Appellants sought review and the court affirmed. The court noted that &sect; 6146 was ambiguous. The court determined, however, that the most reasonable construction of the Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act of 1973 was to require that the percentage contingent fee limitations of &sect; 6146 be applied to the wrongful death recovery as a whole, instead of to individualized shares. The court also determined that appellants' attempt to bill respondents hourly fees of an attorney with whom appellants associated for an appeal was improper because &sect; 6146 did not permit appellants to charge additional fees, whether for themselves or for associated counsel, for the appeal.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state insurance commissioner challenged the order of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted the petition of respondents, an organization of insurance companies and one of its members, for a writ of administrative mandamus directing appellant to grant respondents' request to increase &quot;assigned risk&quot; policy rates by 112 percent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant state insurance commission had rejected a request by respondents, an organization of insurance companies and one of its members, for a 112 percent increase in insurance rates for &quot;assigned risk&quot; policies, respondents obtained from the superior court a writ of administrative mandamus directing the increase in rates. The court of appeal reversed because appellant could justifiably conclude both that assigned risk insurers were not entitled to a fair rate of return on assigned risk policies considered separately from the insurers' rate of return on all policy lines and that the rate increase request should be tabled pending administrative hearings on methods for determining a fair rate of return.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court of appeal vacated the mandamus directing a 112 percent rate increase for assigned risk policies. Appellant state insurance commissioner's decision to withhold the increase was justified both by her rejection of the premise that insurers were entitled to a fair rate of return on assigned risk policies as an insular category and by her desire to wait for the outcome of pending administrative hearings before deciding on any increase.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant corporation filed a complaint against respondents, State Board of Equalization and San Diego County, alleging that Proposition 13's &quot;acquisition value&quot; taxation system, Cal.

The trial court sustained respondents' demurrer to the complaint, and the court affirmed. The court found that equal protection was not violated because the state had placed taxpayers into a rationally-based classification system in order to effectuate the legitimate state purpose of protecting real property owners from increased taxes based on increased property values in an inflationary real estate market. The court also found that the right to travel was not implicated because travel would be inhibited to no greater extent by the new system, which established a more fixed and stable measure of taxation, than that imposed by the old system of unconstrained taxation based on current values.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The voters of the City of Los Angeles adopted a campaign reform measure. Petitioners state and city elected officials brought an original mandamus action pursuant to Cal. R.

Gov't Code &sect; 85300 prohibited the use of public money for the financing of local as well as state political campaigns, making the measure adopted by the voters invalid and unenforceable. The court held that petitioners were not entitled to relief in mandamus because the decision of the voters of Los Angeles to utilize tax dollars as part their political campaign and electoral ethics reform legislation was purely a municipal affair and not matter of statewide concern. Local government did not lack the power to legislate with respect to local municipal affairs of a municipality. The measure did not impact Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Tulare County (California) that rejected defendant's constitutional challenges to Proposition 115 and denied his motion to set aside an information.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected defendant's constitutional challenges to Proposition 115. The court held that federal law did not require a state to conduct a preliminary hearing to determine probable cause prior to prosecution by information. The court held that the provision of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 872(b), which permitted the use of hearsay evidence at a preliminary hearing, did not deny defendant due process. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 872(b) did not violate U.S. Const. amend. VI because the confrontation clause is a trial right that did not apply to preliminary hearings. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 872(b) did not deny equal protection because it did not deprive the defendant of any rights he would have otherwise been afforded had the grand jury-indictment procedure been used. The court that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 872 and Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 1203.1 did not violate the state constitution. The court held that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 866 did not restrict the magistrate's independent exercise of discretion or violate Cal. Const. art I, &sect; 28(b). The court also found that defendant's offer of proof pursuant to Cal. Penal Code 866(a) was deficient.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court order because Proposition 115 and the statutes enacted pursuant to Proposition 115 did not deny defendant of his constitutional rights of due process, the right to confront witnesses, or equal protection and the trial court did not err in refusing defendant's request to call the victim as a witness during his preliminary hearing because defendant's offer of proof was deficient.</SPAN></P>

The trial court denied appellant's motion to suppress evidence of the contraband. Appellant contended on appeal that his arrest was based on a recalled arrest warrant and was unlawful, and the evidence seized as a consequence should have been suppressed. The state conceded that appellant's U.S. Const. amend. IV rights were violated by the arrest on the recalled warrant. The court disagreed with the state's argument that exclusion was not a proper remedy because the police officers acted in good faith on the recalled warrant. The court held that the police officers could not rely on the good faith exception in validating an arrest if the arrest warrant was negligently delayed in being recalled, and the warrant was erroneously shown as still outstanding. The court found that the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion to suppress evidence. The court reversed the trial court's judgment.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 10012.1 was constitutional. Section 10012.1 restricted information that could be contained in a candidate's statement that was included in a voter's information pamphlet published by the county. It prohibited a statement from referring to other candidates for judicial office. The trial court found that &sect; 10012.1 was constitutional and that the statement of appellant candidate was prohibited by &sect; 10012.1. On appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the trial court because &sect; 10012.1 violated U.S. Const. amend. I. The court held that the voter's information pamphlet was a limited public forum that restricted the candidates' statements based upon content. The court recognized that &sect; 10012.1 furthered a compelling interest of preserving judicial integrity and impartiality by prohibiting judicial candidates from engaging in political promises or representations but found that &sect; 10012.1 violated the First Amendment because it was not narrowly tailored to achieve that interest and it was a prior restraint of speech.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner State Board of Control challenged, by writ of review, an order from respondent Superior Court of Sacramento County (California), which directed it to disclose records containing the details of earthquake claims settlements under Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 997-997.6.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Real party in interest newspaper opposed issuance of the writ of review on the ground that petitioner State Board of Control's claim does not rise to the level of jurisdictional error, the standard of review of a writ of review. The court held that there was no case that repudiated the doctrine that an express constitutional grant of appellate jurisdiction could not be impaired by statute. This action under the Public Records Act, Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 6250 et seq., for an order compelling release of records was a &quot;cause&quot; and thereby within Cal. Const. art VI, &sect; 10 because it was the kind of case over which the superior courts had by statute been given original jurisdiction in Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 6258. Because the first sentence of Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 6259(c) forbade an appeal in all public records act cases, it was void as in conflict with the grant of appellate jurisdiction in Cal. Const. art VI, &sect; 11. Because the writ of review was thereby precluded as the means of review of the order in this case, the petition for writ of review was denied. The court noted that petitioner had an appellate remedy by appeal.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that the statute, which prohibited review by appeal of cases arising under the Public Records Act, conflicted with and was invalidated by the express grant of appellate jurisdiction in the California Constitution. Thus, the petitioner's writ of review was denied, but the court noted that petitioner State Board of Control had an appellate remedy by appeal.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged the judgment. The court stated that it would uphold the trial court's ruling if it were correct under any applicable theory of law. The court then noted that the subject legislation had not violated the tax situs rule, the principle of uniformity in tax collection, or the statewide concern doctrine. Moreover, Cal. Const., art. XIII A prevailed over the preexisting taxing power of charter cities. Thus, although Proposition 13 may have modified the California Constitution, it did not abrogate or repeal its home rule provision. As the subject legislation was consistent with the purpose of Proposition 13, it was constitutional, even if it conflicted with Cal. Const., art. XI, &sect; 5 as it existed before Proposition 13 was enacted. Additionally, the subject legislation did not result in a denial of equal protection of the laws.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In 1981, appellant minor, then six years old, was placed in a foster home due to the inability of her natural parents to care for her. Two years later, her natural parents relinquished their parental rights. The following year, an adoption agency placed appellant in respondent adopters' home, even though a doctor who had examined appellant recommended against adoption. Respondents were not given the doctor's report. Nor were respondents informed of the social worker's doubts the adoption would be successful. The next year, appellant began therapy, and the decree of adoption was issued. Following the adoption, appellant's disruptive conduct became more pronounced. Eventually, appellant was hospitalized, and respondents filed a petition to set aside the adoption, pursuant to Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 227b. The trial court granted the petition. In response, appellant sought review, contending 227b was unconstitutional. On review, the court affirmed because &sect; 227b did not violate the due process or equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. XIV and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a candidate for election to the office of district attorney, produced material for his candidate's statement in the official voter's pamphlet. Pursuant to Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 10013.5, appellant's statements were challenged by a voter as false, misleading, or inconsistent with statutory requirements. The trial court agreed and issued a mandate directing the deletion of certain material from appellant's statement. Appellant sought review, contending that Cal. Elec. Code &sect; 10013.5 constituted an unconstitutional prior restraint on campaign speech in a limited public forum. The court disagreed. In sum, the court concluded that the official voter's pamphlet was a unique vehicle of expression, that the state had a compelling interest in prohibiting false or misleading material, and that the Legislature had struck a constitutionally permissible balance in section 10013.5. Moreover, the court was persuaded that the statute was valid because the person who challenged the candidate statement must satisfy a clear and convincing standard.</SPAN></P>

The court denied the writ of mandate. The court stated that the evidence established a rebuttable presumption under Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 7004(a)(1) that petitioner's husband was the child's natural father; thus, the trial court erred in finding that he was not. The court held, however, that the trial court rendered the correct decision as &sect; 7006(c) permitted the action to determine paternity prior to the child's birth, that the action was brought before the marriage when the child had no presumed father, and the presumption of paternity in petitioner's husband did not destroy real party's right to continue the action.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state sought review of orders from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which suppressed evidence seized by private security guards and dismissed petitions against respondent minors brought under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent minors were stopped by two shopping mall security guards while on an access road at the outer border of the shopping mall.

Code &sect; 602, which alleged respondents were guilty of carrying concealed firearms without a license and without written permission of a parent or guardian. The trial court granted respondents' motion to suppress the handguns because they were seized in violation of their U.S. Const. amend. IV rights. The trial court then dismissed the petitions. On appeal, the court reversed the orders, holding that there was no state action because the private security officers who stopped and searched respondents were not state officials, they obtained no aid from state officials in stopping and searching respondents, and their conduct was not otherwise chargeable to the state. The court further held that because no state action was involved, the Fourth Amendment proscriptions did not apply.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 12022.3. The court affirmed in part and held that the officer clearly undertook a course of conduct deliberately designed to elicit incriminating statements from defendant and therefore, violated defendant's U.S. Const. amend. VI, right to counsel. However, the court held that even if the jury had not heard the evidence concerning defendant's effort to dissuade the victims from testifying, its verdicts would have been the same. Further, the evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction under Cal.

He sought review of his convictions by the Superior Court of Kern County (California) arguing improper jury instruction, the language of a statute, and its definition of &quot;armed.&quot;</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, convicted of drug and weapons charges, challenged only the weapons convictions. On appeal, he contended that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that possession of a weapon with a defaced serial number created the presumption that the possessor defaced the number; that the sentence could be enhanced pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022(a) rather than &sect; 12022(b), and that it could find defendant was armed within the meaning of &sect;12022(a) if the weapon was available. The court held that even if the jury found defendant possessed the revolver, that fact alone would not support a finding that defendant obliterated the numbers, and that although there was a misstatement of the enhancement statute, defendant had nevertheless been notified that a four-year enhancement would be sought, because he was personally armed with a gun, and the enhancement was the same regardless of the finding that he was in violation of &sect; 12022(b). The court determined that the jury instruction definition of &quot;armed&quot; was proper. The court affirmed defendant's convictions on three counts and reversed on the count for possessing a firearm with an obliterated identification number.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner voters challenged a judgment that denied a writ of mandamus seeking to halt implementation of Proposition 105, the &quot;Public's Right to Know Act,&quot; as violative of the single-subject rule. The court determined that the provisions of Proposition 105 were neither functionally related to one another nor reasonably germane to one another or the objects of the enactment. The initiative required unrelated state agencies to determine which household products were toxic, establish a rating system for insurance policies, and ascertain which health care facilities had the most serious operating violations. The purported reason for all the provisions--providing the public with accurate information in advertising--was so overbroad that an unlimited array of provisions could be considered germane. The government did not meet its burden of demonstrating unreasonable delay or prejudice. The court determined that the public's interest in adherence to the single-subject requirement should not have been subordinated to its interest in economical government and, therefore, a denial of the petition on the basis of laches was erroneous. The order was reversed and remanded to grant the writ.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed the trial court's denial of the writ of mandate and found that respondent had no statutory authority to accept amended circulator declarations. The court viewed the legislature's decision to eliminate supplemental petitions as an indication of their intent to bring finality, certainty, and uniformity to the recall process and as such the court was not allowed to enlarge the scope of a procedural statute when the provisions were clear. The court concluded that respondent did not err in following the mandate of Cal. Elec.

Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 2234, 2261. The trial court found that respondent's decision was properly reached and supported by the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The hospital that employed appellant physician adopted a bylaw requiring its staff members to maintain medical malpractice. Appellant then created his own insurance policy in a nonexistent insurance company, signed a verification form stating that it was valid, and continued to practice at the hospital. Respondent medical review board suspended appellant's medical license for 90 days for unprofessional conduct under Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 2234, 2261. The lower court denied appellant's petition for a writ of mandate to compel respondent to set aside its decision. On appeal, the court affirmed and held that appellant's conduct fell within &sect;&sect; 2234, 2261 because his intentional dishonesty demonstrated a fundamental lack of moral character that was incompatible with the honesty required to properly maintain the doctor-patient relationship. The court held that the falsified documents were indirectly related to appellant's medical practice and indirectly threatened public welfare. The court also held that &sect;&sect; 2234, 2261 were not vague as applied because appellant was not penalized for mere failure to comply with the bylaw, but in order to protect the public from further dishonesty.</SPAN></P>

The court held that respondent's decision was supported by the evidence where appellant intentionally falsified documents to indicate that he had liability insurance, as required by a hospital bylaw.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant, a juvenile, was involved in a confrontation with the victim. Defendant drew a gun and threatened the victim. Defendant was adjudged a ward of the juvenile court because he had violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 422, for making terrorist threats, and Cal. Penal Code &sect; 417(a)(2), for drawing or exhibiting firearm in a rude, angry, or threatening manner. Defendant appealed and contented that &sect; 422 was inapplicable because it was not shown in the trial court that his conduct was motivated by membership in a street gang. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment that defendant violated &sect; 422 and &sect; 417(a)(2) because neither the plain meaning nor the legislative history of &sect; 422 supported defendant's conclusion that street gang membership was an element of the offense. The court found defendant had too narrowly construed the legislative purpose when he contended that because &sect; 422 was amended and reenacted as part of the bill that enacted the California Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act, Cal. Penal Code &sect;186.20 to &sect; 186.27, which criminalized participation in street gangs and increased punishment for offenses committed with a gang, that &sect; 422 required gang membership.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant intervenor citizens group sought review of the grant of a writ of mandate to plaintiff land development company by the Superior Court of Orange County (California), which invalidated a voters-adopted initiative that the court held violated the taking and equal protection clauses of U.S. Const. amend. V and amend. XIV, and exceeded the electorate's initiative power on several grounds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff land development company petitioned for a writ of mandate, a complaint for declaratory relief and injunctive relief of a measure which was sponsored by appellant intervenor citizens group and adopted by the electorate. The measure focused on city planning in view of growth and traffic congestion, but instead of directly amending the city general plan, it instructed defendant city to enact legislation complying with the measure. When a writ of preemptory mandate restraining the measure's implementation was granted plaintiff, appellant challenged the writ. On appeal, the court held that pursuant to Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 11, the initiative and referendum powers of the electors could only have been exercised under procedures approved by the legislature, and that Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 8 defined an initiative as the electors' power to propose statutes and constitutional amendments, and to adopt or reject them. Since the measure at issue did not amend defendant's general plan, but directed the city council to implement the general plan and a zoning ordinance, it was an invalid exercise of the initiative power. The court, therefore, affirmed the preemptory writ of mandate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment granting the writ of mandate to plaintiff land development company was affirmed, and the electorate-approved initiative was invalidated because the court held that the initiative failed to satisfy constitutional requirements and constituted an invalid exercise of the electorate's initiative power. Since those defects affected the entire measure, the court held, the initiative's severance clause could not have saved any part of it.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband sought review after the Superior Court of Orange County (California) entered a child support judgment, requiring appellant to pay $ 151 per month.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After appellant husband was served with a Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act petition, the matter proceeded to a contested hearing. Appellant demanded that the matter be heard by a superior court judge, but a commissioner determined that he was empowered to hear the matter and recommended child support for respondent wife be set at $ 151 per month. Subsequently, a superior court judge reviewed the recommendation and approved it. Appellant sought review, claiming that Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 640.1(c) violated Cal. Const. art. VI, &sect; 21. The court affirmed. The court found that &sect; 640.1 was a special reference, and thus survived constitutional scrutiny. The hearing procedure was statutorily provided, and the superior court judge was mandated to independently review the commissioner's decision and to rehear the matter if necessary. The court found that the superior court judge made a final determination. Thus, appellant and respondent were afforded an opportunity to have their matter determined by a constitutionally sanctioned judicial officer. Accordingly, the court affirmed the child support judgment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the superior court's child support judgment because the commissioner's recommendation was allowable under statutory law, and thus did not violate the state's constitution. The commissioner's recommendation was a special reference that could be ordered without appellant husband's or respondent wife's consent.</SPAN></P>

The court concluded that the city's police department rule 3.3, prohibiting police officers from continuous personal associations with felons, was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to appellant.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the order of the Superior Court, Tulare County (California), which ordered him and his co-defendant to make restitution to the victim and be jointly and severally liable for the restitution. Restitution was a condition of probation following defendant's plea of nolo contendere to the charges of sending a false bomb and filing a false report with the fire department concerning the planting of the bomb.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with sending a false bomb in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 148.1(d) and filing a false report with the fire department concerning the planting of the bomb in violation of &sect; 148.1(a). Defendant was granted probation, ordered to spend time in jail, to make restitution along with his co-defendant to the victim, and to pay a fine and penalty assessment. The trial court's order imposed joint and several liability on defendant and co-defendant for the restitution as a condition of probation. On appeal, the court ordered resentencing so as to eliminate the joint and several liability condition and issue a new order. The court found that defendant's probation conditions were dependent upon the actions of his co-defendant in making restitution. Thus, the condition imposed was unconstitutionally void for vagueness. Also, requiring joint and several restitution was an attempt to address civil liability, which the trial court could not do in this case.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered the matter remanded for resentencing because the imposition of joint and several liability as a condition of probation made it difficult to determine whether the condition had been violated, and defendant would not know the extent of his probationary conditions. The trial court was ordered to eliminate the joint and several liability portion of the restitution order and issue a new order. The rest of the judgment was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court agreed that the instruction was erroneous but denied the motion for new trial and reduced the first-degree murder conviction to second-degree murder. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment. The court affirmed and held that kidnapping for ransom involved a substantial risk of death to the victim and therefore supported a conviction of second-degree felony murder. The court held that because defendant's conduct as a participant in the aggravated kidnapping and the second-degree murder were indistinguishable, he could not be punished for both crimes under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile, sought review of an order of the Superior Court of Kern County (California), determining that appellant had violated Cal. Penal Code &sect; 148 and was subject to commitment to the jurisdiction of the California Youth Authority. Appellant claimed that &sect; 148 was unconstitutionally overbroad.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a juvenile, was charged with violating Cal. Penal Code &sect; 148 when he fled from a police officer seeking to question him about a curfew violation. The lower court found that appellant violated &sect; 148 and committed him to the youth authority. Appellant sought review, claiming that &sect; 148 was facially overbroad and unconstitutional. The court held that &sect; 148 was not facially overbroad, finding that it historically was applied to non-speech conduct; that appellant made no empirical showing that &sect; 148 was often being applied to protected speech; that persons of ordinary intelligence did not need to guess at the statute's meaning; and that the small possibility of &sect; 148 being applied to protected conduct was an insufficient basis for invalidation, especially because the statute could be narrowly construed to avoid any chilling effect. Because appellant's conduct fell within that proscribed by &sect; 148, the court held that he lacked standing to assert facial invalidity. The court declined to determine whether appellant's failure to raise the constitutional challenge below prevented appellate review in the first instance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court rejected appellant juvenile's claim that a statute prohibiting unlawful resistance, delay, or obstruction of a police officer was unconstitutionally overbroad. Appellant did not have standing to assert overbreadth because appellant's specific conduct, fleeing a police officer, was prohibited, and appellant made no showing that the statute reached a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, the administrator of decedent's estate, sought review of an order of the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), granting summary judgment to respondents, a doctor and his practice, an insurer, and its counsel, on a claim that respondents' dissemination of a medical report revealing decedent's HIV infection was tortious and violated decedent's right to privacy under Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Decedent was examined by respondent doctor under arrangement with respondent insurer, in connection with a workers' compensation claim, and decedent told respondent's nurse that he was HIV-positive. That information was disclosed to and by respondent insurer and its counsel in the workers' compensation case. Decedent filed suit against respondents, claiming invasion of the right to privacy under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The lower court granted summary judgment. Decedent and, after his death, appellant administrator of decedent's estate sought review. The court affirmed dismissal of all claims against respondents insurer and counsel, finding the claims barred by the privilege, under Cal. Civil Code &sect; 47(2), for statements published in a judicial proceeding. The court also affirmed dismissal of emotional distress claims against respondent doctor because his conduct was not &quot;outrageous.&quot; However, the court reversed the dismissal as to the claim of invasion of privacy, finding that decedent reasonably anticipated that his HIV status would not be disclosed and that respondent doctor's disclosure of that information was not privileged as a matter of law, but raised an issue for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant mobilehome park owners brought an action against respondent city for inverse condemnation, alleging that respondent's rent control ordinance was an unlawful taking of appellants' property without payment of just compensation. Appellants also sought a declaration that they had the right to raise rents to market levels at the time of vacancy. The trial court granted respondent's demurrer to the first amended complaint without leave to amend because it did not state a cause of action, appellants were collaterally estopped from raising the issues, and the claims were barred by the statute of limitations. On appeal, the court held that respondent's rent control ordinance was not an unconstitutional taking because it was reasonably calculated to further respondent's interest in eliminating excessive rents for spaces in mobilehome parks and protecting the investment of mobilehome owners. Further, it did not deny appellants an economically viable use of their land. Appellants' inverse condemnation claim was barred by the statute of limitations of Cal. Civ. Proc. Code &sect; 318, because the action was brought more than five years after the provisions at issue were originally enacted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the sentence imposed upon him after revocation of his probation, which granted him conduct credit for time in prison pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 4019, but not for time spent in an alcohol recovery center. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that &sect; 4019, which authorized conduct credit for prison time but not for time spent in nonpenal institutions, did not violate the equal protection provisions of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 7, or U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The court held that &sect; 4019 did not affect two similarly situated groups in an unequal manner, because a prisoner receiving treatment in an alcohol recovery center, where the focus was on diagnosis and treatment, was not similarly situated to a person incarcerated in a penal institution, where the focus was on detention. The court held that the distinction between the two groups was not an arbitrary classification where conduct credit to prisoners encouraged good behavior by the promise of early release in relation to a fixed term, and a prisoner in a treatment center had other incentives for good behavior, including avoiding alternate jail time or an extension of time in the treatment center.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 647 (b), petitioned for a writ of mandate, alleging that the requirement that all those convicted of &sect; 647 (b) be tested for AIDS was unconstitutional. The court held that the testing requirements were legal under U.S. Const. amend. IV. In applying the &quot;special needs&quot; doctrine, the court weighed the heightened governmental need for the action against the individual's privacy expectation and whether the need justified the intrusion. The court found that the public need to prevent AIDS outweighed the intrusion of collecting and testing an individual's blood. In addition, it found that the legislative scheme protected the subject individual's privacy by limiting dissemination of the test results to attorneys involved in prosecution of crimes with a penalty enhancement for sex offenses committed by those who knew they had AIDS. Due process concerns were not implicated because testing only applied to those convicted of soliciting an act of prostitution under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 647 (b).</SPAN></P>

After the trial court denied their motion for new trial and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, appellants filed a notice of appeal and contended that the trebling of the actual damages awarded, including the damages for mental anguish, resulted in an unconstitutionally excessive penalty. The court held that while the term &quot;actual damages&quot; was generally synonymous with compensatory damages, the mandatory trebling of damages for mental suffering could under some circumstances produce constitutionally excessive penalties. The court held that the treble damages provided for in the ordinance were intended to provide sufficient economic incentive for aggrieved persons to bring suit and that the trebling of damages for mental anguish was not reasonably related to that purpose.

The court held that under stare decisis, the court was required to follow the precedent that the proposition was not unconstitutional, as the proposition was neutral and uniform in its application and did not discriminate directly or indirectly against residency. There was no iron rule of equality in imposing taxes, and the states were free to grant partial or total exemptions upon grounds of reasonable state policy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of respondent county because the acquisition value approach to assessing value of property for taxes was not wholly arbitrary or irrational and the measure did not violate either equal protection principles or the right to travel as it was neutral and uniform in its application.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant bail surety company posted bail for defendant who appeared at arraignment when the trial court set dates for two pretrial hearings and the trial.

Appellant claimed defendant had not been &quot;lawfully required&quot; to appear pursuant to Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1305. The court affirmed the judgment because it found that defendant had actual notice of the hearings, that Cal. R. Ct. 227.6 required defendant's presence in court for a readiness conference (one of the pretrial hearings), and that defendant was therefore &quot;lawfully required&quot; to appear as that term was used in Cal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought review of the order of dismissal of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) following the sustaining of a demurrer interposed by respondents, county tax assessor and the County of Los Angeles, to appellant's first amended complaint in which she sought a refund of property taxes and a declaratory judgment pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 4808 that Cal. Const. art. XIII A was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged the constitutionality of Cal. Const. art. XIII A (Proposition 13) in her lawsuit against respondent county tax assessor and the County of Los Angeles seeking declaratory relief pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax Code &sect; 4808 and a refund of property taxes. The court affirmed the order of dismissal, holding that Proposition 13 was constitutional, even though it created an arbitrary system of property valuation which imposed disparate tax burdens on owners of similarly situated properties. It held that Proposition 13 met the rational basis test and did not violate appellant's equal protection rights or her right to travel. Because the acquisition value approach used in valuations under Proposition 13 was neither wholly arbitrary nor irrational, it met the demands of the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The approach could have been upheld on the belief that taxes should be based on the original cost of property and unrealized paper gains in value should not be taxed. Because the right to migrate was not burdened by Proposition 13, a rational basis test rather than a heightened scrutiny standard was sufficient for analysis of constitutionality.</SPAN></P>

The court held, however, that the trial court correctly determined the video games were slot machines. Second, appellants contended that the judgment must be reversed because Cal. Penal Code &sect; 335a, which provided for the confiscation and destruction of slot machines, violated the constitutional guaranty of due process by not providing for a hearing before destruction of slot machines. The court held that it did not need to reach that issue because even assuming that section were unconstitutional, reversal would not follow. The court noted that appellants received a hearing and a judicial determination that the video games were illegal slot machines and that the determination was upheld on appeal.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer and bail bondsmen's association brought an action against defendant county to enjoin operation of the county's own recognizance release program (the OR release). The trial court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint. On appeal, plaintiffs asserted that the OR release violated Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 28(e) and Cal.

First, the court held that the California Supreme Court recognized that release on bail and the OR release were separate and distinct procedures. The court then held that Cal. Const. Art. I, &sect; 28 (e) did not require that the prosecuting attorney be notified and given the opportunity to be heard before granting an OR release. The court stated that the notice and hearing provision applied only when an applicant for bail was arrested for a serious felony. The court concluded that if the enactors of section 28 (e) had intended a notice and hearing requirement to apply to OR releases, they could have said so. Thus, the court concluded that notice was not required in OR releases.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 1861.01, respondent insurer sued to compel appellant to permit an interim rate increase for assigned risk policies. Respondent alleged that it was incurring large losses from automobile insurance it provided to individuals in the assigned risk pool. Respondent also claimed that appellant imposed confiscatory rates in violation of the due process clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and caused respondent to suffer irreparable harm because the loss of a fair and reasonable return could not be recovered from future rate increases. The court reversed a trial court judgment that compelled appellant to permit an increase in respondent's rates for assigned risk policies. Respondent's failure to exhaust administrative remedies barred it from seeking a writ of mandate. Appellant did not clearly abuse her discretion because that discretion was not finally applied to the ratemaking issues. Appellant's decision to protect respondent from confiscatory rates by permitting recoupment through future rate increases was not clearly erroneous or unauthorized by Cal. Ins. Code &sect;&sect; 1861.02, 1861.05.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment compelling appellant insurance commissioner to permit respondent insurer an increase in rates for assigned risk policies, and prohibiting appellant from interfering with respondent's increase, was reversed. Respondent failed to exhaust its available administrative remedies, and exhaustion would not have resulted in irreparable injury where appellant had authority to allow respondent to recoup losses through future rate increases.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of Los Angeles (California) that convicted him of attempted murder, two counts of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, kidnapping, burglary, and felony assault.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with attempted murder, two counts of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, kidnapping, burglary, and felony assault. The trial court found him incompetent to stand trial. After a stay in a state hospital, defendant was certified as competent by the hospital. During a restoration of competency hearing requested by defendant, defendant was found competent and subsequently convicted. On appeal, the court affirmed his convictions. The court held that defendant had the burden of proof in the restoration of competency hearing because he was the one who requested the hearing. The court held that the statutory procedures for determining competency and the restoration of competency, contained in Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 1367-1375.5, did not violate defendant's right to due process. The court also held that there was sufficient evidence to convict on two separate rape counts and that Cal. Penal Code &sect; 654 did not bar separate punishment for burglary and the sex offenses because the evidence supported the theory that defendant had a separate intent to commit each of the acts.</SPAN></P>

Penal Code &sect; 187, with the special circumstance that the murder was committed for financial gain as provided for under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 190.2(a)(1). On appeal, the court affirmed all of the convictions. The evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's instruction to the jury on the felony-murder theory of first degree murder because the evidence showed that defendants had both an intent to kill and an intent to steal and that the robbery and the murder were part of one continuous transaction. The court ruled that the substantial evidence that showed that defendants committed the murder in order to eliminate their competition in the local drug market was sufficient to support the finding that the murder was committed for financial gain. The court determined that the evidence that showed that defendants agreed to kill three specific individuals and that defendants had different motives for eliminating each individual supported convictions for three counts of conspiracy.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed defendants' convictions, holding that that there was sufficient evidence to support a jury instruction on felony-murder because the robbery was not completed before the murder, that the finding that the murder was committed for financial gain was supported where the victim was a competing drug dealer, and that the evidence supported convictions for three counts of conspiracy because defendants agreed to kill three individuals.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent water resources control board issued a decision that concluded appellant irrigation district's practices were wasteful and unreasonable, and required appellant to submit a plan for reservoir construction and to take other actions. Appellant sought review of respondent's action by writ of mandate. The court held that the writ was properly denied. Cal. Const. art. X, &sect; 2 required water uses to conform to a standard of reasonable use, and respondent had the authority to adjudicate whether appellant's use of water satisfied the constitutional standard. The concept of separation of powers did not apply because both parties were administrative agencies, and any objective of separateness was not violated when one regulated the other. The interference by respondent with appellant's use of water did not constitute a transgression of a vested right because appellant did not acquire a vested right to the unreasonable use of water. Respondent was the expert in the field of water waste, and did not have to defer to appellant's decisions. Respondent's findings were supported by the evidence, and its specific order did not exceed reason or the bounds of its discretion.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><BR><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">DISPOSITION:</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;We conclude that because the doctrines of collateral estoppel and waiver are inapplicable to the facts of this case, the trial court should have allowed State to challenge the decisions of the Board.  However, we also determine, as a question of law, that the Executive Order requires local school boards to provide a higher level of service than is required constitutionally or by case law and that the Executive Order is a reimbursable state mandate pursuant to article XIII B, section 6 of the California Constitution.  Former Revenue and Tax Code section 2234 does not provide reimbursement of the subject claim.  Based on uncontradicted evidence, we modify the decision of the trial court by striking as sources of reimbursement the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties &quot;or similarly designated accounts.&quot; We also modify the judgment to include charging orders against certain funds appropriated through subsequent budget acts.  We affirm the decision of the trial court that the Fines&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  and Forfeitures Funds are not &quot;reasonably available&quot; to satisfy the Claim.  Finally, we remand the matter to the trial court to determine whether at the time of its order, unexpended, unencumbered funds sufficient to satisfy the judgment remained in the approved budget line item account numbers.  The trial court is also directed to determine this same issue with respect to the charging order.  The judgment is affirmed as modified.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The California Department of Education issued an executive order mandating expenditures to integrate the schools, and when the legislature deleted the requested funding from its budget, cross-appellant school district filed a petition to compel reimbursement after the Board of Control approved the claim. The trial court stated that appellant state was required to make these reimbursements and designated specific funds as reasonably available for the payments, but also ruled that certain funds were not available for these payments. On appeal, the court affirmed the decision as modified, holding that the doctrines of collateral estoppel and waiver were inapplicable and that the trial court should have allowed appellant to challenge the initial decisions of Board of Control in this matter. However, the court concluded that as a matter of law the executive order was a reimbursable state mandate pursuant to Cal. Const. art. XIII B, &sect; 6, not pursuant to former Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax.

The trial court sustained respondent's demurrer to appellants' second amended cross-complaint for inverse condemnation, promissory estoppel, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, civil rights violations, and breach of oral contract without leave to amend, and, on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that appellants had failed to state a cause of action for inverse condemnation because they had not alleged a denial of all economic use of their property in a final determination of the land's permitted use, nor did they show that respondent's conduct had diminished their property value. The court also found that appellants had not demonstrated their detrimental reliance on respondent's promises, thereby precluding a claim for promissory estoppel. Since there was not contract between the parties, the court found no breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, nor was there a tort duty to appellants either from Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mobile home park owners appealed a Superior Court of San Diego County (California) judgment that dismissed plaintiffs' action against defendant city challenging a rent control ordinance. Plaintiffs asked the appellate court to reconsider its prior holding that such ordinances did not amount to a compensable &quot;taking&quot; within the meaning of U.S. Const. amend. V and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, in light of a recent federal court opinion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff mobile home park owners filed suit against defendant city challenging the constitutionality of a mobile home rent control ordinance on its face and seeking compensation for the interest that they alleged had been taken. The trial court sustained defendant's demurrer to the complaint and dismissed the action. On appeal, plaintiffs asked the appeals court to reconsider its prior holding that such ordinances did not amount to a compensable &quot;taking&quot; within the meaning of the U.S. Const. amend. V and Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 19, in light of a recent federal court opinion. The court affirmed. The court noted that a rent control ordinance is a valid exercise of the police power if it is reasonably calculated to eliminate excessive rents and provide landlords with a just and reasonable return of their property. The court further ruled that when government acts to restore fair rents by imposing rent control, the fact that the price of used mobile homes rises has not unreasonably &quot;taken&quot; anything from the landlord or caused a &quot;permanent physical occupation&quot; of the landlord's property. The court reasoned that landlords were not required to rent their property to mobile home owners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The appeals court affirmed the trial court judgment dismissing plaintiff mobile home park owners' challenge to a mobile home rent control ordinance. The court ruled that the ordinance did not amount to a compensable &quot;taking,&quot; even though mobile home prices increased after passage of the ordinance, because there was no showing that the ordinance reduced rents more than required for purposes of defendant city's police power.</SPAN></P>

The trial court entered judgment for respondent, and appellant sought review of the decision. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of petty theft with a prior theft-related conviction and a third count of burglary of the second degree, along with all enhancements. The prosecution alleged an enhancement under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 12022.1 on the count III burglary charge because it occurred while defendant was released from custody on counts I and II. A prior prison term enhancement under &sect; 667.5(b) was alleged for a 1979 burglary conviction. This was the same prior conviction alleged as a part of the charges in counts I and II. The court found no violation in the use of defendant's 1979 burglary conviction as a basis for increasing his petty thefts to felonies and in enhancing his sentence under &sect; 667.5(b). Defendant's argument that &sect; 12022.1 was amended while he was a fugitive was without merit. The act of burglarizing an establishment, from which count III arose, occurred long after the new statute's effective date and triggered its application. The court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter to the trial court for a statement of reasons for the consecutive sentence on count II.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant patient, committed to a state hospital after a jury verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Marin County (California), which upheld the constitutionality of Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 7275, insofar as it required appellant to be responsible for the costs of her institutional care, support, and maintenance.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In response to respondent Department of Developmental Services' attempt to obtain payment for the medical services rendered appellant patient, committed to a state hospital after a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, appellant brought suit and claimed that the statute providing for payment violated equal protection. Appellant's argument was that imprisoned inmates were treated differently, since a statute provided that their medical treatment would be paid for by the state, and this disparity was illegal. In affirming the judgment of the lower court, the court found that there was a rational basis for both statutes. The statute governing individuals committed to state hospitals was of principal benefit to the patient; while society also benefited from the commitment, this benefit was secondary to that derived by the patient. Also, those individuals, since they have not been convicted of a crime, have a lesser degree of stigma attached to their commitment than do prison inmates. On the other hand, the state could rationally decide that once it sent an individual to prison, it would bear the cost of incarceration, including the medical care of the inmate.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, holding that there was a rational basis for the statute which required individuals who had been found not guilty by reason of insanity to pay for their care, support and maintenance at state hospitals. There was also a rational basis for the statute which provided that the state would bear the costs of medical treatment for prison inmates. Thus, there was no equal protection violation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) developed a drug testing program in response to concern about the use of drugs in college athletics. Students were required to sign consent forms at the start of each school year or they were rendered ineligible to compete. Plaintiffs, student athletes at Stanford University, filed a complaint alleging that the program violated their right to privacy under Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment permanently enjoining defendant from enforcing the program against Stanford students. The court first found that the NCAA, a private, voluntary association of institutions, was subject to the limitations of Cal. Const. art. I, &sect; 1. The court then found that the NCAA policy violated that constitutional provision because the testing procedures were not related to the alleged purposes of the requirements conferring the benefit of association participation, the program's utility did not manifestly outweigh the infringement on the students' rights to privacy, and there were less offensive alternatives to the program.</SPAN></P>

The trial court held for plaintiff and awarded a tax refund and attorney's fees.

However, the court held that products sold by plaintiff were &quot;pesticides&quot; subject to defendant's regulatory and taxation authority under &sect; 12751, and the tax assessed on those products was not arbitrary, unreasonable, or unconstitutional. Plaintiff was not entitled to attorney's fees under Cal.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, water district and its board members, challenged the system that allowed each landowner to vote in proportion to the assessed value of his or her land holdings in elections to select the water district's board of directors. The lower court rejected appellants' constitutional challenge. The issue on appeal was whether the purpose of the water district was sufficiently specialized and narrow, and its activities bearing on landowners so disproportionately, as to distinguish the district from public entities whose more general governmental functions demanded application of the one person, one vote rule. The court found that the water district possessed some attributes of a governmental entity but concluded that the principle of one person, one vote was inapplicable to the district. The court found a rational basis for the restricted franchise because the state legislature could have concluded that the number of landowners with sufficient amounts of acreage whose consent was necessary to organize the water district would not have subjected their land to the lien of its possibly very substantial assessments unless they had a dominant voice in its control.</SPAN></P>

Defendants alleged numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct, trial court misconduct, and biased evidentiary rulings. The court stated that the overzealous prosecutors who, in their blind quest to convict, forgot or ignored their constitutional and ethical duties and were guilty of gross misconduct. The court found that the trial court's failure or refusal to rule on most of defendants' objections to the misconduct or to curb the prosecutors' behavior in any way had compounded the prejudicial effect of the prosecutors' misconduct. The court concluded that the sheer volume of questionable evidentiary rulings indicated that the strength of the state's evidence had probably not succeeded in overcoming the prejudicial effect of the misconduct.

The court denied the writs and held that proposition 57 was valid, that it did not impair any contractual rights of petitioners in violation U.S. Const. art. III, &sect; 7, and that it applied to all of the petitioners.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court denied the petitions for writ of mandate because after considering proposition 57 from several perspectives, the court concluded that the proposition was valid and did not violate the contract clause of the United States Constitution. In addition, the court concluded that proposition 57 applied to all of petitioner recipients, even those who had served both as members of the legislature and as elected constitutional officers.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A bare majority of defendant county's voters approved a sales tax ordinance, Proposition A, which was adopted by defendant agency to finance the construction and operation of county justice facilities. Plaintiff taxpayers challenged the validity of the tax. The trial court declared that the tax violated the requirement of Cal. Const. art. XIII A, &sect; 4 (Proposition 13), that local special taxes be approved by a two-thirds vote. Defendants, county and agency, appealed. The court reversed, holding that the tax was valid. The court held that defendant agency did not have the power to levy a property tax and was not a special district subject to &sect; 4. The court held that Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 53722 (Proposition 62), if found applicable, would constitute a referendum on local taxing power that violated Cal. Const. art. II, &sect;&sect; 9(a) and 11, and that could not be permitted to invalidate the tax or Proposition A.

Plaintiff closed the plant and sought review of the assessment, contending that defendant should have been aware of the closure and that the cost of hazardous waste cleanup at the site should be deducted from the property value for tax purposes. The county assessment appeals board upheld the property tax valuation, but rejected the argument that the assessment should be reduced due to cleanup costs. Plaintiff filed a complaint for the recovery of taxes, pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 5140. The trial court held that substantial evidence supported the property tax valuation, but not the board's finding regarding cleanup costs. Both parties sought review. The court affirmed in part and held that the valuation was supported by substantial evidence. However, the court reversed the part of the judgment remanding for an appropriate reduction in valuation to reflect the cost of toxic cleanup because the weight of the evidence supported the conclusion that a potential purchaser would not have been aware of the contamination at the time of the assessment.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff taxpayers sought to invalidate the amended ordinance as unconstitutional. The court reversed the order which dismissed plaintiffs' action and held that the amended ordinance violated state and federal equal protection requirements and was unconstitutional because it taxed persons who resided only in certain designated types of shelter, like hotels, but not persons who resided in others such as apartments, houses, and boarding homes and because it permitted some transients to entirely escape the tax. The court found that there was no rational basis for the sub-classification of persons living in transient-type accommodations. The court also found that the subclassification was not rationally related to the achievement of legitimate government objectives because the tax paid for services for all residents who occupied housing not owned by them, whether they lived in transient housing or not, but was imposed only on only a portion of those people.</SPAN></P>

The essential characteristics of the employment relationship were the right to control and direct the activities of the person rendering service or the manner and method in which the work was performed. The court found that under the California constitution and statutes, the state retained the authority to administer, control, direct, censure, discipline, remove, retire, and admonish judges of the municipal courts.

The court determined that application of the nonrenewal restriction to the subject policies was not an unconstitutional impairment of contract. Plaintiff's claim that it was subjected to an ex post facto law was unfounded. Respondent simply ordered plaintiff to cure its violation of that section by rescinding its invalid nonrenewal notices. The court ruled that plaintiff's assertion that the nonrenewal of a policy was complete once the notice was mailed was not well-founded. The court explained that until the existing coverage expired, nonrenewal was incomplete because a contractual relationship still existed and the policy was in full force and effect. Thus, simply because a notice of nonrenewal was mailed prior to the election did not preclude application of the statute to the subject policies.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants challenged a trial judge's order granting judgment on the pleadings to appellees, municipality and municipal officials, in appellants' lawsuit seeking to overturn a municipal statute. The court affirmed. Appellees had adopted a city ordinance prohibiting the occupancy of motor homes overnight within city limits. Appellants brought a declaratory judgment action, arguing the statute unconstitutionally violated equal protection rights, inasmuch as the statute discriminated against poor people unable to afford better housing. The court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional inasmuch as it did not discriminate between poor and nonpoor. Rather, the court held, it barred both the poor and nonpoor from living in such housing during overnight hours.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lower court's judgment in favor of appellees, municipality and municipal officials, was affirmed. The municipal ordinance prohibiting residence in motor homes during overnight hours was not violative of equal protection, as it did not discriminate between the poor and the nonpoor where it barred both groups equally from residing in such vehicles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, unlicensed individual and association of accountants, sought review of the lower court's grant of an injunction to defendant State Board of Accountancy restraining them from referring to themselves or their services as &quot;accountant,&quot; and &quot;accounting services,&quot; claiming defendant could not constitutionally prohibit plaintiffs from using those terms. Plaintiffs were not licensed as public accountants and defendant alleged those terms would mislead or confuse the public. The court found that other cases involving the Accountancy Act, Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code &sect;&sect; 5000 et seq. had not considered the constitutional limitations in enjoining unlicensed persons from calling themselves accountants. Here, an independent survey was admitted into evidence showing more than 50 percent surveyed believed the terms &quot;accountant&quot; or &quot;accounting services&quot; required a license, therefore, the court held the terms standing alone were misleading and could not be utilized by unlicensed persons without a modifier, qualifier, or disclaimer. The court reversed and remanded holding the injunction must be modified to prohibit only the use of the terms &quot;accountant&quot; or &quot;accounting&quot; without a modifier.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded. Plaintiffs, an individual and association of accountants, could not be absolutely enjoined from using the terms &quot;accountant&quot; and &quot;accounting services,&quot; because the use of those terms by unlicensed individuals or organizations had to be permitted if qualified by a warning or disclaimer stating that they were not licensed or that the services did not require a license.</SPAN></P>

Appellants sought review, arguing that there were only two broad categories of poker, draw poker with no exposed cards and stud poker with exposed cards, and that &sect; 330's prohibition of stud-horse poker made illegal all forms of poker except draw poker. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court found that there were several different recognized categories of poker, each having its own distinct format and strategy, and that stud poker was but one such category. The court held that by its own explicit terms, &sect; 330 proscribed stud poker and no other category of poker games. The court further found that Texas Hold'em did not fall within the stud poker category.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Asserting that a search by private security guards which yielded LSD and marijuana was illegal, defendant appealed from the denial of his motion to suppress evidence under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1538.5(m). Defendant argued that since private individuals may not search each other for contraband under California law, the evidence was illegally seized and should be excluded. Second, he argued that since the security guards were private individuals who arrested him without complying with statutes defining how private citizens may exercise the power to arrest, the court should refuse to give binding legal effect to his consent. The court rejected defendant's arguments. The court held that the protection of U.S. Const. amend. IV did not extend to searches carried out by private persons. The court also held that the facts presented by defendant failed to establish that the state had established such an interdependence with the security guards involved in this case that it must be recognized as a joint participant in the challenged activity. The court held that substantial evidence supported the finding of the trial court. Accordingly, the court affirmed the decision of the trial court.</SPAN></P>

The court determined that there was no per se prohibition against a police agreement to pay an informant for undercover services upon a condition that the informant testify at a criminal trial. The court concluded that the plea agreement, which called for information, not testimony, did not contravene public policy. Thus, the plea agreement was valid and enforceable. The court determined that any Marsden error, which did not go to the legality of the proceedings resulting in the plea was waived by defendant's guilty plea.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, minor and parents, brought an action for damages against respondents, county and social workers, under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, alleging that respondents wrongfully removed appellant minor from the custody of appellant parents upon a misdiagnosis of sexual abuse, and further alleging that respondents kept her from the custody of appellant parents by placing her in foster care for seven weeks. The trial court entered judgment ordering the action dismissed without leave to amend. Appellants sought review of the decision. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment. The court held that respondent social workers enjoyed absolute immunity from suits alleging the improper investigation of child abuse, removal of a minor from the parental home based upon suspicion of abuse, and the instigation of dependency proceedings. The court held that because a local government could not be sued under &sect; 1983 for an injury caused solely by its employees or agents, and appellants had not alleged an injury inflicted by the execution of respondent county's policies, appellants had failed to state a cause of action against respondent county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of Riverside County (California), after a jury found defendant guilty of committing a lewd act with a child under 14 in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect; 288(a), and found that he had engaged in substantial sexual conduct as referenced in Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1203.066(a)(8). Defendant claimed error in the admission of evidence and testimony, and in failing to instruct the jury on a lesser offense.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of committing a lewd act with a child under 14, and was found to have engaged in substantial sexual conduct. The court ruled that California law did not require corroboration of the testimony of a child sexual abuse victim, that the victim was qualified to testify notwithstanding his age, and that the victim's testimony was sufficient evidence to convict defendant. The court found that proof of penetration or of ejaculation was not required in a sexual assault case, and that evidence of the victim's past sexual conduct was properly excluded as irrelevant. The court sustained the judgment of the trial court, and ruled that the testimony of a previously undisclosed expert was admissible on rebuttal. The court held that to give an instruction on a lesser offense, there must have been some basis, other than an unexplainable rejection of prosecution evidence, on which the jury could have found the offense to be less than that charged. The court found that there was no lesser offense, because if the jury did not believe the testimony of the victim, it should have acquitted defendant.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court determined that no error was committed by the trial court in its admission of certain evidence and in its selection of jury instructions. The court affirmed defendant's conviction for committing a lewd act with a child under 14.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant state employee claimed that he was performing duties at a higher civil service level but was not compensated, so appellant filed a grievance requesting a wage settlement for the out-of -class work. The grievance was denied, and appellant sought review of the denial to respondent department of personnel administration, which also denied the claim. Appellant then petitioned for writ of mandamus with the trial court. The trial court sustained respondents' demurrer, holding that appellant had not exhausted his remedies and that out-of-class compensation claims did not invoke the merit principle as set out in Cal. Const. art VII, &sect;&sect; 1-3. Appellant sought review, arguing that respondent department of personnel administration lacked jurisdiction. The court affirmed, holding that judicial review of appellant's claims was precluded because appellant had not exhausted his administrative remedies. The court also held that respondent department of personnel administration was explicitly granted jurisdiction to hear out-of-class compensation claims by Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 19818.16, and that the statute was not unconstitutional because it was only a personnel administration procedure.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was found to be mentally retarded and a danger to himself and others and involuntarily committed. On appeal, the court reversed the order recommitting defendant and remanded for further proceedings, holding that due process and equal protection required that the trial record show defendant was advised of the right to a jury trial before adjudicating a Cal. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code &sect; 6500 proceeding because defendant was being deprived of personal liberty, and there was no compelling reason for the statutorily provided disparate treatment between two classes of persons with mental deficiencies on the advisement issue. The court declined to make the advisement requirement retroactive as retroactivity would have seriously disturbed the administration of justice. The court found that &sect; 6500's failure to define &quot;dangerousness&quot; for all individuals within its scope was not fatal to its constitutionality given that &sect; 6500 could have utilized the meaning of &quot;danger&quot; from another statute enacted for a similar purpose. The court ruled that the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence for commitment was moot as the periods for the holding and recommitment orders had expired.</SPAN></P>

Appellant applied for guardianship. Respondent's summary judgment motion was granted and the guardianship terminated. On appeal, the court affirmed both orders because appellant was estopped from arguing he was the legal father, and appellant abandoned his guardianship appeal. To determine whether appellant was entitled to appointed counsel in the UPA action, the court balanced the interests involved, the possible consequences of an erroneous adjudication, and the nature of the proceedings against the state's interests. None of these factors supported a right to counsel finding. The court affirmed the grant of respondent's summary judgment motion, finding that appellant was estopped from making parental claims because at all times preceding the UPA action, appellant told the child and others that respondent was the natural father, and the child believed appellant and formed parental bonds with respondent.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of two counts of first degree burglary, one count of auto theft, and one prior prison term allegation. He claimed that the trial court committed reversible error by admitting his confession which was improperly obtained after he invoked his Miranda rights. The court reversed and held that if an individual indicated in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wished to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. Defendant indicated early on during the interview with detectives, after he was advised he would be extradited to California, that he would &quot;save it for when I get there,&quot; yet the interview continued, and he finally confessed. The court ruled that the detectives had not &quot;scrupulously&quot; honored defendant's request to terminate the interrogation, and therefore the confession violated Miranda. Under California law, improper introduction of a confession constituted reversible error per se, even though federal law allowed application of the harmless error standard, which in defendant's case, would have resulted in defendant's conviction notwithstanding the illegal confession.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's convictions because detectives violated his Miranda rights in continuing to question him after he indicated he no longer wished to talk.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a judgment, preliminary injunction, and several orders in favor of defendants, entered in the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco (California), asserting that the superior court abused its discretion in issuing an injunction restraining him from renting rooms to tourists except during a designated tourist season, and then refusing to dissolve the injunction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff owned residential hotel units that he wished to rent to tourists. Defendant city enacted the San Francisco Residential Hotel Unit Conversion and Demolition Ordinance, San Francisco Admin. Code ch. 41, in an attempt to limit the conversion of residential hotel units for use by tourists except during the tourist season. The ordinance provided that owners could not exit the residential housing business without obtaining a conversion permit, which was granted only if the owner made a one-for-one replacement of the units by certain methods. The trial court entered an injunction prohibiting plaintiff from using the units for tourists. The court affirmed the judgment against plaintiff except on his claim under 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983, finding that although his pleading on this claim may have been insufficient, a consideration of the entire record cured any problems. The court reversed the injunction, finding the ordinance preempted by the Ellis Act, Cal. Gov't Code &sect;&sect; 7060-7060.7. Because the ordinance required landlords to do more than was required under the Ellis Act to get out of the residential housing business, it was invalid as applied to that extent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment against plaintiff, except to the extent it held that plaintiff had no civil rights damages action because any defect in plaintiff's pleading on this issue was cured by the entire record. However, the court reversed the order granting the injunction and the other orders, finding the city ordinance prohibiting landlords from going out of the residential housing business preempted and partially invalid.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff boatowners sought review of a decision from the Superior Court of San Diego County (California), dismissing on defendant attorneys' demurrer plaintiffs' complaint seeking to enjoin the San Diego Unified Port District from appointing defendants as deputy district attorneys to prosecute Port District ordinance violations.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff boatowners challenged the trial court's dismissal on demurrer of plaintiffs' petition to enjoin defendant attorneys from being employed by the San Diego Unified Port District as deputy district attorneys to prosecute Port District ordinance violations. Plaintiffs objected to Port District ordinances adopted in 1986, which prohibited anchorages in certain parts of San Diego Bay. When plaintiffs failed to move their boats from the prohibited anchorages, plaintiffs were served with misdemeanor citations. In a separate civil action, plaintiffs had failed in their attempt to have the ordinances declared unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the Port Authority was authorized by Cal. Harb. &amp; Nav. Code &sect; 22, 35, and 55 to regulate anchorages and enforce rules governing the use of navigable waters. Under Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 24101, the district attorney was empowered to appoint defendants as deputies in order to discharge the district attorney's enforcement duties under Cal. Harb. &amp; Nav. Code &sect; 59. Therefore, the Port Authority was permitted to pay defendants in their capacity as deputy district attorneys. The court affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intoxicated defendant killed one victim and attempted to kill a second individual. He was convicted of first degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 187 and attempted murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 664, 187 with a firearm in violation of Cal. Penal Code &sect;12022.5 and, after an appeal, he was convicted a second time. On second appeal, the court affirmed and specified the conviction for attempted murder as second degree by operation of law, holding that voluntary intoxication was not available under current California law as a way to reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter. The court determined that, under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 22, 25, and 29, the defense of diminished capacity had been abolished, returning California to a &quot;strict mens rea&quot; approach when dealing with voluntary intoxication. Therefore, the trial court was not required sua sponte to give instructions relating intoxication to each crime level. The court concluded that the state was not precluded by double jeopardy from using evidence of the second degree attempted murder to prove the first degree murder when the second degree was applied by operation of law under Cal. Penal Code &sect; 1157, not by a factual jury acquittal.</SPAN></P>

After the trial court denied appellant's motions for a nonsuit and directed verdict, the jury returned a general verdict in respondent's favor. Appellant sought review.

Nor could a favorable termination reflecting innocence be inferred from other elements of malicious prosecution. Moreover, error in instructing on malicious prosecution was prejudicial, which required retrial as to remaining counts.

Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11379.6(a). Defendant alleged that the trial court improperly denied his pretrial motion to suppress evidence that was obtained through an unconstitutional search and seizure within the meaning of the U.S. Const. amend.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction for manufacturing methamphetamine (meth) under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code &sect; 11379.6(a), arguing that videotape surveillance of and confiscation of items from the condominium where he manufactured the meth constituted an unconstitutional search and seizure and that a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) informant did not have nor reasonably appear to have authority to consent to the search. Although the informant was found to be a cotenant, the court noted that the evidence showed he telephoned and rang the doorbell before giving his consent when defendant and his associate were present. Under these circumstances, the court held that it was reasonable for defendant to entertain a subjective expectation of privacy in the premises. The court held that the communications recorded and transmitted to the DEA via the video cameras would have been valid only so long as the informant was a party to them, aural or visual. The court reversed and remanded the matter for the trial court to determine whether the consensual physical entry into the condominium was tainted by the earlier illegal video surveillance and, if so, what evidence had to be suppressed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant tax assessors appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), which granted declaratory relief to plaintiff taxpayer by holding that only 50 percent of plaintiff's property was subject to reassessment for a change in ownership.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer owned half of a corporation that owned a building. The corporation conveyed an undivided one-half interest in the building each to plaintiff and a third party. Later that day, the third party conveyed his interest to plaintiff. Plaintiff sought declaratory relief from a reassessment, contending that only half of the property was subject to reassessment for change of ownership. The trial court found for plaintiff. On appeal, the court affirmed. Under Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 1605.5, the trial court properly conducted a trial de novo because plaintiff challenged the method of valuation used to determine that a change in ownership occurred. Independent economic reasons for both transfers of the property made the step doctrine inapplicable. Defendant tax assessors' unwritten guideline, that the step transaction doctrine should apply to such transfers if both conveyances occurred less than six months apart, was arbitrary and was used in violation of Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 11347.5 because the guideline was unpublished. Attorney's fees were properly awarded pursuant to Cal. Rev. &amp; Tax. Code &sect; 5152.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed a declaratory judgment against defendant tax assessors, which held that plaintiff taxpayer's building was only subject to a 50 percent reassessment for a change in ownership. The court concluded that the step doctrine was inapplicable and that plaintiff was entitled to attorney's fees under the governing statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a general election, voters approved two initiatives regarding public financing of elections. Since Proposition 73 which prohibited the use of public money in all political campaigns received the greater number of votes, under Cal. Const. art. II, &sect; 10(b) that proposition prevailed. As a result a section was added to the Political Reform Act, Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 81000 et seq. The new section was Cal. Gov't Code &sect; 853008(1988). Petitioner political action groups then filed a petition for writ of mandate, seeking a determination that Cal. Gov't. Code &sect; 85300 was unconstitutional. The court denied the petition finding that &sect; 8530 was enacted by vote of the majority of voters in an election. The California Constitution did not vest exclusive authority over the financing of political campaign in the legislature. Moreover, no express demands or prohibitions were made as a result of &sect; 85300, it just forbid the expenditure or use of public monies for the purpose of seeking elective office.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After a jury found him guilty of second degree murder, appellant sought review of his conviction by the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) contending that the trial court should have ordered a new trial once it learned that his brother had confessed to the crime. Appellant petitioned for habeas corpus on the ground that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant was convicted of second degree murder in the shooting death of a victim related by marriage. On appeal, the court rejected appellant's claim that the trial court on its own motion should have ordered a new trial when it learned that appellant's brother had confessed to firing the fatal shot because the trial court lacked that authority and appellant's counsel chose against making the motion. On appellant's petition for habeas corpus based on ineffective assistance of counsel, the court adopted the findings from the reference hearing that allegations of the incompetency of counsel were speculative and that there was no likelihood of a more favorable result to appellant based on his attorney's conduct. The court found acceptable reasons why counsel did not seek admission of statements by appellant's brother including the negation of the alibi defense, the statements' inconsistencies, the likelihood of perjury, and the possibility that the jury would find appellant guilty of abetting the murder if it believed the brother's statement. Concluding that appellant did not prove ineffective counsel, the court affirmed his conviction and denied his petition for habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

The court dismissed appellant's petition for habeas corpus because he did not show his counsel was ineffective for not seeking admission of the brother's statements that would have negated the alibi defense and could have been perjurious.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant murderer challenged a conviction from the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California), for second degree murder, Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187 and 189, based upon appellant's contentions that the jury instructions were improper, the prosecutorial comments appealed to the jury's passion, use of a victim impact statement in the probation report during sentencing was error, and there was ineffective assistance of counsel.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At appellant murderer's second trial, appellant was represented by new counsel who refused to allow appellant's brother to testify that he shot and killed the victim. Appellant's conviction of second degree murder under Cal. Penal Code &sect;&sect; 187 and 189, was affirmed. The trial court properly gave Cal. Jury Instructions -Criminal No. 2.11.5 (4th ed. 1979), that the jury, in deciding appellant's fate, not consider why any other person was not being prosecuted or whether such person could be. Prosecutorial comments relating to victim's wounds were proper as those comments went to explaining a basis for witness misidentification of appellant as the shooter, and in any event the issue was waived for failing to object at trial.  Cal. Evid. Code &sect; 353. Use of victim impact statement in a probation report was specifically permitted under Cal. R. Ct. 419. Appellant's counsel's decision to not use the brother's confession was not ineffective assistance of counsel when the confession could obliterate the complete alibi defense already presented and there was the potential that the confession was manufactured. Thus, appellant failed to meet his burden of proof by preponderance of the evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed appellant murderer's conviction because the jury instructions were a correct statement of the law, the prosecutor did not appeal to jury passion during closing arguments, court rules authorized the use of victim impact statements in probation reports at sentencing, and appellant's counsel was not ineffective.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant stevedoring companies filed suit for inverse condemnation after respondents, city and county, denied appellants' building permit on land owned by one appellant and leased to the other. The trial court sustained respondents' demurrer, dismissed appellants' action for failure to state a cause of action, and stayed discovery in the matter. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment and held that appellants did not state a cause of action for inverse condemnation or pre-condemnation damages. There was no allegation in the complaint that either respondent had commenced negotiations with appellants or made any effort to purchase the property, or had made any statements indicating a present intention to acquire the property by condemnation or otherwise. There is no allegation in the complaint that appellants challenged the denial of their building permit, either by appeal to the city's board of permit appeals or by petitioning for a writ of mandate in superior court. As appellants themselves made clear, no condemnation had taken place, and respondents had never taken any steps to commence eminent domain proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The dismissal of appellant stevedoring companies' complaint was affirmed because the facts alleged in the complaint failed to indicate that respondents, city and county, had done anything with respect to appellants' property beyond the planning stage, and the denial of appellants' building permit and respondents' subsequent delay in acquiring the property did not amount to a taking.</SPAN></P>

Appellant argued that the trial court erred when it denied her motion to dismiss a petition filed by respondent, Butte County Child Protective Services, which alleged, among other things, that her son was born under the influence of opiates.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Shortly after appellant mother gave birth to her son, he displayed symptoms consistent with drug withdrawal.

Code &sect; 300, that the minor's parents were unable to provide for his care, custody, and control due to their substance abuse problems. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss the petition, which the trial court denied. The trial court found that the minor was subject to its jurisdiction, declared him to be a dependent child of the juvenile court, and placed him with his paternal grandparents. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of appellant's motion to dismiss the petition. The court held that the facts alleged in the petition were legally sufficient to state a cause of action to have the minor declared a dependent of the juvenile court since the petition concisely described his medical condition at birth, that his parents had a longstanding substance abuse problem, and that they were unable to provide for his care, custody, and control.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained respondent's demurrer and dismissed him from the case. Appellant challenged the trial court's judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed, holding that the decision to eliminate the requirement that the Chief Justice be chairman of the board of trustees did not violate the law school's autonomy guarantees pursuant to Cal. Const. art. IV, &sect; 9, because the matter of limiting the Chief Justice's outside responsibilities was of statewide concern and because there was no impairment to the board of trustees and no harm to the educational decisions of the institution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent mobile home park owner enacted a rule restricting residency to people 55 or older and included a grandfather clause for tenants under 55 at the time of the enactment. Appellant tenants, each of whom had children born after the age rule was enacted, were evicted. Respondent then brought an unlawful detainer action against appellants and was granted summary judgment. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the age rule did not violate constitutional proscriptions, as the rule was neither arbitrary nor irrational and served an important purpose in meeting the needs of senior citizens. The court held that the rule also did not violate relevant state statutes, observing that amendments to the Unruh Civil Rights Act, Cal. Civ. Code &sect; 51 et seq., specifically excluded mobile home parks from its broad antidiscrimination policy. The age rule did not violate the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, as the rule fell within the exception for &quot;housing for older persons&quot; in which discrimination on the basis of familial status was not prohibited pursuant to 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 3706(b)(1).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff transit district filed suit against defendant transit district's secretary to compel validation of two special benefit assessment districts created to fund the transit system. Defendant refused to certify the resolutions on the ground that Cal. Pub. Util.

The trial court found that the districts had been validly created and granted a writ of mandate directing defendant to certify the resolution. The court reversed the order and held that the statute was violative of constitutional equal protection. There was no relationship between votes awarded and assessments paid. Nonlandowners shared an equal interest in the creation of a transit system, and voters who did not own property could not have been constitutionally excluded from voting on bonds. The benefits and burdens of the assessment fell indiscriminately on property owner and nonproperty owner alike. The election provisions of the statute were not separable; therefore, the statutory scheme in its entirety was unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to plaintiff hotel owner's purchase of a hotel, defendant city enacted an ordinance prohibiting the conversion of any residential hotel unit into a unit intended for the use of transient overnight guests and denied plaintiff's application for an exemption.

The trial court granted intervenor hotel tenants association's motion for judgment on the pleadings and awarded intervenor's attorney fees. The court held that the decision of the first trial court was res judicata as to all issues except plaintiff's new 42 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1983 claim. The court held that it was error for the trial court to grant intervenor's motion for judgment on the pleadings as to plaintiff's &sect; 1983 claim because the claim alleged actions by defendant such as &quot;spot-zoning,&quot; retaliation, administrative deficiency, and a denial of equal protection.

Defendant's argument that &sect; 17043 was preempted by the Sherman Antitrust Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1 et seq., was rejected, because an inference of preemption was inappropriate where the basic purposes of the state and federal statutes were similar.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician sought review of the decision of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County (California) which entered judgment and damages against appellant for medical malpractice and intentional infliction of emotional distress pursuant to a jury verdict in an action brought by respondent, patient's conservator.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant physician challenged the judgment and damages entered by the trial court for medical malpractice and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Appellant claimed that his conduct was not outrageous, that the claims were for parental consortium, and that the patient was incapable of knowing that she was being injured. The court affirmed the judgment and damage award because appellant's conduct was outrageous and done with a conscious disregard for the consequences, patient was capable of acknowledging the harm, and the punitive damage award was reasonable. The court held that appellant was responsible for the patient's care, chose to disregard patient's physical well-being, and failed to take even the simplest measure to ascertain her status or protect patient from the inevitable. Appropriate medical care would have prevented patient's injuries. The court held that patient's injuries were those regularly held recoverable, as the claims were based on appellant's numerous and egregious failures. The record was replete with evidence from which evidence of malice was reasonably inferred and supported the punitive damages award.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment and damages award because the evidence was clear that appellant physician's action were outrageous and malicious, and appellant consciously disregarded the consequences of his failure to adequately perform responsibly with regard to the patient.</SPAN></P>
