While driving them home, defendant drove up behind the man while he was stopped at a light. The girlfriend asked the man to pull over so that she could talk to defendant. Defendant got out of his car and walked over to the man's car. Defendant had a gun, and he shot the man in the head, killing him. The women testified that the man was unarmed. Defendant pleaded self-defense. He testified that the man had slid across the car seat and was coming up with a gun. On appeal, defendant argued that the trial court erred in granting the State's request for a jury instruction on manslaughter because the instruction improperly shifted the burden of proof to defendant. The court found that on the evidence it was proper for the trial court to submit to the jury instructions defining both murder and manslaughter, which was done. The definition of manslaughter in the criticized instruction was neither incorrect nor misleading and stated with sufficient clarity the burden of proof that must be met by the State in order to justify conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On the day of the subject incident, a victim was killed during an armed robbery of her store. Defendant was consequently convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death. The views expressed in a specified other case required a reversal and a remand for further proceedings consistent with the opinion in that case. Among the other alleged errors, defendant contended that Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 43-21-39 (1972) unconstitutionally gave the circuit court uncontrolled discretion to remand the case to the youth court so defendant might be dealt with as a delinquent minor. The court rejected the argument. Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 43-21-31 provided that the circuit court had exclusive jurisdiction of such children if charged with any crime which, upon conviction, was punishable by life imprisonment or death. Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 97-3-19(2)(e) (Supp. 1976) provided for imposition of a death sentence or life imprisonment, so the circuit court was without power to transfer the case. The court also held that evidence of an earlier unsuccessful attempt to rob the victim's store was admissible to show that defendant had not abandoned his criminal purpose.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted in the Circuit Court of Calhoun County (Mississippi) of capital murder under Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 97-3-19(2)(e) (Supp. 1976) and he was sentenced to death. On appeal, the issues included whether, after defendant pled insanity, the trial court took appropriate action to determine criminal responsibility and whether the jury was properly instructed on the issue.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant's motion that he be transferred to the Mississippi State Hospital for psychiatric examination was overruled, and, instead, the trial court ordered him examined by a psychiatrist at a mental health clinic. One of defendant's attorneys testified that defendant was completely unable to communicate with him and was incapable of helping his attorneys prepare a rational defense. The doctor and a jailer testified that defendant knew the difference between right and wrong. However, the doctor also recommended that defendant be examined at a state hospital. Defendant's renewed motion to that effect was overruled. On appeal, the court held the overruling of the motion constituted reversible error. The court instructed that, before retrial, defendant should be sent to a state hospital or otherwise afforded an appropriate and adequate determination of his sanity and mental competency. The court rejected an argument that the M'Naghten Rule be abandoned. The court directed that, on retrial, the jury instructions authorized by Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 99-13-7 (1972) be given. The court rejected defendant's argument that the Mississippi capital murder statutes were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The driver was injured as the result of an automobile collision that she had with a vehicle driven by the deputy sheriff. The driver had filed a personal injury complaint against the sheriff and his surety. The complaint alleged that the deputy sheriff was performing his official duties when the collision occurred. The trial court sustained the demurrer of the sheriff and the surety to the personal injury complaint. On appeal, the court held that where an official duty was to be performed, and when the sheriff placed an automobile at the disposal of his deputy, as an instrumentality to be used by him in the performance of such duty, and the latter used such instrumentality unlawfully so that it injured a person in the course of such use, there was official misconduct within the meaning of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 19-25-19 (1972). The court concluded that the complaint had stated a cause of action against the sheriff, but not against the surety. The court held that the surety could not be liable on a sheriff's bond for the negligent acts of the deputy sheriff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment that sustained the sheriff's demurrer to the personal injury complaint filed by the driver.

After a jury trial, defendant was convicted and sentenced to death. On appeal, the court reversed the conviction and ordered a new trial. The court held that: (1) the trial court misapplied Mississippi's death penalty statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-21, by requiring a mandatory sentence of death upon defendant's conviction on charges of murder and attempted rape; (2) construing the statute in a way to save it from a declaration of unconstitutionality,&nbsp;&sect; 97-3-21 required that persons convicted of capital murder must be sentenced by the court to death if that was the verdict of the jury after defendant was accorded a trial governed by procedures and guidelines designed to prevent the risk that the death penalty would be inflicted in an arbitrary, capricious, or freakish manner; (3) cases involving the death penalty required a bifurcated trial in which aggravating and mitigating factors must be considered at a sentencing hearing; and (4) meaningful appellate review required a comparison of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances present in other similar cases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The injured party sustained injuries when a television antenna he was moving came into contact with an overhead electrical distribution line. He brought a personal injury action against the power company. The district court entered a judgment in his favor. The power company appealed. The court reversed and remanded for a new trial, holding that the district court erroneously selected a jury after the case had been removed to federal court and before it was remanded. Because the district court had no jurisdiction to impanel the jury after the case was removed, the jury was impaneled without authority of law and the verdict rendered by it was a nullity. The court also held that the venue statute,&nbsp;Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 11-11-5 (1972), which permitted suits against power companies in any county in which a company had a power line, was not unconstitutional because all power companies were treated equally under the statute. The power company was not entitled to a peremptory instruction because the issues of whether it should have protected against the likelihood of contact by the injured party and whether it should have issued a warning were issues of fact for determination by a jury.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The City desired to annex 52.13 square miles, and it adopted an ordinance on August 27, 1974 defining the subject lands under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 21-1-27 (1972). The City then petitioned the chancery court for a decree ratifying the proposed enlargement of its boundaries. After a hearing, the chancellor confirmed the ordinance as to about 40 square miles. On appeal, the objectors argued that &sect; 21-1-27 violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States because it denied to the qualified electors the right to vote on the matter. The court found that the right of a municipality acting under &sect; 21-1-27 to extend its boundaries without the consent of those living within the path of the extension had been upheld as constitutional. No showing of discrimination was made. Also, the testimony showed that the City had a sewage treatment plant with adequate capacity to take care of the needs of the people in the subject area. The City could provide needed police and fire protection and better lighting, recreational facilities, and garbage pickup than the annexed area currently had.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed an ordinance, which prohibited large establishments from selling food, garden, and lawn supplies on Sunday, and which prohibited all sales in the morning hours on Sunday. The operators of the food stores filed an action to enjoin the city from enforcing the ordinance. The trial court issued a permanent injunction. The court reversed on appeal. The court first noted that Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 97-23-67 (1972) prohibited sales on Sunday, except for food, garden, and lawn supplies, but that Code &sect; 97-23-75 authorized municipals to further limit sales. The court held that the city's ordinance was authorized by the statutes. The court held that the limitation on the size of establishments was a reasonable method of accomplishing the limitation of the sale of food and was a proper means adopted by the city to give effect to powers expressly granted. The court next rejected the operators' argument that the ordinance violated the principle of equal protection. The court held that the classification did not discriminate, particularly because any competition that the small stores could give to the larger ones was minimal.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Town of Flowood filed a petition for approval of an annexation ordinance in the Chancery Court of Rankin County (Mississippi) and made two cities defendants pursuant to Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 21-1-31 (1972). The chancery court rejected appellant City of Jackson's objection, and modified and approved the ordinance. The City appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Town adopted an ordinance, which extended its boundaries. The extension involved the addition of four separate areas to the existing limits of Flowood. The City was the sole protestant to the proposed annexation. The Town did not present any evidence as to the reasonableness to two areas of the annexation and, consequently, the chancery court deleted those two portions from the annexation. The court held that Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 21-1-33 (1972) gave the annexation procedure flexibility. The court rejected the City's contention that the expansion proceeding was void because the Town failed to afford the City the right to an evidentiary hearing or notice on the issue of public convenience and necessity. The court noted that the portion of &sect; 21-1-33 requiring the chancery court to determine the issue of public convenience and necessity had previously been declared unconstitutional. The issue was a legislative question to be decided by the Town's governing board and the City was not entitled to a hearing or notice. Finally, the court found substantial evidence to support the finding that the expansion, as modified, was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

The defense was grounded on the theory of insanity. The issue, inter alia, was whether inculpatory statements defendant made to a court-appointed psychiatrist with reference to events surrounding the crime charged were admissible.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that when he had a mental evaluation, a grand jury could not hear evidence on the charge until the examination was made. The court rejected the contention, stating that a grand jury was not charged with inquiring into an accused's mental condition. Although a psychiatrist testified that he used other's reports in deciding that defendant was sane, there was no contemporaneous objection. In fact, defendant's counsel extensively cross-examined the psychiatrist and introduced reports to which he referred which were favorable to defendant, who did not move to exclude the testimony until after several intervening witnesses and the resting of the State's case. Inculpatory statements defendant made to a court-appointed psychiatrist on events surrounding the crime were inadmissible. However, there was no reversible error because the statements were contrary to the account of the shooting in defendant's confession, which was admitted into evidence after finding beyond a reasonable doubt that it was freely and voluntarily given. Admitting the statements was harmless error. It was not necessary for a technician administering routine tests to be a licensed psychologist.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An indictment charged defendant of committing a &quot;crime against nature&quot; by having intercourse with a man. Defendant filed a motion to quash the indictment. The trial court granted the motion after finding that the statutory allegations of the indictment were vague, ambiguous, indefinite, and uncertain. The court reversed on appeal. The court held that Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 99-7-1 (1972) allowed for an indictment to be charged according to common law or statute. In this case, the court found that the indictment described and charged the crime of sodomy according to the statute,&nbsp;Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 97-29-59 (1972), and to the common law. The court held that both prohibited a &quot;crime against nature.&quot; The court held that the phrase &quot;crime against nature&quot; was not vague, but that defendant had fair warning and could understand what was proscribed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A democratic primary election was held for the position of district supervisor on August 26, 1975. The nominee had two more votes than the candidate did and the vote was certified on August 27, 1975. The candidate indicated that he would examine the ballot boxes on September 1, 1975. An examination, however, was delayed until September 8, 1975. On September 24, 1975, the candidate filed a formal contest of the election results. The county democratic executive committee declined to hear the contest on the ground that it was not timely. The candidate filed a petition for judicial review and a special tribunal affirmed the committee's action. The court affirmed on appeal. The court held that &sect; 3143, Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated required that a contest had to be filed within 20 days of the primary election. The court held the statute was not repealed by &sect; 34, Chapter 506, Laws of 1970 because &sect; 34 never became effective because the Attorney General of the United States did not approve it, as required by the Voting Rights Act. The court held, therefore, that the timing requirement of &sect; 3143, Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated still applied.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed the conviction, contending that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad. The court reversed. The court held that &sect; 97-29-33 was overbroad because it prohibited freedom of speech in areas beyond the permissible limits set forth by the United States Supreme Court. The court held that using a statutory definition of &quot;obscene, indecent or immoral&quot; in viewing moving pictures tread upon the freedom of speech requirements set forth by the Supreme Court and was an unconstitutional trespass upon the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court declined to authoritatively construe the statute to constitutional proportions by reading into it the required specificity and limitations.

Code Ann. &sect; 97-3-19(2)(a) (Supp. 1974) for the killing of a deputy sheriff who was acting in his official capacity. The evidence indicated that defendant was an inmate in the county jail at the time of the killing. On appeal, defendant argued that the circuit court erred in overruling his motion to quash the indictment on the ground that the punishment provided in the statute was cruel and inhuman in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Defendant further alleged that it was error to not appoint a psychiatrist to examine whether he was mentally competent to stand trial. The court reversed and remanded the case for another trial, holding that because there was a reasonable probability that defendant was incapable of making a rational defense, the circuit court erred in failing to sustain defendant's motion to have a psychiatrist appointed. The court further concluded that the venue should have been changed to another county.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant superintendent of education sought review of two separate actions heard by the Circuit Court of Smith County (Mississippi), in which the circuit court affirmed the action of appellee Smith County Board of Supervisors in granting a 25-year lease of 96 acres of sixteenth section lands to a third party and in granting a 25-year lease of 15 acres of sixteenth section lands to another third party. The Board cross-appealed from the order.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The superintendent contended that the Board breached its duty as trustee of the sixteenth section lands by leasing these lands for the yearly sum of 40 cents per acre, which he contended was only a nominal charge. The court held that a determination of whether the annual rental of 40 cents per acre was so unreasonable as to amount to a donation of the property should only be made after a full evidentiary hearing. Sixteenth section lands were property held in trust for the public schools. A trustee was required to charge a reasonable rental for the leased property of the trust, and a lease of trust property would be set aside where it was for a nominal rental. An annual rental of 40 cents per acre on the leased lands would reflect a value of only $ 8.00 per acre, at a return of five percent. The court took judicial notice that little land in the state could have been purchased on the open market for such a low price. However, in view of the vast disparity in the types, location, topography, demand for rental property, and other facts, the court hesitated to hold as a matter of law that the rental was so grossly unreasonable as to amount to a donation of the leased lands.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment of the circuit court in affirming the Board's order in granting the 25-year lease of 15 acres of sixteenth section lands and in granting the 25-year lease of 96 acres of sixteenth section lands. The court reversed the part of the judgment imposing additional procedures upon the Board to be followed in the granting of future sixteenth section land leases.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Commission filed a petition in a special court of eminent domain to acquire certain land belonging to a landowner. Dissatisfied with the $ 13,000 verdict, the landowner appealed. The court affirmed the special court's judgment without opinion, and assessed the cost of the appeal against the landowner. The Commission sought to correct the judgment to allow it five percent damages on the amount of the judgment. The landowner denied the Commission's right to recover damages and sought to retax the appeal costs. The court sustained the Commission's motion for five percent damages and denied the landowner's motion to retax the appeal costs by holding that the &quot;due compensation&quot; requirement of Miss. Const. art. III, &sect; 17 and the Fifth Amendment did not prohibit taxing the landowner with appeal costs and damages when he unsuccessfully appealed from a judgment of a special court of eminent domain. By holding that Miss.

The testimony offered for the temporary injunction was, by stipulation, also the proof for the permanent injunction. After considering the evidence, a temporary injunction was issued restraining the Sunday sales. Subsequently, a motion to dissolve the injunction was overruled by the trial court and the temporary injunction was made permanent. The court affirmed and held as follows: (1) the Sunday Closing Laws were not found to be unconstitutional under a Fourteenth Amendment analysis because the presumption was that the State legislature intended to and did operate within constitutional confines; (2) it was uncontradicted that the employees of appellants engaged in the Sunday activities of their employers upon a voluntary basis, leaving no leeway for a finding that they were discriminated against by being subjected to Sunday employment for the convenience of others whose businesses or professions were not exempt by statute; and (3) absent any evidence of invidious discrimination in the facts or from a study of the legislation, or in its enforcement, the statutes were constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When appellee presented its petitions to the Board, that body declined to accept jurisdiction, basing its refusal upon the fact that the field where the depleted gas pool was located was partly in one county and partly in another. The trial court reversed the Board, and ordered the cases remanded to the Board.The constitutional challenge in the case was directed at 1971 Miss. Laws ch. 436, &sect; 8, which undertook to exclude one of the counties because it had two judicial districts and was intersected by two highways. The court stated that the exclusion of a county intersected by two highways and having two judicial districts bore no identifiable or rational relationship whatever to the general provisions and purposes of ch. 436 nor did it supply any reasonable basis for the exclusion of such a county. The enactment of a patchwork of local and private &quot;county wide&quot; laws, each applicable to one or more counties only, and exempting the rest, differing from county to county, without regard to any rational or even recognizable classification was prohibited. The court concluded that the trial court correctly declared &sect; 8 unconstitutional and void.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was prosecuted as an accessory under Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 97-1-3 (1972). The court was of the opinion that defendant was an active participant, voluntarily aiding and abetting those involved in the defense of the headquarters and the fatal shooting. Defendant also contended that &sect; 43-21-31 was unconstitutional because it vested power in the prosecutor to determine whether a juvenile defendant would be tried as a juvenile or an adult and deprived him of his presumption of innocence. The court rejected the contention. The district attorney had prosecutorial discretion, and defendant was denied none of his due process rights. Finally, the court found the motion to suppress statements made by defendant was properly denied.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The commission issued an order to condemn a portion of the landowner's property for use as a scale site along a federal highway.

On appeal, the landowner contended that commission did not have the authority to take his land for the described purpose. The court found that Mississippi law contemplated a taking of property alongside a highway for the purpose of constructing a weighing scale to enforce regulations regarding weights of loads and vehicles. In Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 65-1-47 (1972), the commission was given the right of eminent domain for the purpose of securing rights of way for highway purposes. The extent of the authority granted by that section contemplated the acquisition of rights of way to construct and maintain a highway.

The court found that the trial court properly did not allow defendant's attorney to elicit a conclusion from his witness. However, the jury instructions were prejudicial because they incorrectly defined malice aforethought. The court also found that the jury instructions failed to instruct the jury as to the burden of proof in a criminal case. The court held that the current law, Miss.

In addition to the written instructions presented for approval by the attorneys for the litigants, heretofore permitted by Miss.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The billboards in question were erected after the effective date of the Outdoor Advertising Act and were in such proximity to a highway's right-of-way as to violate Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 49-23-5 (1972). The owners refused to remove the billboards. The Commission sought a decree authorizing it to remove the billboards and enjoining appellees from further violations. No compensation was offered for the loss of the signs. The court found that preserving natural beauty was the major factor behind the passage of the Act and supported exercising State police power. The court held that the Act did not violate &sect; 17 of the Mississippi Constitution. Because the State could regulate billboards through its police power, nonconforming signs did not have to be declared a nuisance prior to their removal. The court opined that it was neither unreasonable nor arbitrary for the legislature to distinguish between landowners who lawfully had billboards on their property on the effective date of the Act and landowners who erected signs after the effective date in defiance of the Act. Therefore, Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 49-23-17 (1972) did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company filed a proposed rate increase with the Commission. The company estimated that the proposed rates would generate additional gross annual revenues and would enable the company to realize a return of 9.3 percent on the net average investment in property used in providing intrastate telephone service in Mississippi. After due notice, the protests were filed. The protestants contended that the Commission was unconstitutionally organized. The protestants stated that although rate making was a legislative function, there was no provision for the orders of the Commission to be vetoed or approved by the Governor. The protestants also argued that the Commission as presently organized constituted a fourth branch of government. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly upheld the Commission's order. The court rejected the protestants' contention that the Commission was unconstitutionally organized. The court found that Mississippi Constitution Article 7, &sect; 186 expressly provided for the regulation of telephone rates by commissions.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that the court erroneously applied the &quot;plain view&quot; doctrine by holding that certain police action did not amount to unreasonable search and seizure. The State asserted that the remand for resentencing was erroneous because the State Board of Health had transferred all amphetamines from one schedule to another under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 41-29-111 (1972), thereby allowing a maximum penalty of not more than three years. The court denied the petitions for rehearing and instead, reviewed the constitutionality of &sect; 41-29-111. The court concluded that portions of &sect; 41-29-111 were unconstitutional because the rescheduling of amphetamines increased the punishment of defendant in excess of that fixed by the legislature and thereby infringed upon the separation of powers of the government. Because the statute was separate from the Uniform Controlled Substances Law, it would have no effect for the State Board of Health to revise and republish the schedules, and the maximum amount of time one could be confined for the possession of amphetamines remained one year as prescribed by statute.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Chickasaw County, Mississippi, which convicted him on an indictment charging him with the delivery of amphetamine, a controlled substance. Four indictments had been returned against defendant, to which defendant demurred on the ground that they were unconstitutionally vague, indefinite, and uncertain. The trial court overruled defendant's demurrer.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The four indictments were identical except that two recited that the offenses were committed on a certain day and the other two recited that the offenses were committed 10 days later. Defendant was tried and convicted on one indictment. At issue on appeal was whether the indictment was sufficient to adequately inform him of the nature and cause of the accusation against him as required by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and &sect; 26, Mississippi Constitution (1890). Section 26 secured the accused such a specific description of the nature and cause of that accusation as would enable him to make preparation for his trial and also such identification of the offense that he might be insured against a subsequent prosecution therefor. The court concluded that the indictments at issue could hardly be more indefinite, noting that they did not specify time or place with any particularity, nor did they designate the person to whom delivery was made. The court reasoned that there was no logical way defendant could determine which of the charges arising on a particular day that he was being tried under, and consequently, no way thereafter to plead double jeopardy.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The case involved an alleged concerted attack by defendants upon an officer of the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol that followed upon the arrest of one defendant for driving his automobile 83 miles per hour on a highway where the legal limit was 65. It appeared to be conceded that that defendant was in fact driving his automobile at that speed in violation of the legal limit at the time of his arrest. The evidence for the prosecution and that for defense was in irreconcilable conflict. The law in Mississippi allowed residents to go upon their way after being given traffic law violation tickets or citations, but mandated that nonresidents who were given tickets or citations were to be taken before a magistrate by the arresting officer prior to being released. Defendants contended that that amounted to unconstitutional discrimination against nonresidents. Affirming, the court held in part that the kind of discretion vested in a Mississippi officer as to whether to arrest a traffic violator or to merely issue him a summons was not in and of itself a violation of equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>

The circuit court remanded the action to the files. Thereafter, the property owner filed his replevin action. The court held that the circuit court properly dismissed the property owner's action. The court held that the circuit court erred in dismissing the property owner's replevin action on the three grounds assigned. It was proper for the property owner's attorney to make the affidavit in replevin as long as the affidavit stated the name of the name of the true owner of the property and the owner was entitled to immediate possession. The declaration in replevin was a good declaration. The court held that Mississippi Code Annotated &sect; 49-7-105 (1972) was inapplicable. The court held that the replevin action was prematurely brought. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment dismissing the declaration in replevin for that reason alone.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer operated a cable television business, which served naval base subscribers, who were located in the state. Subscribers received television signals from the state and other states through the cable service. About 20 percent of the signals originated in other states. The commissioner assessed sales tax against the taxpayer. Upon judicial review, the chancery court found that the taxpayer was not liable for the taxes, reasoning that since part of the signals emanated from out-of-state broadcasting stations, the assessment affected interstate commerce and was, therefore, improper and uncollectible. In reversing the judgment on appeal, the court held that the chancery court erred in its reasoning. The court determined that the assessment of sales taxes against the taxpayer under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 27-65-23 was proper because all of the income upon which the taxes could be imposed was derived within the state. Moreover, the vices sought to be eliminated by the Commerce Clause were nonexistent. The nature of the taxpayer's business was such that it was not subject to the danger of burdensome cumulative taxation by other states.</SPAN></P>

The Commission asserted that its finding that public safety required the installation of the gates at the crossing was supported by substantial evidence.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the railroad crossing, the company maintained red flashing warning lights, crossbuck signs, and stop signs. Over 9,000 vehicles traveled over the tracks daily. Trains, both passenger and freight, entered the crossing at speeds in excess of 60 miles per hour. When there was heavy fog, visibility at the crossing was virtually negligible. The circuit court reversed the Commission's order on the grounds that at least one commissioner was heavily biased in favor of the erection of the protective gates. On appeal, the court held that because the Commission's decision that public safety required the gates was supported by substantial evidence, it was not arbitrary or capricious and should not have been reversed on the basis that the case was prejudged. There was no merit to the company's claim that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 77-9-255 (1972), which made it the company's duty to erect protective gates when the Commission declared it required for public safety, resulted in an unconstitutional taking of property by failing to provide for cost allocation between it and the local community. It was within the State's police power to allocate the cost of safety improvements to the company.</SPAN></P>

Appellant was insolvent at the time the suit was brought. However, the claimants had valid claims prior to appellant's insolvency. The lower court found that the Act required the appellant to be obligated to the extent of covered claims existing prior to the determination of insolvency, which included all of the claimants. Appellant challenged this finding. The court was not required to address appellant's contention that the Act was unconstitutional because it did not have standing to raise the constitutionality of the Act. The decisive issue was whether the claims involved were covered claims within the meaning of the Act. The claims were determined to be covered claims within the meaning of the Act. The controlling factor was the appellant's insolvency after the effective date of the Act and not when the claims arose. The court construed the Act in accordance with the legislature's intent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue was whether the act creating the natural gas district was void under Mississippi Constitution Article 4, &sect; 90(r) (1890), which prohibited granting eminent domain by local, private, or special laws; such rights could be granted only by general laws. The act conferred on the district powers authorized by Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 3519-08(e) (1956). Eminent domain was granted by general law to municipalities, companies, public utility districts, or natural gas districts by Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 2780 (1956), codified as &sect; 2749-24 (Supp. 1972). In creating the district, the Legislature included as a class residents within parts of two counties, which was reasonable and constitutional. The district's certificate of public convenience and necessity had no scheduled starting date; therefore, it could not expire. The proposed rate increases were justified by increases in interest cost on debts and increases for maintenance, labor, operations, and materials.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner inmate sought leave to file a petition for a writ of error coram nobis in the Circuit Court of Warren County, Mississippi, as authorized by &sect; 1992.5 Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated (1956).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The inmate contended that &sect; 2223 Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated (Supp. 1972) was declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, or, alternatively, that the Mississippi abortion statute was unconstitutional because of the Roe and Doe decisions. The inmate contended that because the Texas abortion statute was declared unconstitutional as a unit in Roe, the Mississippi statute had to be treated similarly. However, the court held that the Mississippi statute, which proscribed all abortions unless by a licensed, practicing physician for the reasons under subsections (a) and (b), had to be treated like the Georgia abortion statute in Doe. The Mississippi statute did not contain the words of the Georgia statute, &quot;based on his best clinical judgment that an abortion is necessary.&quot; Those words were unnecessary for the statute's validity because the necessity for a particular treatment was a clinical judgment that physicians routinely made in treating a patient. The court held that &sect; 1 of the Mississippi abortion statute was constitutional except for subsections (a) and (b). Because the inmate was not a physician, the abortion she performed violated the Mississippi statute.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pled guilty to two indictments accusing him of forgery and uttering a forgery. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment for each of the crimes, with the sentences to run consecutively. The circuit court simultaneously suspended execution of the sentences and placed defendant on probation. Thereafter, defendant was found guilty of violating his probation. The circuit court revoked the suspension of sentence and probation, and it also sentenced defendant to 10 years imprisonment on each count. Defendant appealed from the greater sentences. In reversing the imposition of the greater sentences, the court held that the circuit court lacked the authority to set aside the sentences previously imposed and impose greater sentences. Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect;&sect; 4004-23 &amp; 400-25 had to be construed together. The circuit court imposed a sentence but suspended the imposition of that sentence, as allowed by Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 4004-23. Thus, under Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 4004-25, when defendant was found to have violated the terms of his probation, the circuit court could only cause the sentence imposed to be executed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the circuit court's action in revoking defendant's suspended sentence and probation. The court reversed the circuit court's action in imposing sentences carrying greater penalties than those originally ordered. The case was remanded for a proper execution of defendant's sentences.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appeal, defendant contended that &sect; 2412.5 Miss. Code 1942 Ann. (Supp. 1958) was unconstitutional because it violated the Equal Protection Clause in that it applied only to male persons. The court rejected the argument and affirmed. The legislature, in adopting &sect; 2412.5, intended to protect persons from being spied upon for lewd, licentious, and indecent purposes. The court reasoned that lewd, licentious, and indecent spying could afford the opportunity to plot the commission of rape or other sex crimes. The court found that only males could commit statutory rape as defined by &sect; 2359 Miss. Code 1942 Ann. (1956) and that there existed rational justification for singling out males for punishment under &sect; 2412.5. The court also rejected defendant's argument that his maximum sentence was cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. A sentence imposed within statutory limitations was neither cruel nor unusual punishment.</SPAN></P>

The decree of the chancery court found that Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 3180 was unconstitutional and then adjudged that Chap. 510, Laws 1971amended &sect;&sect; 3179, 3181 and 3193 and repealed &sect; 3180. On review, the court dismissed the bill. At the time the suit was filed, the candidate had lost the second primary. Thus, he was not in jeopardy of losing any official benefits under the statutes. He did not allege that he was threatened with prosecution or that any other person was threatened with prosecution. There was no actual controversy existing between the candidate and the class and the Secretary and clerk.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought discharge, or that he be resentenced under Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 2562 (1956), or such other relief to which he might be entitled. The main thrust of defendant's motion was that, under a case decided by the United States Supreme Court, the Mississippi statute providing for punishment upon a defendant's conviction of murder, Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 2217 (1956), had been held unconstitutional and that the entire statute had to fall. Defendant argued that, under certain Mississippi judicial opinions, &sect; 2217 was not separable but constituted a single scheme which was unconstitutional in part, and thus the entire statute had to fall. The court found that the Mississippi judicial opinions cited by defendant were not applicable to the present problem. The only infirmity in &sect; 2217 was that the harsher penalty of death might not lawfully be imposed, and the remaining part, which provided for life imprisonment in the penitentiary, did not fall. Thus, the court sustained the motion in part, overruled it in part, and remanded to the trial court for resentencing of defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was a prisoner in the county jail at the time of the crime. When a deputy made his rounds at the jail, defendant removed his wallet, while another prisoner held a knife at the deputy's throat. Defendant argued that because he did not hold the knife, he should not be convicted of armed robbery. On appeal, the court held that because defendant was a principal in the crime of armed robbery, the trial court properly refused his request for a directed verdict. Thus, the trial court properly overruled defendant's motion for a directed verdict. The court rejected defendant's contention that his constitutional right to a jury of his peers was violated by the exclusion of persons convicted of infamous crime and bootleggers as required under &sect; 1762 Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated (1956). The right to a jury of one's peers did not entitle defendant to a jury that included convicted felons or bootleggers. The legislature had a right to impose reasonable qualifications for jurors when such qualifications did not violate the constitutional rights of accused persons to be tried by an impartial jury. The trial court did not err in qualifying the jury as required by &sect; 1762.</SPAN></P>

The prosecuting witness denied that she had consented and testified that her physical injuries had been inflicted by defendant in the course of overcoming her resistance and in forcing her to submit to his will. The court upheld the decision because there was sufficient evidence to support the conviction. Defendant contended that the trial court erred in unduly restricting his examination of a witness touching the victim's general reputation for chastity. Although such evidence was admissible in a rape case, the witness did not understand what was meant by the general reputation for chastity or unchastity of the victim.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder and was sentenced to suffer the death penalty.

In rejecting defendant's argument and affirming the judgment of conviction, the court concluded that the imposition of the death penalty was neither cruel nor unusual. While defendant argued that capital punishment offended contemporary standards of decency common to civilized people and that some states had abolished capital punishment, these changes had been accomplished by the legislatures of those respective states, not by the judiciary, and capital punishment was a form of punishment that had the sanction of history. Further, the fact that capital punishment was carried out infrequently did not render it unusual within the meaning of the state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court stated that similar requirements as to residence had been upheld in various jurisdictions involving residency requirements arising under state statutes, municipal ordinances and civil service commission rules. In addition to having employees ready for emergency the municipality could require residence for the purpose of enhancing performance by way of interest incentive. The court held that there was no constitutional prohibition against a municipality requiring its employees to be residents thereof. Appellants contended that the ordinance placed members of the Fire Department, Police Department and other civil service employees in a different class or category from other city employees.The court found that the ordinance was not an improper classification because the availability of firemen and policemen on short notice directly affected public health and safety in the event of fires, riots, or violations of law involving a large number of people. The ordinance was a valid exercise of the police power of the City in that it related to the public safety, was reasonably related to the attainment of that object and was not oppressive, arbitrary, or discriminatory.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners were developing their property into residential subdivisions. The property had been certified by the Commission to the association for the provision of water and sewage facilities. When the landowners asked the association to provide the facilities, however, the association responded that it was waiting for Commission approval of its extension policy. The landowners construed the response as a rejection of the request, and sought compensation for the cost of the facilities under &sect;&sect; 7716-51 to 7716-59. In affirming the chancery court's judgment affirming the Commission's determination that the landowners were entitled to the relief sought, the court ruled that the applied law did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. It did not unreasonably classify water and sewage providers separately from other providers of utilities. The law was also not an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to the Commission. The legislature could commit to an agency the determination of necessity and convenience. Nor did the Commission's order unconstitutionally deprive the association of its property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

The state officials claimed that Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1273-01, 1273-02 (Supp. 1971) were unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The state officials sought a temporary and permanent injunction against appellees prohibiting them from entering the disputed church property or from preaching for any Church of God church. Appellees prevailed in chancery court and the state officials appealed, claiming that Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1273-01, 1273-02 (Supp. 1971), which provided for the divestment of trust property, were unconstitutional. The court reversed the chancery court. Referring to decisional law, the court noted that, in cases involving a schism within a hierarchical church, the key to determining title to property was whom the church hierarchy deemed the successor to the church.The court stated that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 1273-01 defined a majority of beneficiaries of a religious trust at 66 2/3 percent, while Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 1273-02 allowed that majority to usurp control of the trust in the event of an irreconcilable dispute. Because the majority could divest the mother church of church property without regard to the habendum clause of a deed, the court said, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 1273-01, 1273-02 (Cum. Supp. 1971) violated Miss. Const. art. III, &sect; 18 (1890) and the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Defendant could be prosecuted for murder based on injuries inflicted without the state where the death occurred within the state.Additionally, the court held that defendant's confessions were properly admitted into evidence because they were freely and voluntarily given and defendant was properly warned of his constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The trial court overruled the motion to dismiss and entered judgment in favor of the injured party. The tribe member appealed and the court affirmed. The court found that while there was little proof that he actually was a member of the tribe of Native Americans as he claimed, he also waived any jurisdictional claim and submitted himself to the trial court's jurisdiction by filing his answer and other pleadings. By filing the pleadings the tribe member entered his appearance and the court acquired jurisdiction over his person.

The court affirmed because the ordinance was a valid and constitutional regulation of the management and conduct of fueling stations to safeguard persons and property against known perils of explosions and fires in the use of flammable substances. There was a reasonable relationship between the ordinance and the public good and safety, and the City was authorized to enact it in the exercise of its police power. In addition, the ordinance did not constitute discrimination against self-service auto fueling station operators, but classified them in a constitutional manner so as to afford public security against the perils of explosions and fires in the use of gasoline and other flammable substances covered by the ordinance.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant argued that he was arrested without a warrant for arrest and that the State failed to prove probable cause. On appeal, the court found that under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 2470 (1942, Supp. 1971), the sheriff properly arrested defendant without a warrant in his possession when the sheriff knew that the warrant was outstanding for defendant's arrest. The fact that U.S. Const. amend. XXVI changed the voting age to 18 years did not qualify people under 21 years of age to be jurors under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 1762 (1942, Supp. 1971). A question regarding a witness's knowledge of defendant's reputation did not require reversal when defendant's objection was sustained and the jury was instructed to disregard the question. Defendant's counsel elicited a statement about defendant's prior arrest for reckless driving; thus, defendant could not complain about the statement. However, defendant should have received a misdemeanor sentence when Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 6831-70 (1942, Supp. 1971) provided conflicting penalties. When &sect; 6831-70(a)(2) made possession of LSD a felony and &sect; 6831-70(c) made it a misdemeanor, defendant should have been sentenced under the lesser offense.</SPAN></P>

Code 1942 Ann. &sect;&sect; 1152, 2475, 2646 (1956), appealed a judgment of the Chancery Court of Pontotoc County (Mississippi) which held that defendant was in criminal contempt of court for willfully violating the terms of a prior decree enjoining him from violating the state prohibition laws upon certain described premises.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended on appeal that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court's findings. The State argued that defendant lacked standing to challenge arrest and search warrants underlying its case. The court reversed the judgment. The court concluded that there was not sufficient competent evidence to support the trial court's holding. The court observed that a search of an individual on defendant's premises that produced intoxicating liquor was based upon an arrest warrant on a charge that was unconstitutionally vague, that the State offered no affidavit supporting the indefinite offense, and that no probable cause was shown. The court noted that as to a second individual who was arrested in possession of several bottles of liquor after fleeing the premises, no affidavit supporting the arrest warrant was produced and no probable cause was shown. The court stated that affidavits for two search warrants were fatally defective. The court pointed out that the State sought to impose a severe criminal penalty upon defendant, that he was the owner and operator of the premises, and that he had standing to attack the use against him of the arrest and search warrants.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The State filed a quiet title action to obtain possession of certain swamp land held by the landowners. The State maintained that the original patents issued to the landowners' predecessor in title was void and, thus, title to the land never passed into private ownership. The chancery court disagreed and dismissed the State's quiet title action. On appeal, the court affirmed the chancery court's decree, which confirmed ownership of the swamp land in the landowners. The court held that the original patent was not void but, rather, constituted duly authorized acts of the land commissioner and the governor at the time the transaction occurred and that there was valuable transaction given for the swamp land. The court noted that the State failed to overcome the presumption of validity surrounding the issuance of the patent. The court opined that, given the validity of the patent, it was not necessary to determine the question whether the chancery court was correct in ruling that the doctrine applied against the State as to the original patent.</SPAN></P>

Code 1942 Ann. &sect; 10108 (Supp. 1968). The taxpayer appealed from a decree of the Chancery Court of Jackson County (Mississippi), which denied the taxpayer a refund of those taxes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">All of the sales involved were of petroleum products by the taxpayer to geophysical boats engaged in seismographic exploration in waters of the United States government and other states. A geophysical boat was equipped with seismographic instruments used to take reflections from the bottom of a body of water. All the taxpayer's sales of petroleum to the geophysical boats involved in the suit were made and completed within the boundaries of the State of Mississippi. No exploration was conducted within the territorial waters of Mississippi, and, after the sales, the vessels traveled to and operated outside of the State. The Commission held that the vessels were not engaged in &quot;interstate transportation businesses,&quot; and that the taxpayer's sales to them were subject to the Mississippi sales tax, Miss. Code 1942 Ann. &sect; 10108 (Supp. 1968). The chancery court upheld that finding. On appeal, the court held that because the geophysical boats were not engaged in &quot;interstate transportation businesses,&quot; as their purpose was not commercial transportation, but seismographic exploration; the purchases of petroleum fuels from the taxpayer were not exempt from the Mississippi sales tax.</SPAN></P>

The trial court sustained the board and state's demurrers to the mother's complaint, and the mother sought review. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's decision sustaining the demurrer of the board. The court found that the mother's complaint stated a cause of action because the complaint alleged a denial of rights, which courts of equity could protect. The court also held that the statutes were unconstitutionally void and of no effect because binding decisions of the United States Supreme Court interpreting the First Amendment that absolutely prohibited states from adopting programs or practices in its public schools or colleges which aided or opposed religion.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowner objected to the granting of a full allowable production when the applicants were granted a permit by the state oil and gas board (board) as an exception. The landowner did not contend that the applicants were not entitled to drill the well as an exception. The trial court affirmed the order of the board. On appeal, the court affirmed. It held that there was substantial evidence to support the finding of the board. The exception being reasonably necessary to obtain production, the board had no choice other than to allocate the full allowable because sufficient acreage was underlain by hydrocarbons to permit the full allowable as required by Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 6132-21(c). The court also held that the statute was constitutional, under Miss. Const. art. III, &sect;&sect; 14 and 17 and U.S. Const. amend. XIV, &sect; 1. Because formations of oil and gas were not uniform and there was no way to prove with any degree of certainty the unknown geology beneath the earth, the surface acreage formula adopted by the legislature was as fair and as equitable as any other formula. Thus, the surface acreage formula did not unfairly deprive any landowner of property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

Defendant admitted the murder to the sheriff and showed the sheriff where he left the victim's body. Defendant had a knife and several guns in his possession when he was arrested. Defendant alleged that the circuit court improperly directed the sheriff, who was a State witness, to summon the prospective jurors under Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 1794 (1956). The court held that the jury was legally drawn in accordance with the statutory scheme. The court rejected defendant's allegations that the trial court erred in admitting defendant's weapons and voluntary non-custodial statements into evidence, and that the evidence did not support the jury verdict on insanity.

The chancery court entered a decree that directed the Comptroller to issue a certificate, and appellants prosecuted an appeal. The court concluded that the holding of the chancery court was erroneous. The court found that the written opinion of the Board sufficiently complied with the statutory requirements and that, pursuant to Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 5160 (1956), the burden rested upon the applicants to show a public necessity for the organization and operation of a new bank. The court determined that and a public necessity for a new bank had not been established.

Psychiatric experts testified at a pre-trial hearing and at the trial that defendant showed no evidence of psychos, could understand the nature of the charges against him, and could intelligently participate in his trial. The court found that the trial court was fully justified in concluding that defendant was mentally competent to stand trial. Defendant alleged that the jury was not representative of a true &quot;cross section&quot; of the county, that defendant was denied due process by Mississippi statutes relative to the death penalty, that his sentence constituted cruel and inhuman treatment, and that the trial court erred in refusing to permit the jury to testify at defendant's motion for a new trial.

When he did so, one of the officers ordered him to halt. Defendant whirled and fired two shots in the direction of the officers, who returned the fire. Defendant ran back to the car, jumped in, and drove away. He was later apprehended. An examination of the box disclosed 29 sticks of dynamite, an electric cap, and a home-made timing device. At trial, his principal defense was insanity. On appeal of his conviction, defendant, representing himself, asserted numerous errors. The court sustained defendant's motion to withdraw his motion to dismiss the appeal in part because defendant was not insane and was mentally competent to discharge his lawyers and to represent himself before the court. The court then affirmed the judgment of conviction in part because there was no abuse of discretion in overruling defendant's motion for continuance so that an examination could be made relative to his sanity and the jury was justified in finding that the contents of the box constituted a bomb.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant challenged the judgment of the Circuit Court of Rankin County (Mississippi), which convicted him of the armed robbery of a bank (a violation of Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 2367 (1956)) and sentenced him to serve a term of 45 years in the state penitentiary.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Prior to his state trial, defendant had been convicted in a federal district court of the federal offense of bank robbery. Both the state and federal convictions were based upon the same bank robbery, this robbery having been a crime both against the United States and the State. On appeal, defendant argued that his conviction in federal court barred his subsequent prosecution in the state court for the offense against the State based upon the same unlawful act. He claimed his trial in the state court unconstitutionally exposed him to double jeopardy contrary to Mississippi Constitution, Article 3, &sect; 22 (1890) and the Fifth Amendment. The court affirmed. Based upon past precedent, the court ruled that where the same transaction constituted a crime under federal and state law, an accused party may be punished for both crimes; an acquittal or a conviction in the court of either was no bar to an indictment in the other, in the absence of statutory provisions to the contrary. Thus, the court found no merit in defendant's double jeopardy argument. The court also found that the evidence of defendant's guilt was overwhelming and that there was no error in the given jury instructions.</SPAN></P>

Appellants' claims were cancelled and they were permanently enjoined from trespassing on the same. Five bills of complaint were consolidated and tried as one.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellees, in their complaints, sought the cancellation of claims of appellants. The man and his wife purchased the land in 1937 and had made their home there. Their dwelling was situated only 90 feet from the south bank of the creek. The uncontradicted evidence showed that they had kept the land closed to the public. Appellants contended that they had a right to enter upon the land because the creek was a navigable stream. Upon review, the court found that Mississippi Code 1942 &sect; 8414 defined navigable waters. The creek was a small stream that followed a tortuous course over appellees' land. There was relatively little water in it. No commercial or other traffic had ever used the creek as a &quot;water highway,&quot; and no boats other than canoes had been floated down it. The evidence supported the chancery court's findings, and it was impossible to say that he was manifestly wrong that the creek was not a navigable stream. The deraignment of appellees' record title was not challenged by special demurrer in the chancery court and could not be raised on appeal, nor could appellants complain that appellees' claim of adverse possession was insufficient.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant entered a plea of guilty to a charge of false pretenses. He was placed on probation. Subsequently, his probation was revoked. Appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging the statute under which he was convicted was unconstitutional, that certain evidence should not have been admitted, and that the court abused its discretion in revoking his probation. The lower court dismissed his petition. On appeal, the court affirmed. A habeas corpus proceeding was not a correct method to challenge the admission of evidence, and an order revoking suspension was not appealable. Therefore, the court could only address the constitutionality of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 2153 (1958). The statute was constitutional because it did not compel a defendant to testify against himself, and there was a rational connection between the crime charged and the facts proven.</SPAN></P>

The court ruled that the law under which the leases were awarded, &sect; 6597-12, Mississippi Code of 1942 Annotated (Supp. 1968), was constitutional. The law dealt with the land itself, and the classification of levee lands was germane to its subject matter. The board had jurisdiction to award the leases. The court held the notice of the bidding was properly published in one of the county's newspapers as required by &sect; 6597-12. Since the leases to be let had to be approved by the board, the only practical way was to ask for sealed, written bids in order that the same might be submitted to the board.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the sentence entered in the Circuit Court of Harrison County (Mississippi). Defendant had previously been convicted of murder and sentenced to death.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After the first trial, conviction, and review by writ of error coram nobis, defendant was given a second trial, this one solely on the issue of punishment. Defendant was again sentenced to death. The court affirmed. The court held that the death penalty imposition did not conflict with the United States Supreme Court case of United States v. Jackson, as the Jackson case involved the federal kidnapping act. Under Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 2217 (1956), the question of life or death in a capital case belonged exclusively to the jury. The court found no merit in defendant's claim that allowing two nude torso photographs of the victim into evidence was reversible error. The fact that the photos might arouse jurors' emotion did not render them inadmissible. There was no error in the State excluding all blacks from the jury through peremptory strikes, as the State did not have to accept jurors because they were of the same race as defendant. Defendant was not entitled to a full trial on remand from the Fifth Circuit. There was no ban on severing the issues of guilt and punishment.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of murder under &sect; 2223, which purported to make the death of the mother resulting from an illegal abortion the crime of murder. The court reversed the conviction and remanded for a new trial. The court determined that &sect; 2223, enacted by Chapter 260, Laws 1952, was not in contravention of &sect; 61 of the Constitution of 1890 (Mississippi), and it was a valid statute in its entirety. However, the only instruction given for the state was erroneous because it failed to require the state to meet its full burden of proof. Although the trial judge did not err in holding that testimony of the deceased's mother as to a phone conversation with the deceased before her death was admissible as res gestae, even such evidence was circumstantial, as opposed to direct evidence that defendant, a physician, performed the abortion. The evidence was admissible as a verbal act showing an intention on the part of the decedent to have something done about her pregnancy. Since all the evidence that tended to show that defendant performed the abortion was circumstantial, it was reversible error not to require the state to meet its full burden of proof.</SPAN></P>

Appellant vendor refused to comply and the Commission suspended the vendor's license to sell milk for 120 days, or in lieu thereof, ordered the vendor to pay a $ 5,000 penalty.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The vendor claimed that the Commission's fixing of milk prices was unconstitutional and that its license suspension was void because it was based upon an order changing the butterfat content in milk that was enacted without providing the vendor the requisite statutory notice. The court rejected these claims and affirmed the lower court's judgment. The court summarily rejected the claim that the Commission's actions were unconstitutional because this matter had been resolved in prior litigation and the statutes with reference to the Commission did not violate either the state or the federal constitutions. The court also held that, when construed together, the various provisions of the laws enabling the Commission did not require that affected persons receive mail notice containing a proposed order 15 days before a hearing at which a rule was proposed to be changed. The court found that such notice would be destructive of the overall purpose of this statutory scheme and that affected vendors were only entitled to notice of the changed order prior to its effective date.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were indicted for the theft of a cow under Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 2240 (1956). They entered pleas of not guilty, one defendant obtained a severance, and both defendants purported to withdraw their not guilty pleas and enter pleas of guilty. They were then sentenced. The Circuit Court of Amite County (Mississippi) later overruled defendants' motions to vacate their convictions and sentences, and defendants appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants' motions to vacate were brought on the grounds that (1) they did not voluntarily and understandingly enter guilty pleas, and (2) Negroes were systematically excluded from the grand jury and from the petit jury which would have decided their cases if they had been tried on pleas of not guilty. On the instant appeal, as to the first ground of the motions to vacate, the court stated that, beginning in 1966, the method of jury selection in Amite County was entirely changed from the prior system and a new method of nondiscriminatory selection was adopted. It found no constitutional infirmity in it. As to the second ground, the court stated that since the first defendant did not plead to the felony indictment personally, his plea of guilty by his attorney was invalid. Furthermore, it stated, the evidence reflected that even if the plea by attorney were valid, it was not made intelligently and understandingly. As to the second defendant, the court stated that since the State made no affirmative showing, spread on the record, of the prerequisites of a valid waiver, it would reverse the judgment overruling his motion to vacate his conviction.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court overruling the motions to vacate defendants' convictions and rendered judgment vacating defendants' pleas of guilty and sentences. The cause was remanded for further proceedings under the indictment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer obtained an injunction restraining the Board president and his successors from using equipment, machinery, and materials to construct, maintain, or improve private property. A year later the taxpayer filed a new complaint based upon separate and different violations of the use of county machinery, materials, and labor for the benefit of private citizens on unauthorized projects. The trial court granted the Board president's motion to strike the complaint because the complaint was neither prepared nor filed by an attorney. On appeal, the court held that the taxpayer could write and file his own complaint. The taxpayer was not engaging in the unauthorized practice of law if he represented himself. The court sympathized with the taxpayer's complaint that he could not afford to retain counsel and that he was unable to persuade members of the local bar to participate in the suit against local office holders. The court determined that Miss. Const. art. III, &sect; 24 and Miss. Const. art. III, &sect; 25, together with Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 2944 authorized citizens and taxpayers of Mississippi to prevent and correct abuses in office by duly elected public officials.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decree that dismissed the taxpayer's action against the Board president and remanded the case for trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city passed Gulfport, Miss., Ordinance No. 1121, creating a classification for hotels, motels, and apartments, and a two block area along a major highway was rezoned. The property owners wanted the area to be zoned for all commercial purposes and asserted that Ordinance No. 611 was arbitrary and capricious, constituted spot zoning, and was void because it contained two subject matters in violation of Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 3374-74 (1956). Testimony was presented as to the changes in the city since the last zoning ordinance was enacted and the need for the new classification, and the circuit court upheld the classification and the rezoning. The court affirmed, ruling that the creation of the new classification and the rezoning of the one area did not constitute two different subjects in violation of &sect; 3374-74. In addition, Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 3590 (1956) delegated zoning power to cities, and a rezoning of an area was to be determined based upon what was in the best interest and general welfare of the entire city. The decision was within the discretion of the city and the court would not substitute its judgment for that of the city's legislative body.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant contended that he should either be given a life sentence or a new trial on the issue of guilt as well as that of penalty. In denying the petition for rehearing, the court found that there was no constitutional inhibition against severing the issues of guilt and punishment. The applicable statutes were Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect;&sect; 2217 and 2536 (1956). No provision was made for the determination of the penalty when an accused entered a plea of guilty. There was also no provision made for determination of the penalty in a situation arising under Witherspoon where there was no other error requiring reversal as to the issue of guilt. Guilt and punishment were severable even though the statutes provided for the jury rendering the verdict to fix the punishment. Since defendant's guilt had been lawfully determined and only the question of punishment remained, it was unnecessary to relitigate the question of guilt. Defendant was not entitled to another trial on the issue of guilt, and it would serve no purpose.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The market owners had been purchasing ice cream and ice milk, storing it at one of their stores, and then distributing it to other outlets that they owned. The Commissioner began an investigation and discovered that the market owners had a general cost of doing business of approximately 18 percent, above the 15 percent markup presumed under &sect; 4560-106(a). The Commissioner gave the market owners an opportunity to sign a cease and desist agreement pursuant to Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 4560-118(b) (Supp. 1966), which they refused. The Commissioner then began his enforcement action. The market owners attempted to prove their cost of doing business peculiar to their owning and servicing their refrigeration units, which evidence the chancellor refused to accept. Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 4560-106(a) (Supp. 1966), spelled out the methods of proving costs in order to rebut the presumption of 15 percent costs. Because there was actual proof of the market owners' costs, the presumptions of the statute that their costs were 15 percent did not apply. Additionally, as applied to the market owners, the fee and cost recovery provisions were not unconstitutional.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. The court held that the very fact that the supervisors could not identify the number of people shown in certain tabulations as &quot;unknown,&quot; was convincing proof that there was no effort on their part to purposely or wilfully exclude or discriminate against blacks; thus, the trial court was correct in overruling defendant's motion to quash the grand jury and the trial venire. The court held, however, that the trial court erred in admitting certain admission by defendant claimed by the sheriff to have been made to him. It was not clearly shown that Miranda warnings were given, and the sheriff's evidence, if sufficient to comply with Miranda, made only a prima facie case.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company alleged that the Commission wrongfully required it to pay chain store privilege taxes, plus penalties, under Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect;&sect; 9300 through 9311 (1952), and sought recovery of the sum paid. The lower court dismissed the suit. The court affirmed. The company alleged that it was not a retailer as defined in Mississippi Code 1942 Annotated &sect; 9301(c) (1952). The statute did not intend to exempt those who engaged in a retail business because such retailer also operated another business or other businesses from which he derived a greater proportion of income. It was further not error to consider leased shoe departments as being stores within the meaning of the chain store taxing statutes. It was the legislative intent that the tax apply whether the &quot;business of a retailer&quot; was conducted in a multistory building entirely devoted to that purpose, in an apartment, a single room, or in a &quot;shoe department&quot; in a leased portion of a larger area. Finally, there was no merit to the company's contention that the chain store taxing statutes unconstitutionally delegated uncontrolled discretion to the Commission with respect to the imposition of penalties.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 5866. The total fine amounted to $ 2,650. On appeal, the court affirmed as to the conviction but reversed and remanded for imposition of a proper sentence. Although a jury instruction was improper, it did not prejudice defendant because the proof of defendant's guilt was uncontested. Section 5866 provided that, upon conviction, the trial court could impose an additional penalty upon defendant of $ 10 for each fish taken in violation of the law. Defendant, however, had been charged only with illegal possession of fish, not with having illegally taken the fish.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While they were lawfully in session, the city's officials adopted a resolution directing the sale of the bonds for a general street improvement program. The record did not show what percentage of the city's streets would be improved by the bond issue but it did show there were a number of streets that were not included. Before the officials adopted the resolution, various property owners filed protests against certain streets. When the officials adopted the resolution, they adjudicated the results of the protests, eliminating the streets that were protested by a majority of owners and including other streets on which there was not a majority protesting. On appeal, the court held that the city need not have adjudicated the special benefits to the abutting property owners in order for it to issue the bonds for the improvements under the statutes. The record showed that the city's officials adjudicated the necessary, statutory jurisdictional facts. They need not have adjudicated evidentiary facts which had been considered prior to making their determinations on the ultimate facts. The statutes did not limit the number of streets or percentage of streets that the city might improve.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">This was an appeal from a final decree of the Chancery Court of Warren County, Mississippi, affirming an order of appellee State Tax Commission in which the Commission designated a certain area as a resort area after the Commission initially rejected the designation. Appellant representatives of a voluntary association filed objections with the Commission relative to the allowance of a rehearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue on appeal was whether the Commission had the power and authority to hear evidence and determine that the area brought to the attention of the Commission by the letters from the attorneys representing private parties operating businesses within a certain area was a &quot;resort area&quot; within the meaning of the Local Option Alcoholic Beverage Control Law of Mississippi. The record clearly showed that there was only one hearing as contemplated by the statute, and for that reason the issue of &quot;res judicata&quot; and the question of &quot;changed circumstances&quot; were not relevant nor applicable to the facts now before the court on appeal. The preliminary objection of labeling the area a resort area was done without a public hearing. The State Commission not only had the authority as a legislative administrative agency to hold the hearing upon the application of the board to determine &quot;resort areas&quot; but it was the Commission's duty under Miss. Code 1942 Ann. &sect; 10265-17(a)(12)(16) (Supp. 1966) to hold a public hearing upon the application. Moreover, a failure on the part of the Commission to conduct the hearing required by statutory law would have been unlawful, arbitrary, and capricious.</SPAN></P>

Code Ann. &sect; 2249 (1956). The State sought a review of the suspension of the attorney's disbarment.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant claimed that the indictment against him should have been quashed and that the property, which he was alleged to have received, should have been suppressed, because it was obtained illegally. The court determined that defendant's demurrer to the indictment was properly overruled, because the indictment was properly drawn under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 2249 (1956) and stated a violation of &sect; 2249 for receiving stolen goods. The court further determined that defendant's arrest was lawful, when he was paid money in exchange for the stolen property from the owner, while the police officers were watching. The court held that, because the arrest was lawful, the search and seizure of the goods was also lawful, as incident to the arrest. The court concluded that the proof was sufficient to show that defendant knowingly received stolen goods, when defendant acknowledged that they were taken from the owner before exchanging money for the items. The court finally concluded that the circuit court was without authority to suspend the disbarment of defendant, because it was mandatory pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 8667 (1956).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court ordered that the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed as to the conviction of defendant and that the judgment was reversed and rendered on the State's appeal on the suspending the order of disbarment.

Defendant was convicted for a felonious trespass as a &quot;peeping Tom, in violation of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 2412.5 (Supp. 1966). Defendant appealed and contended that the indictment should have been dismissed because he had no preliminary hearing. The court held that the record showed that defendant waived the hearing.

The court reversed and remanded and held that blacks had been improperly excluded from the jury. The trial court admitted that in past years the jury lists were unfair.

In reversing the conviction, the court ruled that the evidence did not sustain the conviction. The State relied wholly on circumstantial evidence that was not so completely conclusive as to have excluded every other reasonable hypothesis. The evidence did not show that defendant knew of the existence of the drugs in his truck. Furthermore, because the search warrant upon defendant had not been served, the search of his truck was ruled illegal. As such, there was no evidence upon which a judgment of guilt could be sustained. The court did find that blacks had not been systematically excluded from defendant's jury, even though only one black juror was selected.

Code 1942 Ann. &sect; 2079 (1956). Defendant had been originally convicted in a mayor's court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the issues pertained to jury selection and the arrest and search of defendant's person. Defendant had filed a motion to quash the jury venire on the ground of systematic exclusion of African Americans from the jury lists prepared by the county supervisors and from the venire of the September 1966 term. The court held that the circuit court correctly overruled the motion upon its finding that the supervisors had made an honest effort to comply with the law in selecting juries without discrimination as to race, as the record affirmatively reflected that the supervisors were not guilty of any invidious discrimination as to race in their selection of the jury venire, and the undisputed facts as to the racial constitution of the juries for the September term rebutted any charge of systematic exclusion of African Americans. Affirming, the court also held that defendant's contention that his arrest and the search of his person were illegal was without merit, as the offense of carrying a concealed weapon was committed in the presence of an officer, who was therefore authorized under Miss. Code 1942 Ann. &sect; 2470 (1956) to arrest defendant.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

The court agreed with the lower court's conclusion that the language of &sect; 9344 plainly authorized a credit upon all income taxes due by the taxpayer. The legislature supplied no formula and made no provision in the statute for prorating the credit upon a percentage or upon any other basis, and there was nothing in the statute to indicate an intention on the part of the legislature to limit application of the credit to income tax due on that portion of the taxpayer's income derived exclusively from its business of financing loans secured by tangible personal property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff was electrocuted while working on a road near both the railway's tracks and some high voltage electric wires owned the electric company. Defendants contended that they were not liable because 1) plaintiff was a trespasser upon the railway's land; 2) electric company had a right to have its wires upon the railway's land; and 3) plaintiff assumed the risk of danger of the power lines. On appeal, the court affirmed in part, holding that plaintiff was a &quot;licensee&quot; upon the railway's land; thus, it owed no duty except to refrain from willfully or wantonly injuring him. The court reversed in part as to the judgment in favor of the electric company. The court ruled that the issue of its liability was a question for the jury. The court noted that plaintiff was not a trespasser because he was not willfully in violation of the statute. Moreover, the company had no legal &quot;interest&quot; in the railway's land, which made the relationship that of a continuous revocable licensee. Finally, any defense under the &quot;assumption of risk&quot; doctrine did not barred the suit altogether, but went to the amount of damages.</SPAN></P>

That decree upheld an order of the State Tax Commission that required the company to pay additional tax based on the determination of the Commission regarding its formula, at Article 247 of Regulation No. 12, for tax apportionment of income for pipeline companies with in-state and out-of-state income.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was an out-of-state one, but it had a large amount of pipeline in Mississippi and none in the state of its headquarters. Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 9220-12(1)(c), (2) (Supp. 1964) stated in part that the portion of the company's income attributable to sources in Mississippi could be determined by a formula or formulas of general apportionment set by the Commissioner with the governor's approval. The company challenged the Commissioner's determination that under Article 247 of Regulation No. 12 administrative and general salary expenses were excluded from the fraction for apportionment. The court ruled that the regulation clearly excluded wages and other compensation paid in connection with administrative functions and property used in connection with those functions. The court held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 9220-12(2) (Supp. 1964) was not an unconstitutional delegation of authority to the Commission. Per the court, having provided a standard, the Legislature could give to the Commissioner the power to determine what part of the company's income was attributable to its business within the state. Section &sect; 9220-12(1)(c), (2) did not specifically exclude any items from apportionment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sold the shotgun in question under a conditional sales contract. The owner retained title to the gun until the full purchase price was paid. A balance was still due on the gun when it was seized and declared contraband by a game warden. The owner became aware of the gun's impending sale only after a notice was posted at the courthouse. The owner argued that Chapter 149 of the Laws of 1956, which provided for the seizure of the gun, violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and &sect; 14 of the Constitution of the State of Mississippi. The circuit court affirmed a judgment awarding possession of the gun to the county sheriff, but the court reversed and entered judgment for the owner. The court found that due process required essential fairness and justice in judicial proceedings. The guarantee of due process assured every person his day in court. There had to be notice of some kind, either actual or constructive, and an opportunity afforded to be heard before the property of an innocent owner out of possession could be forfeited; otherwise, the true owner was deprived of his property without due process of law.</SPAN></P>

Under the U.S. Const. amend VI, an accused enjoyed the right to assistance of counsel. The court held that this right extended to every stage of the prosecution. There was no justification for imposing a restriction of silence between defendant and her counsel during the trial recess. Further, the court held that, on remand, a judicial determination should be made as to whether probable cause existed for defendant's arrest at the time that the search was made of defendant's residence.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The landowners' property was within an instrument approach zone and a transition surface zone near the airport, as defined by a zoning ordinance adopted by a joint airport zoning board, and thus was subject to the zoning ordinance, which imposed graduated height restrictions for structures and trees on the landowners' property, the highest limit being 50 feet. The complainants alleged in their bill that the landowners permitted certain trees on their property to continue to grow above such height limits and thus into the restricted area. The landowners filed a general demurrer to the complainants' bill, which demurrer the lower court sustained, and the complainants appealed. The court affirmed, holding that under the guise of a perhaps otherwise valid zoning ordinance, the complainants interfered with and restricted the use and enjoyment of the landowners' property, which thereby constituted a taking or damaging thereof for public use without due compensation being first made, as was required in Miss. Const. &sect; 17. The court concluded that as the continuous invasion of the landowners' super-adjacent airspace affected the use of their surface lands, such invasion was a taking.</SPAN></P>

A prior quo warranto proceeding was filed by the incumbents on the relation of the district attorney against the elected candidates, which challenged their right to take office. The circuit court declared that the election was void because of the pending petition. After the petition was passed, the incumbents were re-elected to their former offices. In affirming the sustaining of the demurrer, and the entry of judgment for the incumbents, the court held that (1) the order of the circuit court in the quo warranto proceeding against the elected candidates was not void, and that the acts of the incumbents as de facto officers until they were elected and took office under the new form of government were valid. Consequently, the incumbents were the duly elected and qualified officers of the city, and the elected candidates were not entitled to the relief prayed for.</SPAN></P>

Defendant appealed to the county court, where he was tried de novo before a jury. That trial resulted in a conviction, and defendant was sentenced to pay a fine and serve a term of 90 days in the city jail. Defendant subsequently appealed to the circuit court, wherein the conviction was affirmed. The court affirmed, holding that there was ample evidence from which the jury could find that defendant was guilty of the offense charged.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The trial court quashed an indictment for murder returned by the grand jury against appellee. The sole ground of the motion was that under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 1762 (1956) women were excluded from jury service and such denied to appellee the equal protection of the law as guaranteed by U.S. Const. amend. XIV. On appeal by the State, the court stated that the right to vote was not a right and privilege protected by the Constitution. Further, the court stated that it was a reasonable classification to exclude all women from juries except those who desired to serve. Jury service was not a right or privilege guaranteed to anyone. It was an obligation imposed by law upon those who came within a designating class possessing the prescribed qualifications. The court held that the state could, without violation of the equal protection guaranty, deny to women the right to serve as jurors. Such denial did not deprive either a male or female defendant of equal protection of the laws. The court held that the fixing of qualification for juries was a legislative matter and that, if it was necessary to resort to classification, such as by sex was reasonable.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee contracted with appellant, a commodities broker, to buy and sell commodity futures contracts but suffered a loss when the market fell and appellant could not sell his futures contracts because of limits imposed by the exchange rules.

Appellee counterclaimed for loss profits. The trial court held neither party was entitled to recovery and held that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 26 (1956) violated the state's public policy and was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the commodities exchange. On appeal, the court found that the legislature had the right to determine public policy and that the enforcement of contracts made under exchange rules was not delegation of legislative powers.

The court reversed finding that the proof showed no disorderly conduct nor any distracting activity.

Regulating the use of the streets, for parades and processions was a traditional exercise of control by local government. The question case was whether that control was exerted so as not to deny or unwarrantedly abridge the right of assembly and the opportunities for the communication of thought and the discussion of public questions immemorially associated with resort to public places. The ordinance conferred upon the chief of police of the city unrestricted discretion as to who shall or shall not parade or march on the sidewalks or streets of the city, with no standards as to time, place of marching or any other feature.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The owner sought to enjoin the foreclosure of a deed of trust on his real property after alleging that appellees had charged usurious interest and included illegal charges. Furthermore, the owner alleged that the Small Loan Regulatory Act of 1958, Miss. Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 5591-01 to 5591-54 (Supp. 1964), regulating the activities of appellees, who were licensed brokers and lenders, was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly dissolved the temporary injunction and dismissed the owner's bill. Specifically, the court first rejected the owner's argument that the Act was unconstitutional because it violated Miss. Const. art. 4, &sect; 90(d), which prevented the legislature from passing private or special laws regulating the rate of interest on money. Instead, the court held that the Act was not unconstitutional as written or as applied in the case because it was a general act that attempted no special classifications. Regardless of the Act's constitutionality, however, the court noted that the deed of trust involved in the case would have been valid under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 5590, due to the right of brokers to collect a fee.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">When the appeal came on for hearing in circuit court, appellants demanded a trial de novo before a jury, which was denied. The court held that the circuit court did not err in denying appellants a jury trial or a trial de novo. The court found that the order of the board was legislative in nature. If the circuit court had granted appellants a trial de novo, the review would have resulted in the circuit court exercising original authority to perform a legislative function. The court held that the provisions of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 6334-05 (Supp. 1964) providing for a trial de novo before a jury were unconstitutional and invalid. That part of &sect; 6334-05 providing for appeals from the board to the circuit court was sufficiently broad to allow making a stenographic record of the testimony and the certification of a transcript, or to authorize a bill of exceptions. It was the duty of the person appealing from an order of the board to take the necessary steps to preserve the record. Appellants contended that there should have been an election to determine whether the high schools should have been closed. However, there was no provision for an election under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 6328-05.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The election and acts of appellees in establishing the separate judicial district were pursuant to the provisions of Miss.

On appeal, the court held that the Act did not violate Miss. Const. &sect; 14 (1890) or the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The Act was not an unlawful delegation of legislative power, nor were the various sections of the Act so vague and uncertain as to render it incomplete and unworkable. 1962 Miss. Laws ch. 257 was a general law and was not a local and private, or special law, as contended by the complainants. The court was of the opinion that the minutes of the Board of Supervisors of the county were in accord with the statutory requirements of Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 2886 (1964), and that the election called and held, under the facts shown, was a valid election.

In affirming, the court held that complainants failed to meet the burden of proving an avulsion. The stream was, and had always been, the boundary between the parties' property. Complainants failed to prove title by adverse possession. While the lower court erred in making certain evidentiary decisions, those decisions were not reviewable on appeal because complainants failed to preserve the errors for appellate review.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While in her home, the victim saw defendant, who was looking at her through a window. When the victim went to answer the doorbell, she discovered that defendant was already in the house. When she asked him what he wanted, he asked her if she knew him. Subsequently, he attacked her. Defendant eventually ran away when the victim fought him. The victim described defendant to the police and stated that she was sure she had seen him before. Thereafter, the police asked defendant, who worked at a restaurant, to put on certain clothing which the victim had described. While wearing such clothing and repeating the words that the victim claimed he said while in her house, defendant was identified by the victim. The court held that the evidence was sufficient under &sect; 2036 to show that defendant broke and entered the building for some unlawful purpose and to show that he had a specific intent to ravish. The court further held that defendant's right against self-incrimination was not violated when the victim identified defendant while he was wearing the clothes the officers asked him to wear and after he repeated the words the officers asked him to say.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed the conviction after determining that the trial court had committed reversible errors and that defendant did not have a fair and impartial trial. The trial court erred in refusing to sustain in denying defendant's motion to quash the indictment. Under the indictment, the trial court could not have determined whether or not the language used by defendant in telephone call to the prosecuting witness, was obscene, vulgar, indecent, or insulting because it did not have the words before it to pass upon the question. The trial court erred in refusing to sustain the defendant's objections where in the prosecuting witness was permitted to write the words allegedly spoken to her over the telephone instead of testifying orally what they were. Defendant was entitled to a free, full, and complete cross-examination of any witness who testified him.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff manufacturer appealed a judgment from the Chancery Court of Warren County (Mississippi) that dissolved a previously-issued temporary injunction and dismissed the manufacturer's petition that sought to enjoin defendant retailer from advertising and selling the manufacturer's trade-marked goods, under the Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 1108 (1956) of the Fair Trade Act (FTA). By cross-appeal, the constitutionality of the FTA was challenged.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The manufacturer alleged that the retailer was advertising and selling the manufacturer's goods in the pharmaceutical field at prices below the minimum resale prices established by the manufacturer under the FTA. The trial court refused to enforce the FTA as unconstitutional. On appeal, the court ruled that: (1) under the court's prior precedent, the constitutionality of the FTA was settled and there was no reason to hold otherwise; (2) the trial court properly ruled that the non-signer provision of the FTA was invalid when it was enacted because it conflicted with the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 1; (3) the trial court erred in holding that notwithstanding passage of the McGuire Act, 15 U.S.C.S. &sect; 45, which redefined the distribution of power over interstate commerce, the FTA remained void; (4) the trial court's holding, that the non-signer provision remained invalid after enactment of the McGuire Act because it was never re-enacted, was not supported by reason or authority; and (5) the evidence supported the trial court's finding that the manufacturer's commodities were in fair and open competition with commodities of the same general class produced by others.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed that part of the trial court's judgment that denied the manufacturer an injunction and remanded the cause for issuance of an injunction.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff arrestee appealed from a judgment of the Circuit Court of Hinds County (Mississippi) by which the trial court dismissed his action for malicious prosecution against defendants, justice of the peace, retailer, insurer, sheriff, and others. Prosecution had been mistakenly commenced against the arrestee under the Bad Check Law, Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 2135 (Recomp. 1942).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An individual with a name similar to the arrestee's tendered a check drawn on insufficient funds to the retailer. In an effort to obtain payment of the check, the retailer's agent then executed an affidavit pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 2154, which reflected that the arrestee had tendered the check. Based on the affidavit, the justice of the peace issued a warrant for the arrestee's arrest pursuant to Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 1832. The arrestee was arrested at work and held until his coworker paid the amount of the unpaid check plus costs and expenses. The trial court dismissed the arrestee's suit, finding that he had failed to state a cause of action. On appeal, the court held that the trial court properly dismissed the arrestee's claim against the justice of the peace because there was no allegation that he had acted with malice in issuing the arrest warrant, knew that the prosecution was being instituted to collect a civil debt, or that he lacked jurisdiction to issue the warrant. However, the court held that because the retailer's agent had instituted the criminal prosecution to collect a civil debt, the arrestee had stated a cause of action against the retailer and its agent.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment to the extent by which it dismissed the arrestee's malicious prosecution action against the justice of the peace that issued the warrant for his arrest.

On review, the court reversed the decree because of the overwhelming and undisputed evidence that appellant had mailed the notice of cancellation and, pursuant to the standard cancellation provision in the policy, cancellation was effective upon mailing and not upon receipt of the notice or return of premium.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The district determined the necessity for the condemnation of the owners' property and authorized the filing of eminent domain proceedings.

It further stated that the only interchange connecting a highway to the reservoir was immediately adjacent to the land, and that part of it was necessary for the relocation of the highway. The court held: (1) most of the assignments of error filed had been previously decided against the owners in another case; (2) the trial court erred in enjoining the construction of restaurants, hotels, motels, or like facilities on the land; and (3) the district was authorized to acquire lands and fees within a quarter mile limit for transfer to the federal government for relocation of the highway under Subsection 5956-61(f), (g) of Mississippi Code 1942, Rec., and subsection 6001(c) of Mississippi Code 1942, Rec., part of Laws of 1936, chapter 201.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The interstate pipeline operator sought a refund for payment of a use tax on gas used to operate its compressor stations located within the state. The trial court determined that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 10146-12 (1942) exempted this particular use of the interstate pipeline operator's gas and ordered the tax refunded. The state tax commission argued on appeal that the interstate pipeline operator did not own the gas that it used to operate its compressor stations located within the state. The court rejected this argument. The court noted that the interstate pipeline operator paid for the amount it used to operate its compressor stations at the time the gas was delivered to the interstate pipeline operator in Louisiana. The court pointed out that the statutory exemption manifested an intent to grant an exemption for the gas used to operate its compressor facilities, which were necessary to operate its interstate pipeline. The court found that the purchase and payment of the gas in Louisiana to operate the compressor stations in Mississippi resulted in ownership of the gas at that point, which meant it was exempt from the state use tax.</SPAN></P>

After he entered a whites-only waiting room in a bus station and refused to obey a police officer's order to leave, he was arrested for disorderly conduct. When his conviction was affirmed, defendant appealed. Affirming, the court said that the facts in the case amply sustained his conviction under &sect; 2087.5. Defendant's acts, under the circumstances involved, were sufficient to sustain his conviction. The police officer arrested defendant in good faith under a reasonable apprehension of an imminent breach of the peace. Defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by his conviction. The State's interest in preventing violence and disorder, which were imminent under the undisputed facts, was the vital and controlling fact in the case. After careful analysis of &sect; 2087.5, the court concluded that it was not vague and indefinite. The act did not deny defendant due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

The court affirmed and found that the Commission had exclusive jurisdiction of the income tax assessment, and that, before they could pursue a remedy in the chancery court, they were required to have proceeded before the Commission by the method provided in Mississippi Code Ann. &sect; 9220-31 (1942). Under Mississippi Code Ann. &sect;&sect; 9220-25(7) (1942), they should have presented their defenses to the assessment, including their statute of limitation defense, to the Commission when they received notice of their right to file an appeal and to show cause why the tax or deficiency was not payable. The court also found that &sect; 9220-27(9) prohibited the chancery court from enjoining collection of the taxes. Moreover, the taxpayers had not complained in the chancery court that they were deprived of the statute of limitation defense or that the assessment was erroneous, but instead merely challenged the Commission's authority to impose the tax.</SPAN></P>

The habeas corpus proceeding was brought against the State by the accused's attorneys.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The accused's attorneys argued that the committing order was invalid and, as such, denied the accused due process of law. The court agreed and, after amending the order, affirmed it. The court explained that Miss. Code &sect; 2575.5 (1942) required that the court find that there was a reasonable probability that the accused was incapable of making a rational defense prior to issuing a committing order. The court opined that there was no evidence that the accused was incapable of conducting a rational defense in the trial on the indictment against him and, in fact, that all three of the accused's able and experienced attorneys agreed that he had the present capacity to stand trial. The court noted that an order made on an application to submit a defendant to a mental hospital for a psychiatric examination was not a final order and, therefore, no appeal was permitted from such an order. The court explained that such an order was merely a temporary or interlocutory order of commitment pending the trial of the accused and, that the remedy of an accused that believed that the restraint was not in conformity with the law was by habeas corpus.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill alleged that the existing County districts were established more than 100 years ago and had not changed with population changes as reflected by the census; that the Board's failure to redistrict the County as Miss. Const. &sect; 170 and Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 2870 (Recomp. 1942) required caused the residents to suffer irreparable damage by denying equal rights and equal protection under U.S. Const. amend.

The court opined that the residents claimed that they did not have an adequate remedy at law, yet they recognized &sect; 2870, which stated the remedy to which they were entitled, but they had never requested the Board to redistrict the County, nor had 25 percent of the voters petitioned the Board to redistrict. The court concluded that the chancellor correctly found that &sect; 2870 was a perfect legal remedy.

The court held that the findings of the appeals referee and the commission were supported by the evidence and that the trial court should have accepted the findings because there was no charge of fraud.

The court held that the medical testimony justified the apportionment. All three of the doctors who testified said that the employee had a coronary disease, although none gave a specific percentage. However, under the second paragraph of &sect; 4 of the Mississippi Workmen's Compensation Law, Miss. Laws 1960, ch. 277; Miss.

Bushes on the road need to be cleared and a bridge had to be constructed over a stream. The landowners proposed access via the latter road. Allegedly, the builders' proposed road would split the landowners' property in two and make it unavailable for future development. Last, they alleged that the proposed road, 50 feet in width, was not reasonably necessary. The court reversed, and the matter was remanded. First, &sect; 8419 was constitutional. Second, while the value of the land actually taken for the private road was to be paid at its market value, no damages were assessed for the remainder of the landowners' property by reason of the taking, such as the affect on future development. Further, the viability of the alternate road proposed by the landowners was unclear from the proof and such facts needed further development. The case had to be reversed.</SPAN></P>

Appellant also alleged that it had computed its income tax return by the use of &quot;the manufacturer's formula&quot; as prescribed by Art. 247 of the Income Tax Regulations, 11 and 12.

The proprietors filed a demurrer, which the chancery court sustained. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that the original bill stated a cause of action under Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 1073 (1942). The demurrer to the original bill in this case should have been overruled, and that the proprietors' objection to being required to answer parts of the bill, believed by them to require answers tending to incriminate them, should have been brought to the attention of the court by proper pleading before the answer was made. A motion requesting a rule of court, on the particular answer required by the bill, and believed by defendants to tend to incriminate them, was a method heretofore approved. The court also held that the proprietors' objection could also be brought to the attention of the chancery court in the answer, without answering the particular objectionable paragraph, until a ruling had been made on the objection by the chancery court.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The livestock corporation purchased anthrax vaccine from the chemical company and properly administered it to its cattle. It filed suit against the chemical corporation and process for the chemical corporation was served on the Secretary of State. The chemical corporation appeared specially and solely for the purposes of objecting to the jurisdiction of the trial court. Its motion to dismiss was granted. On appeal, the court noted that the livestock corporation asserted that the trial court had jurisdiction because the chemical corporation, in conformance with the Mississippi Economic Poisons Act of 1950, Miss. Code &sect; 5000-01 et seq. (Recomp. 1942), had appointed the Secretary of State as its agent for service of process and therefore submitted to the jurisdiction of the trial court. The court held that the Act did not apply to vaccines, and the Act when read in its entirety did not apply to the chemical corporation in a suit such as the livestock corporation's suit. The chemical corporation was not doing business within the state to subject it to the trial court's jurisdiction. The trial court properly sustained the motion to dismiss for its lack of jurisdiction.</SPAN></P>

The court further found that the finance commission's order was not arbitrary and capricious.

The court also held that the appeal from the finance commission allowed under Miss.

The company sought to enjoin defendant, the City of Jackson, Mississippi, from enforcing an order denying its request to rezone certain property owned by the company. A petition to intervene as defendants was filed by thirteen citizens. The intervenors and the City filed demurrers, which were sustained and the company appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company argued that the action of the City was void because when the city limits was extended and the property taken into the city the zoning ordinances adopted by the county board of supervisors terminated insofar as the company's property was concerned and such property was unzoned so that the City, until it had taken the necessary legal steps, had no jurisdiction over zoning of this particular property. The court on appeal was unable and unwilling to accept as law the proposition that when property which had been zoned by the county was taken into the city it came as unzoned property. The record disclosed that the company was interested in the zoning of this particular property because, as shown by the order of the City Council, they appeared and objected to rezoning it, and as shown by the petition to intervene, they were objecting to it again. The court on appeal held that City was authorized to take the action it did. The court on appeal also found that &sect; 1195, Code of 1942 (Mississippi), provided for an appeal from municipal orders. Accordingly, all the questions raised by the company's bill could have been determined on appeal, and the demurrer was properly sustained.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged with armed robbery of a service station. The operator of the station identified defendant as the perpetrator. There was corroborating evidence of defendant's guilt such as identification of the vehicle that defendant drove to commit the robbery, the sunglasses defendant was wearing, and the gun used in the robbery. Defendant asserted an alibi defense. Defendant's motion to quash a special venire on the ground that only 11 out of the 40 jurors called were available was overruled. Affirming, the court held that the conviction was supported by ample evidence. The jury was warranted in accepting the operator's testimony because it was consistent and believable. The alibi's time sequence left defendant ample time to commit the robbery. The evidence of defendant's arrest was proper to show the legality thereof. The trial court followed the proper procedure under Code &sect; 1795 (Mississippi) when the special venire was exhausted, and there was no showing that defendant was prejudiced thereby or that the jury was not impartial.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Wife, individually and on behalf of her children, filed a lawsuit against the railroad for her husband's wrongful death. The chancellor found that the crossing was an unusually dangerous one; that the railroad had notice of that condition, but failed to take any precautions; that the husband was contributorily negligent in driving at an excessive speed, but a proximate cause of his death was the railroad's failure, with notice, to take any adequate precautions for the public at the crossing. The decree awarded complainants damages. The railroad appealed asserting that the sole, proximate cause of his death was his own negligence. The court held that the freight cars were difficult to observe, that the crossing was obscured and somewhat confused by lights from a plant and obstruction by buildings, and that the railroad's president recognized that those problems, which was more than ordinarily dangerous, required special precautions. The court agreed husband was negligent. Plus, it found that the trial court admitted expert testimony and opinion evidence in error, discharging the function of the jury, but that such error did not result in prejudicial harm warranting a reversal.</SPAN></P>

The Board adopted an order zoning out the sale of beer and wine in a strip of land one-half mile wide bordering the counties of Montgomery and Grenada.

The court held that from the findings of the Board, the sale of beer and light wine along the county line in which such sale was prohibited, constituted a difficult law enforcement problem.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants were found guilty of contributing to the delinquency of three minors by selling to them beer and whiskey. They appealed, arguing that the youth court had no jurisdiction over the trial of misdemeanors in which a person was charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The court noted that the apparent confusion arose from the fact that &sect; 7185-13 was one out of the 30 sections in the 1946 Mississippi Youth Court Act (Act). The court found that its five previous decisions with reference to &sect; 7185-13 held that the statute created the offense as a misdemeanor and that it was a separate offense. The provisions of &sect; 7185-13, and the other limiting provisions of the Act, reflected a legislative intent to provide a criminal statute creating a specific misdemeanor, which had to be enforced in the regular criminal courts of the state. It could not be enforced by the youth court. The court concluded that the conviction of defendants by the youth court was beyond its jurisdiction and invalid.</SPAN></P>

The milk processors were profiting from the sale of lower-priced milk products and stood to lose money as a result of the commission's order.

The milk commission claimed that the price fixing provisions were a proper exercise of the state's police power. The court held that (1) the legislature's findings that the milk industry was affected with a public interest and that the regulations imposed in the Milk Control Act were necessary to the general welfare were presumed to be true and the act was presumed to be constitutional; (2) the milk processors failed to show that the legislature's findings were false; and (3) the price fixing regulations imposed constituted a valid exercise of the state's police power and were paramount to the milk processors' constitutional rights.</SPAN></P>

The judgment failed to show that either defendant or his parents were served with legal process or that they appeared voluntarily. In order for the court to give validity to the trial court's judgment, process had to be issued and served upon defendant.

The motion was denied, so they filed a petition for habeas corpus relief. The petition was dismissed. The prisoners appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the petition was not based on any extraneous facts or circumstances affecting the integrity of the judgment of conviction. It was based solely on the contention that &sect; 2142.5 did not validly provide for imprisonment in the penitentiary, so it was not a felony statute. When there was uncertainty in the body of an act, the title could be resorted to for the purpose of ascertaining legislative intent and relieving ambiguity. Considering the title and body of the act together, it was manifest that the legislature intended for someone convicted under the statute to be subject to the stated fine or imprisonment in the penitentiary.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was initially convicted of murder and, on habeas corpus review, his conviction was reversed due to racial discrimination in the petit and grand juries in the county of trial.

He challenged his conviction by direct appeal, but the court held that the judgment of the federal court of appeals was the law of the case and res judicata of the issue of the validity of the indictment, so that defendant could not contest it. In affirming his conviction, the court held that an employee of the state government was not disqualified as a juror in a criminal case merely because he was a government employee. The court also held that it was proper for the victim's spouse to hire a special prosecutor to assist the prosecuting attorney, and that the fact that that the special prosecutor was proven popular by his election as governor did not disqualify him. A jury instruction stating that it was the jury's duty to consider defendant's case as if he were a white man was properly refused, since it was improper in Mississippi to call attention to defendant's race.</SPAN></P>

Code &sect; 5160 (1942), prior to the meeting of the board, or in treating the findings as confidential. The court held that the bank, by its own actions, was responsible in part for the error complained of and was estopped to take advantage of the board's failure to make the findings of the comptroller available for inspection during the hearing. Additionally, in affirming the decision of the lower court, the court held that there was substantial evidence to support the order of the board because the prospective incorporators were not required to show that the existing bank was not rendering adequate service to its customers, or that a new bank would be in a position to render better service to the public than the bank already in existence.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a county board of education, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of Jones County (Mississippi), which was entered upon a jury verdict in favor of appellee, a mother of a high school student. The mother had filed an action against the board, seeking review of the board's refusal to transfer the student to a certain high school. The mother had appealed the board's original decision under &sect; 6334-03, Code of 1942, Recompiled.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The school in a community was reduced from twelve to eight grades, necessitating the assignment of certain pupils elsewhere. Two alternative schools were available. For the 1957-1958 school session, the mother's daughter attended one of the alternative schools. However, as the 1958-1959 term approached, the board made it known that the daughter and other students would be required to attend the other alternative school. Petitions were unsuccessfully filed for a transfer back to the prior alternative school, and, after a hearing under &sect;6334-03, the board again refused to make the transfers. From that order, the mother appealed to the circuit court, which ruled for the mother and overruled the board's motion for a new trial. Reversing, the court held that the evidence of the mother wholly failed to show that the action of the board, in denying the transfer with respect to her daughter, was not supported by substantial evidence, was arbitrary and capricious, transcended its power to make, or violated a statutory or constitutional right of the minor. The circuit court therefore erred in refusing to grant the board's requested peremptory instruction.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment and entered its own judgment for the board, reinstating the board's order.</SPAN></P>

Appellants sought to have a deed to land from the United States to the City cancelled as a cloud upon their title, on the ground that the land reversed to them.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States Secretary of War had filed a petition for condemnation of the landowner's land in order to expand a military airfield. The landowner had accepted the award of compensation. He subsequently died. Several years later, the United States conveyed the land to the City. The City had appointed the Commission. The proceedings for condemnation were filed under several federal acts, including 25 Stat. 357; 26 Stat. 316, as amended by 40 Stat. 241, 50 U. S. C. S. &sect;&sect; 171, and Public Law - 507 -- 77th Congress; 10 U. S. C. S. &sect;&sect; 1343a-1343c; and 10 U. S. C. S. &sect;&sect; 1343a-1343c. Affirming, the court determined that the complaint was properly dismissed. The rule of strict construction against a condemnor and in favor of a landowner did not apply when the United States was the condemnor. The United States power to condemn was only limited by the Fifth Amendment. The United States, having filed its declaration stating the need to condemn the land, had the right to appropriate it. The decision was not subject to review as long as the government made an award of fair compensation to a landowner.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that there was no merit in the contention that the assessment of the penalty was invalid because of the failure of the Commissioner to issue a warrant for the collection of the tax before undertaking to impose the penalty. The court further held that he assessment of the penalty was not invalid because of the failure of the statute to provide for a hearing upon the question of the taxpayer's liability for the penalty or for a review of the action of the commissioner in imposing the penalty. However, the court held that the penalty clause of Miss. Code &sect; 9220-24 was invalid under the state and federal constitutions because the Legislature could not delegate such uncontrolled and arbitrary power to the Commissioner and the attempt to do was violative of the State Constitution and the due process clauses of the State Constitution and U.S. Const. amend. XIV. Accordingly, the court reversed the imposition of the penalty and remanded the action for the entry of an order requiring the Commissioner to accept the tendered payment.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The insurance commission denied filing the insurance company's all-inclusive packaged insurance policy because the policy did not designate premium rates for the fire loss portion. On appeal, the court affirmed. While the policy proposal included coverage that was regulated by several statutes, there was nothing in the Casualty Act to indicate that the Fire Rating Act was amended or annulled. As such, the insurance company failed to comply with the filing requirements of the Fire Rating Act and was ineligible to obtain filing of this policy. To allow this policy to be filed would result in a judicial repeal. Further, the rate was based on factors not permitted in the Rate Act, and to allow additional factors would eliminate the uniformity created by the Act. Finally, the Rating Bureau did not violate federal antitrust laws, for it only reported and made recommendations to the commission, which was a government agency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The lot owner was unable to disclose the commercial purpose to which her property could be diverted in the event the petition was granted, which meant that she could convey the lot to any person, firm, or corporation for any commercial use permitted by the general zoning ordinance in effect at that time without regard to what effect such action could have on the residential value of other property in that immediate area. The court held that although there were numerous objections to the sufficiency of the bill of exceptions, it was unnecessary to address them. Generally, a court would not interfere in zoning matters or substitute its own judgment for that of the municipality; however, zoning was subject to judicial review as to whether it was reasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory, confiscatory, or an abuse of discretion. Courts would not set aside the municipality's classification unless its invalidity was clear. Here, there was nothing to show that either the board or the mayor and commissioners acted arbitrarily, capriciously or unreasonably in rejecting the petition.

Defendant contended that the affidavit of charge did not state a crime known to the State of Mississippi, as required by Miss. Laws 1958, Chapter 279.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a 1937 election, voters reserved unto themselves the right to possess beer in the county for personal consumption. Chapter 252, Miss. Laws 1956, enacted subsequently render unlawful possession of beer for personal consumption in a county, which prior to the enactment of that statute had prohibited traffic in beer, but not its possession. That law was amended by Miss. Laws 1958, Chapter 279, amended Chapter 252, Laws 1956, making such possession illegal. The affidavit charging defendant cited the 1937 law. The court reversed and held that it should have cited the 1958 law, thus the affidavit did not charge a crime under the 1958 act, in force at the time of the alleged violation. While it was not necessary for the affidavit to have designated the particular statute claimed to have been violated, the affidavit was fatally flawed in that it affirmatively and expressly stated in effect that the accused had beer in his possession illegally as a result of the 1937 election, which election did not render possession of beer unlawful. Miss. Laws 1958, Chapter 279 was found to be constitutional and valid, and it stated an enforceable and definite offense.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An island was the subject of proposed development. The court found that the proof was ample to show that the project was feasible from an engineering and economic standpoint. The chancellor had found upon ample evidence that the development was of public interest and would have been in the best interest of the public locally and generally, and that the project would not have been feasible without reclaiming submerged lands surrounding the island. The taxpayers, however, argued that the contract between the Commission and the corporation constituted a joint venture, and that such joint undertaking was invalid as being a loan of municipal credit to the private corporation. The court agreed finding that the contract did in fact constitute a joint enterprise whereby the public agency contributed land and capital and the corporation contributed land. Therefore, the court held that the contract was void and that the provision of 1958 Miss. Laws ch. 814 of the Local and Private Laws, as amended, authorizing the sale or lease of reclaimed submerged lands was unconstitutional and void under Miss. Const. &sect; 90(u) (1890).</SPAN></P>

The court observed that the language of &sect; 9220-09(2) was plain and unambiguous and clearly authorized the interest deduction taken by the taxpayer on its return. The court stated that considering the plain language of &sect; 9220-09(2), its conflict with Article 105 of Regulations 11 of the Income Tax Division of the State Tax Commission was apparent. The court pointed out that it appeared a self-evident fact that in undertaking to enforce the tax shown to be due when computed under Article 105 the result was the imposition of an additional income tax assessed against the taxpayer by the State Tax Commission. The court remarked that the Commission was of course without power and authority to impose income taxes not authorized by statute.</SPAN></P>

The court also held that the charity's establishment of a trust from the proceeds of the gift did not take the gift outside of the applicable state law provisions.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company alleged that it was improperly charged with tax imposed by the Sales Tax Law and sought to recover the amount paid. The trial court rendered a decree in favor of the company for a refund of the portion of the tax paid and found that the tax constituted a burden in violation of U.S. Const. art.

In reversing, the court held that the Sales Tax Law required that the company should have kept adequate records in order that the Commission could have determined how much the taxpayer owed the State. If the taxpayer was having to pay more taxes on the amount received for services performed than it would have had to pay thereon if a part of its total income had been apportioned to the Tulsa, Oklahoma office, the increased exaction would have been due to the failure of the taxpayer to keep adequate records in order that the proper allocation could be made.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, Attorney General of Mississippi and others, disputed the dismissal of a petition for a writ of mandamus to require appellee county board of supervisors to call an election as provided in Chapter 188, Laws of 1956, as part of appellants' attempt to have the sheriff and tax collector removed from office. The circuit court dismissed the petition due to the Attorney General's refusal to produce documents in the hands of the Governor.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The main foci at trial were the Governor's finding that 30 percent of the qualified electors signed the petition and whether any fraud was involved in his decision. The circuit court's dismissal necessarily declined to grant appellants' motion to exclude all the evidence and to order the writ. On appeal, the court held, based on Chapter 188, that, in the mandamus proceedings, the circuit court could not lawfully inquire into anything not appearing on the face of the judgment of the removal council or the Governor's findings. Thus, the dismissal based on the failure to produce records was error and the writ should have been ordered unless Chapter 188 was unconstitutional. The court rejected appellees' claim that the judgment of the removal council was void because it was reached and signed outside the county. Because the constitutionality of Chapter 188 was an issue of law properly developed, it required no decision of a factual nature, and it might resolve the case, the court had to decide the issue. The court held that Chapter 188 was a constitutional exercise of the legislature's plenary power in regard to political questions validly enacted under &sect; 139 of the state constitution.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the circuit court and entered judgment directing the circuit court to order the issuance of the writ of mandamus as prayed for in the petition.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner Attorney General appealed an order of the Circuit Court of Warren County (Mississippi), which sustained a motion that was treated as a general demurrer to the complaint against defendants, the Board of Supervisors of Warren County. The object of the complaint was to enjoin the board from diverting tolls received from the operation of a bridge into a fund used for general revenue purposes.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The County had issued bonds to fund the purchase of a bridge. The controversy arose when the County established an &quot;Adequate Return Fund&quot; to which toll revenues were diverted. Another fund was maintained for payment of the bonds and maintenance of the bridge. The &quot;Adequate Return Fund&quot; was to provide a reasonable rate of return on the County's investment in the bridge. The Fund was used for general revenue purposes unrelated to the bridge. The trial court upheld the Fund and the attorney general appealed. The court reversed, holding that &sect; 11 of the Bridge Revenue Bond Act, Chapter 283, Laws of 1938 (Mississippi) required that the toll revenues be spent only on maintenance of the bridge and payment of principal and interest on the bonds. Section 13 of that Act provided that tolls were to stop when the bridge was paid. Therefore, the Act expressed an intention that the bridge was not to be a source of general revenue. Furthermore, the County had only powers expressly granted to it, and there was no power to use funds for other purposes. There was also no investment for which a rate of return would be allowable, because the bridge was paid for by the sale of bonds.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings consistent with the court's opinion that there was no statutory authority to spend funds received from bridge operations for general county revenue purposes.</SPAN></P>

After a third hearing, the chancellor entered a decree to not allow the individuals to adopt the child.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The issue presented was whether Miss. Laws ch. 10, &sect; 9 (1953), was constitutional; if so, whether in fact the superintendent failed to qualify under that statute; and whether the undisputed facts would permit any discretionary refusal of the writ. The court held that the act expressly stated that no one was eligible for the office unless he met certain specified requirements and it further made it unlawful for the election commissioners of any county to place the name of any person upon the ballot as a candidate for county superintendent of education who did not qualify under the terms of this act. The court held that it was undisputed under the superintendent's answer and stipulation, and his own testimony that he failed to comply with the act. Finally, the court held that because the classification within the act met the requirements of the law as to reasonableness, the act was constitutional. Therefore, the court held that the court's constitutional duty was to enforce the law as written and grant the relief prayed for by the State.

No appeal was taken under Miss. Code &sect; 1195 (Recomp 1942). Appellants' action, being a collateral attack on the resolution acknowledging a need for the Authority to function, was not maintainable. Similarly, appellants had failed to appeal to the circuit court after the Board rejected their petition to rescind its action declaring the need for the Authority. As the orders and resolutions of the Board were regular on their face, they could not be held null and void. Because the Boards had continued to find a need for benefits provided under the Act, it was not necessary for them to again call for a hearing and determination before they sought preliminary loans.

The court held that while ch. 252(b) prohibited the possession of beer and wine in dry counties that had held local option elections under ch. 252(a), Copiah County had not held any such election under ch. 252, which deleted a former provision permitting possession of beer for personal consumption, and, therefore, defendant's conviction was erroneous and had to be reversed. The court determined that Copiah County had held a local option election in 1937, at which time the people voted to prohibit all but the possession of beer for personal consumption, and thus, ch. 252(b) did not apply or render unlawful the possession of beer for personal consumption.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A Texas court claimed jurisdiction over a husband and awarded full custody of the couple's children to the wife. She took that decision to the Chancery Court of Pearl River County (Mississippi) where the children were living with their father. It held that the Mississippi court that had granted the couple's divorce had retained jurisdiction over the children, and its decision regarding custody was determinative. The wife appealed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">While the wife and children were in Texas, the husband petitioned the Mississippi court that granted the couple's divorce for a modification of the divorce decree, but process could not be served on the wife. The divorce court then awarded sole custody of the children to the husband. He filed a habeas corpus petition in a Texas court with a copy of the divorce court's most recent decision and asked that the decision be given full faith and credit. Process was obtained over the wife. The Texas court granted custody to the husband. He took the children to Mississippi. The wife obtained a reversal on appeal. The court held that (1) the divorce court's decree awarding sole custody of the children to the husband was void for want of legal process on the wife; (2) the proper venue for the wife's habeas proceeding was the chancery court; (3) because the husband had invoked the jurisdiction of a Texas court, its judgment was res judicata and entitled to full faith and credit by the Mississippi courts; and (4) as a result, the wife should have custody of the children as ordered by the Texas court unless there were subsequent events that warranted a change of custody.</SPAN></P>

Code of 1942, &sect;&sect; 5439-5462, Code of 1942, &sect; 1195, sought review of a judgment of the Circuit Court of DeSoto County (Mississippi) approving and affirming an order of a county board of supervisors that had created and incorporated appellee power district.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The power district argued that the utility company and taxpayers lacked standing. The utility company and taxpayers contended that the board had failed to give notice of the election authorizing creation of the power district. The court reversed the judgment and rendered judgment. The court determined that the utility company came within the category of a person aggrieved or adversely affected by the board's order and that the taxpayers qualified also. The court observed that the order creating the district failed to affirmatively adjudicate that any notice of the election had been published and if so, how, where, and when and that the record did not reflect any other order of the board on its minutes so adjudicating. The court stated that Miss. Code &sect;&sect; 5441(9), 5460, directing a liberal interpretation of the Act, did not warrant the omission of such due process, procedural, and jurisdictional requirements in the organization of a power district. The court noted that the Act expressly required publication of notice of the election and did not change the jurisdictional requirements for actions of the board. The court stated that the order creating the power district was invalid.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The testator, who was a resident of Illinois, left the balance of his estate after certain specific bequests to various charities, none of which was located in Mississippi. The total value of the testator's estate was $ 2,211,222.22, of which $ 332,984.29 was located in Mississippi. The State Tax Commission contended that the entire gross estate located in Mississippi was liable to the inheritance tax, but the trial court agreed with the executors that the Commission should grant a deduction for charity based on the proportion that the gross Mississippi estate bore to the entire gross estate. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment, holding that Miss. Code Ann. &sect; 9271(1) (1942), which applied to deductions of a nonresident decedents, required a comparison of the gross estate in Mississippi to the total gross estate of a decedent and applied a proportion formula to nonresidents making gifts to any and all charities. Thus, the trial court correctly allowed a charitable deduction under the proportional formula of &sect; 9271(1).</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant stated that the proof offered by the Governor failed to show a breakdown of law enforcement conditions in Jones County, which justify the action on the Governor's part. The court on appeal found that in the executive order the Governor specifically found and recited that such conditions did exist. The court on appeal did not decide whether the Governor would be the sole judge as to whether such conditions did exist. The recitals in the executive order made out a prima facie case justifying the Governor's action. The duty was upon defendant to overcome such fact, which was not done. A copy of the executive order, duly certified by the Secretary of State, was admitted in evidence. Defendant argued that such copy was inadmissible. The Secretary of State had the authority and power to authenticate a true copy of the original which was duly on file in his office. Defendant argued that the proof did not show that this slot machine was a gaming or gambling device. The question of whether it was such a device was properly submitted to the jury under the instructions of the State and defendant. It was tried on the theory of fact as to whether it was such a device.</SPAN></P>

The court affirmed and held that the portions of the answer and exhibits stricken were not germane to the issues in the case. The court rejected the argument that the tax assessment was valid on the ground that the board of supervisors failed to give proper notice of their meeting for hearing assessment objections. The court held that board properly published notice to the public and taxpayers of the county of the meeting times. The board met on several different days and did not finally adjourn until all objections were heard. The court rejected the argument that the landowner did not get notice of the expiration date for redemption because under Miss.

The board adopted a formal resolution and order providing for the issuance of the bonds, which were duly received and sold, subject to the approval of their validity. Over the taxpayers' objections, the chancellor entered a decree validating the bonds, and the taxpayers appealed. The court held that the legislature had the power to consider and act upon the subject matter stated in House Bill No. 278, the law was constitutionally enacted, and it did not conflict with or otherwise violate any provisions of the state or federal constitutions. The court found while there was no constitutional or statutory requirement that notice be given to the taxpayers and an opportunity for a hearing before the bonds were ordered issued, the taxpayers were given the right to challenge the validity of the bonds in the validation proceedings and a full hearing on all questions raised by the objections filed, and thus, the requirements of due process were fully met.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The company was an Illinois corporation, but had its principal office in New Orleans, Louisiana and preformed dredging operations on the Mississippi River. The commission assessed an additional income tax for two tax years. The trial court affirmed the findings of the commission and the company appealed. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the statute of limitations did not apply to bar the assessments because the commission sustained and approved the assessments less than three years from the date of the filing of the return. Further, the court ruled that the burden was on the company to show that its extraterritorial values were being taxed or affected and that the company could not complain unless it could show that the commission's method was arbitrary and unreasonable. The court held that the formula, upon which the company based its returns, was applicable to manufacturing and that dredging did not fall into the category of manufacturing.

The trial court overruled their motion, dismissed the complaint against the female sellers on the ground of insufficient evidence, and entered a decree against the male sellers. On appeal, the court affirmed that portion of the order that dismissed the bill against the female seller. However, it reversed the decree against the male sellers, holding that they were immune from liability for penalties. The court determined the Miss. Code &sect; 2630, which prohibited the assessment of a penalty against an individual who was required to incriminate himself, applied. The trial court should not have compelled the male sellers to answer that part of the complaint that incriminated them unless it intended to give them immunity from the penalties sought in the action. It was thus manifest the under &sect; 2630, the male sellers were exempt from the assessment of fines after they were required to give self-incriminating answers to the complaint.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporate taxpayer filed suit against the tax commissioner seeking a refund of certain sales taxes. The court affirmed the circuit court's judgment finding the taxpayer liable for sales taxes on its vending machine operations under a concessionaire contract since the evidence supported the finding that the taxpayer owned the merchandise sold and passed title to the purchasers from the vending machines. The court ruled that the circuit court properly granted a directed verdict for the taxpayer under a rental contract for vending machines located inside an Air Force base. Under the terms of the rental contract, the sales were those of the Air Force and there was no evidence that there was an abandonment or deviation from the contract. The Air Force was the dominant party under the rental contract and was also the owner of the merchandise. The taxpayer only serviced and stocked the machines. There was no evidence that the rental contract was made for the purpose of circumventing the sales tax laws. The court reversed the circuit court's order denying the taxpayer's motion for a directed verdict on its claim for a refund of taxes illegally collected by means of a warrant.</SPAN></P>

When the debtor transferred property to his wife, the creditors filed an action to set aside the deed, arguing that the transfer was made to defraud creditors.

Because the property was transferred for a nominal consideration, there was a presumption that it was fraudulent. Part of the property was the debtor and his wife's homestead. The trial court erred when it gave them only a $ 3,000 exemption because the exemption in Mississippi Code &sect; 317 had been raised to $ 5,000. The decree for damages was not entered until after the effective date of the amendment. The judgment was for a tort; therefore, the prohibition on the impairment of existing contracts contained in Miss. Const. &sect; 16 and U.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10 did not apply.</SPAN></P>

The inmate was convicted of the murder and sentenced to death by electrocution. He claimed that his imprisonment in the condemned row was unconstitutional because he was caused mental anguish by the attendant remainders of the impending executions of others that increased the severity of his punishment. He also argued that he was confined under an ex post facto law that changed the manner of inflicting the death penalty. The court affirmed the order denying the inmate's petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court found that the statute passed after his conviction did not repeal the law providing for the inflicting of death in capital cases by electrocution but allowed the one sentenced to choose between electrocution or the gas chamber. Thus the new law did not change the method of inflicting the death penalty except by the choice of the condemned. The court also found that the inmate could not complain of his confinement in the maximum security cell block because he could have been confined in the same condition even if he had been acquitted of the murder.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancery court found that the statute violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution because it was an arbitrary and discriminatory classification of chain picture shows for the purpose of taxation. The statute levied an additional three percent tax on gross revenue derived from the sale of admissions against operators of more than 10 picture shows. The operator owned 36 picture shows, 14 of which were in the State. Upon review, the court found that the tax was a license tax. The classification that increased the rate was whether the operator had more than 10 stores in its chain group. The court concluded that the classification was within the constitutional power of the legislature and that the provision of the statute that imposed the additional three percent tax on operators of more than 10 stores did not violate the equal protection clause. Further, the court found that the operator was not entitled to the refund because it was merely the conduit through which the tax was paid by the purchases of picture show tickets. To allow the operator to recover the tax would violate the doctrine of &quot;unjust enrichment.&quot;</SPAN></P>

Noting that the photographer's license did not deprive the city of authority to regulate his method of operation, that Code &sect; 3374-131 authorized the city to regulate transient vendors, that the ordinance was regulatory, not prohibitory, and that the ordinance did not prevent the photographer from conducting business altogether, the court held that the ordinance was a reasonable regulation of transient vendors within the city's police power and was valid insofar as it prohibited solicitation at private residences. However, insofar as the ordinance prohibited transient vendors from going in an on nonresidential private property and buildings, it was not a reasonable exercise of municipal power authorized by Code &sect; 3374-131.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee taxpayers filed a motion to dismiss the challenge of appellants, state highway officials, of a decree of the Circuit Court of Jones County (Mississippi), which overruled the officials' demurrer to the taxpayers' action that sought to enjoin the officials from proceeding with the proposed construction of a freeway through a city to become part of the Mississippi State Highway System.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The bill alleged that the construction of the freeway would cause unnecessary mass destruction of houses and would result in the unnecessary expenditure of public funds. The officials contended that there was no equity on the face of the bill and that the taxpayers had a full and complete remedy at law. In overruling the motion to dismiss, affirming the decree, and remanding for further proceedings, the court held that the appeal involved the question of the jurisdiction of the chancery court. The chancery court had jurisdiction to determine the question of the necessity for the proposed freeway under the allegations of the amended bill. The bill sufficiently alleged that the officials' action in undertaking to proceed with the proposed freeway in accordance with the proposed plan of construction was arbitrary and constituted an abuse of discretion. An answer and a hearing of the cause on its merits were required.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayers challenged the validity of the Act Authorizing the Board of Supervisors of the County to Issue Bonds, which authorized the bonds issued by the county, and a one cent gasoline excise tax to pay for the bonds. The proceeds from the bonds were to pay for roads and bridges. The taxpayers claimed that the gasoline excise tax and bond authorization was unconstitutional. The trial court entered judgment in favor of the county. The court reversed and entered judgment in favor of the taxpayers. The court held that the Act violated the State and U.S. Constitutions. The court found that Miss. Const. &sect; 90 prohibited the legislature from passing a special or local law to pay for the work on roads and highways. The bonds were properly issued, but the gasoline excise tax, applicable only to the county, was a local law that contradicted &sect; 90. The court also found that the Act denied equal protection under the U.S. Const. amend. 14, by applying the excise tax only to the residents of the county and not to others. The court found that the Act had no reasonable or just grounds on which the legislature based its classification.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Chancery Court of Forrest County (Mississippi), which affirmed a judgment of a county court granting a decree against appellant in an action by appellee, the Mississippi State Tax Collector, to recover statutory penalties due the state and county for the unlawful sale of intoxicating liquors, pursuant to &sect; 2639 of the Mississippi Code of 1942.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant first contended that the county court was without jurisdiction to try the cause while sitting as an equity court. The court held that the constitutional question now raised was previously passed upon in the case of Moore v. General Motors Acceptance Corporation and that there was no reason to depart from its reasoning. It was argued, however, that appellant was deprived of the right of trial by jury. That question was answered adversely to appellant in the case of Bishop v. Bailey. Moreover, appellant, in his answer to the bill of complaint, admitted the sale of the intoxicating liquor in question. Thus, if the case had been on the law docket instead of the equity docket of the county court, the Tax Collector would have been entitled to a peremptory instruction and there would have been nothing in the case to be submitted to a jury. It was also argued that the Tax Collector was engaged in the collection of the Black Market Tax and has not filed similar suits against persons paying that tax, and that for this reason the suit was discriminatory and the Tax Collector did not come into court with clean hands. That contention was also answered in the Bishop case.</SPAN></P>

The payments were reduced, by agreement, and the debtors defaulted on the payments. The property under the trust deed was sold. At trial, accountants for both parties testified that the rate of interest, aside from the acceleration clause, was greater than eight percent but less than 20 percent. The chancellor determined, however, that the acceleration clause constituted a contract to pay interest at 20 percent; thus it was usurious. The court reversed the judgment. The court held that if on default of payment, the entire indebtedness was to become due, the interest would not constitute usury even though it would exceed the legal rate. The court held, however, that the excess rate was penal and could not be collected.</SPAN></P>

At issue was the application of &sect;&sect; 1(i), 2, 4, Chapter 134 of the Laws of 1944 (Mississippi) (Act).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The United States leased certain lands in Mississippi to a third party; the lease provided that the United States was to have one-eighth of all oil produced from the land or one-eighth of the value of the oil. The third party and the company executed an operating agreement, and the company produced oil. The company paid the Mississippi oil severance tax imposed by the Act on the total production from the well. Thereafter, the company sought and was denied a refund of the taxes paid on the United States' one-eighth interest in the oil. On appeal, the court ruled that under of &sect;&sect; 1(i), 2, 4, of the Act, the severance tax was levied in the first instance on the &quot;producers&quot; of oil,&quot; and by the clear and judicially construed meaning of &sect; 1(i) of the Act, both the United States and the company were &quot;producers&quot; for the purposes of the Act. Under the statutory formula, the United States was a &quot;producer,&quot; and as such the Mississippi oil severance tax was levied upon it to the extent of its one-eighth interest. Consequently, the Act, insofar as it attempted to impose a severance tax upon the United States, was unconstitutional as violative of implied constitutional immunity.</SPAN></P>

The partnership operated a factory and processing plant in which shrimp and oysters were processed and shipped throughout the country. The partnership contended the parts and equipment purchased by it outside the state were not subject to the use tax because the parts and equipment went immediately into interstate commerce, and were thus continuously in interstate commerce from the time of their shipment from outside the state. On appeal of the judgment entered in the chairman's favor, the court affirmed because the use tax was properly levied and collected, and the tax was not a tax upon interstate commerce, but a tax upon the using, storing, or consuming of tangible personal property within the state.</SPAN></P>

The power to pardon included the power to commute sentences in criminal cases. This power could not be infringed upon by legislative enactment.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">An employee, a rider in the employer's truck, died when the truck collided with a car. When the circuit court sustained the employer's demurrer and barred the suit, the widow and her children appealed. Affirming, the court said that the Law did not violate any provision of the state or federal constitutions. The Law applied to all cases within its purview. The circuit judge was in error in holding the Law to be unconstitutional and in holding that the Law was applicable to the facts in the case. A demurrer to the employer's defense that the Law was the exclusive remedy should have been overruled. A hearing should have been granted to determine whether the employee's injury arose out of and in the course of his employment. The Law was not invalid under the Due Process clauses of the state or federal constitutions. The exclusion of companies with fewer than eight workers from the Law was not such an arbitrary classification as to deny the equal protection of the laws to any party. The Law was not invalid because it put all employees in one class or because it compensated persons of differing rights, ages, or family responsibilities under one standard of compensation.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant grantors brought an action against appellees, their grantee's transferee, and their son, to cancel a mineral deed and a subsequent conveyance on the grounds of fraud and forgery. The grantors appealed a decision from the Circuit Court of Jasper County (Mississippi), which held in favor of the transferee. Also before the court was the transferee's motion to strike the court reporter's transcript of the evidence and proceedings.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The grantors' main contention was that an instrument was represented to them as being an oil and gas lease instead of a mineral deed, and that a person represented himself as the grantee rather than the transferee. The transferee contended that he purchased an assignment from the grantee for a valuable consideration and without notice of any alleged fraud. The motion to strike was sustained by the court. Under &sect; 1640, Code of 1942, any person desiring to perfect an appeal had to notify the court reported, in writing, within 10 days after the adjournment of the trial court that a copy of the notes was desired if that person wanted to have the benefit of the evidence on appeal. Here, the grantors' notice was untimely and the transcript was not properly before the court. The court affirmed. Absent testimonial evidence, the record was barren of any proof of any alleged fraud or forgery. Although photostatic copies of the conveyances at issue were allegedly substituted for the originals as exhibits in the trial court, absent the transcript, there was no disclosure that the original deeds were actually introduced.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The physician was a licensed physician under the laws of Mississippi.

There was no substantial difference between the facts and controlling principles in these cases. The court noted that appellants still filed a lengthy brief raising substantially the same questions that were raised, passed upon, and settled by the United States Supreme Court in Busch.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioners filed a petition with the board of supervisors by which they sought to have a private road laid on the landowner's land. In the petition, it was indicated that petitioners signed it without agreeing to pay any costs or damages but that they would pay the cost of laying and constructing the road. Not all petitioners actually owned land that was to be served by the private road. Petitioners who did own property that was to be served by the private road had less convenient ingress and egress to their land from a public road. The board of supervisors granted the petition. The circuit court affirmed. On further review, the court reversed and found for the landowner. The court reasoned that petitioners did not allege in their petition that they had attempted to obtain an easement from the landowner or from other landowners by contract or purchase and petitioners had not offered to pay damages for the easement, which were required under &sect; 8419. Further, the court reasoned that petitioners who owned property to be served by the road had other means of ingress and egress, so there was no real necessity for the private road.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The chancery court committed defendants to jail for a period not exceeding two years or until they furnished the required bonds. A bill had been filed charging defendants with selling liquor and running a gambling establishment at their place of business. A temporary restraining order was granted, and subsequently a temporary injunction. After a trial, a decree was entered making the injunction permanent and requiring each defendant to execute a bond. Affirming, the court concluded that it was not justified in reversing the findings that defendants made an insufficient showing that they were unable to make the bonds and that defendants had not made a sufficient effort to obtain bonds. Inability to make a bond precluded a finding that a party was in contempt for not making it. The evidence showed however, that defendants had only asked four people, besides their wives, to execute the bonds. They had not approached a surety company. At least one of the persons approached misunderstood his obligation under the bond, which was minimal since defendants claimed to have sold their interest in the business. The evidence supported the findings.</SPAN></P>

The issue was whether the Commission's findings that the town had inadequate service was supported by substantial evidence and whether the order unduly burdened interstate commerce.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The train at issue was constructed, designed, and operated almost exclusively for high speed interstate passenger travel and mail. The running time of the train was its most important value because it competed with airline service. A September, 1951 order of the Interstate Commerce Commission reducing the train's speed on three-fourths of its route made it difficult for the train to maintain its schedule. There were six trains that stopped in the town at issue. The circuit court decided in favor of the railroad company because there was no substantial evidence to show general public necessity for the stop at issue but only proof of personal convenience for a few individuals and of currently adequate service. The court held that (1) the Commission's order was beyond its statutory powers because it resulted in substantial interference with and imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce; (2) there was no substantial support for the Commission's findings of public necessity and inadequate train service for the stop at issue; and (3) to require a stop at the town and at other similar towns would impair the train's purposes, functions, and efficiency.</SPAN></P>

Appellees contended, and the chancellor agreed, however, that Chapter 69 was violative of &sect; 121, Constitution of 1890 because the Governor, in his proclamation to convene the Legislature in extraordinary session, did not mention this subject as one for consideration. Thus, appellees were held to have rights in the land, not appellants. On review, the court reversed in part. The court found that chapter 69 was regularly enacted, and, in addition, it was approved by the Governor on August 20, 1938. The court reversed the decree by annulling the holding that appellees maintained an interest in land after the tax sale. However, the lower court did not address whether one appellant purchased more than 160 acres of public land in one year in alleged violation of &sect; 4108, Code of 1942, so that issue required resolution on remand.</SPAN></P>

The jury returned a verdict for plaintiffs and defendants appealed. The court affirmed, holding that the declaration in plaintiffs' complaint that the bus driver negligently brought his bus to a stop sufficiently alleged negligence, not only in the location of the stopped bus, but, by inference, in the manner in which it stopped. Moreover, the variance in the declaration and proofs were not so disparate as to raise surprise and the bus company's failure to object until the appeal was a surrender of its right to avail itself of the variance between the pleading and proofs. Further, the question of whether the bus driver's conduct was a proximate cause was a question for the jury, despite the action of the cattle truck driver in swerving into oncoming traffic because there could be more than one proximate cause of the accident.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The residents of the territory to be annexed appeared to the city's petition and filed an objection to the enlargement of certain boundaries, and presented a demurrer to the petition. The residents stressed that the determination of the question of public convenience and necessity was a legislative and not a judicial function. On appeal, the court determined that the provision of the act relative to the question of the public convenience and necessity was not sufficient of itself to strike down the entire act as unconstitutional, even assuming that the question of public convenience and necessity was a legislative question. The court concluded that the provisions of 1950 Miss. Laws Ch. 491, under and pursuant to which the ordinance in question was adopted, were not unconstitutional upon the grounds that they were in conflict with Miss. Const. art. 1, &sect;&sect; 1, 2. The court was of the opinion that the city's ordinance in general terms described the proposed improvements and stated the manner, nature, or character thereof and the extent thereof, and that the ordinance in that respect was sufficient to substantially comply with the statute.</SPAN></P>

The trial court, sitting as both judge and jury, found for the county and dismissed the cause with prejudice.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The amount sought by the town was the difference between the amount claimed by the town and the amount paid by the county by reason of oil severance tax funds returned to the county. There were a number of oil wells in the town. According to &sect; 3, Chapter 134, Laws of 1944 (Mississippi), the town was entitled to receive one-third of the oil severance taxes returned to the county. According to House Bill 115, Chapter 746, Laws of 1948, approved February 16, 1948 (Mississippi), the town was authorized to borrow money to build a water and sewerage system. Oil severance taxes were permitted to help raise money. However, Chapter 510, Laws of 1950 (Mississippi), amended Chapter 134, Laws of 1944 (Mississippi), so as to reduce the amount that the town could receive from the taxes to one-third of the tax produced in the municipality and returned to the county. The court found that the 1950 did not impair the town's contract with its bondholders. Thus, because there was no unconstitutional impairment, an affirmance was warranted.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The taxpayer owned and operated a pipe line used for the transportation of natural gas from Texas through five states, including Mississippi, and terminating in Illinois. As all of the taxpayer's operations were wholly and exclusively in interstate commerce, the taxpayer did not buy, sell, produce, or distribute gas in Mississippi. The state levied a privilege tax of $ 75 per mile for each of the taxpayer's 147 miles of pipe line in Mississippi. Although recognizing that the taxpayer paid ad valorem, franchise, and income taxes in Mississippi, the Commission made a final assessment of the privilege tax. On appeal, the court reversed the circuit court's judgment for the taxpayer. On suggestion of error, the court withdrew its former opinion upholding the privilege tax and sustained the suggestion of error by holding that the privilege tax on purely interstate business fell outside the field of legitimate state taxation by obstructing the flow of interstate commerce. Pursuant to recent federal appellate decisions, a state privilege tax upon purely interstate business operations was a direct violation of the Commerce Clause of the federal constitution and could not stand.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The employee was killed during the course and scope of his employment, and the Commission issued compensation for the widow and the parties' child.

Under the Act, &quot;widow&quot; was defined as a decedent's legal wife or one not a legal wife but who had entered into a ceremonial marriage with the decedent at least one year prior to his death.

Appellees contended that they should not have been compelled to share in the production from each unit in proportion to the actual surface acreage owned by them in the unit, but they were entitled to more royalty per acre than the other owners in the unit. The court held that this contention was foreclosed by the conservation law, Chapter 256, Laws of 1948 (Mississippi), for by paragraph (d) of Section 9 thereof it was expressly provided that anything herein contained to the contrary, notwithstanding, any allocation or apportionment of production were to have been made on the basis of and in proportion to the acreage content of the drilling units prescribed for the producing horizons for the pool.</SPAN></P>
