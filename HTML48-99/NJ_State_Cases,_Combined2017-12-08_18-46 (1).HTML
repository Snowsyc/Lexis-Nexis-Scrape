The trial court also held that the statute as applied was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court reversed.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, remaindermen of a testamentary trust and their representatives, and appellee, tenant in and current beneficiary of the trust, both sought review of a judgment entered by the Union County Court (New Jersey), judicially allowing an intermediate accounting filed in connection with its administration of the trust.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A corporate trustee sought court approval of a trust account, as well as advice as to whether stock dividends were allocable to principal or income. Appellant remaindermen and appellee, owner of the trust's &quot;net annual income,&quot; were parties. Appellee's share was one of two amounts, depending on what allocation method applied. The lower court held that appellee was entitled to the lesser amount, which still exceeded that which appellants said was due. Appellants and appellee sought review, and the court, certifying the case prior to appellate argument, affirmed. The court held that the &quot;Pennsylvania Rule,&quot; applicable to trusts before the 1952 passage of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3A:14A-1 et seq., wrongly compelled trustees to make complex and inequitable allocations of stock dividends to income, without regard for the dividend's true nature. The court held that under &sect; 3A:14A-1, based on the &quot;Massachusetts Rule,&quot; cash dividends were properly treated as income, and stock dividends were treated as principal. The court determined that the &quot;Pennsylvania Rule&quot; should be abandoned for pre-1952 trusts as well. The court remanded for further proceedings based on the newer rule.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed and remanded the lower court's ruling that a trustee's allocation of certain stock dividends to trust principal, instead of trust income, was proper because the requirement of allocation to income was based on the outmoded &quot;Pennsylvania Rule,&quot; rather than the modern &quot;Massachusetts Rule,&quot; which had become applicable in New Jersey.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, two corporations engaged in the business of distributing to retailers newspapers and magazines of all types, sought review of the lower court's decision convicting them of four counts of specific sales of obscene magazines and one count of possession with intent to sell obscene magazines. Defendants alleged that the lower court committed several errors. The court found that the lower court erred in permitting testimony from lay persons from the community regarding the &quot;contemporary community standards&quot; of the specific area. The court determined that the community standards as defined in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:115-2, necessarily referred to the standards of the United States at large, rather than those standards as defined by a lay person living in a specific location. The court also found that the search conducted at defendants' warehouse was improper because officers were provided with no exercise of informed discretion regarding what constituted obscenity. The court found that the search failed to assure the constitutional protection afforded to non-obscene material. As such, the court reversed and remanded for retrial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendants, Connecticut residents, sought review of the order of a Superior Court (New Jersey), which struck their affirmative defense that the personal injury action brought by plaintiffs, New Jersey residents, was barred by the statute of limitations. Defendants claimed that the tolling statute,&nbsp;N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-22, did not apply to the matter.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, New Jersey residents, filed an action against defendants, Connecticut residents, for injuries suffered in an automobile accident that occurred in New Jersey. Plaintiffs effected service by serving the director of motor vehicles, pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:7-2. The director forwarded the complaint to defendants in Connecticut. Defendants pled the statute of limitations in their answer, because the action was filed more than two years after the accident. The trial court granted plaintiffs' motion to strike the defense, and the matter was certified to the court, which affirmed the trial court's decision. The court held that the statute of limitations was tolled by the action of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:14-22, which provided that if defendants resided out of state when the action accrued, or left thereafter, the time during which they were out of state was not computed in the two-year limitation. The court rejected defendants' claim that the statute denied them equal protection of the laws by extending the time in which they were subject to suit. The court held that the statute was not without a rational basis; thus, it did not violate U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision striking the defense of defendants, Connecticut residents, that the personal injury action of plaintiffs, New Jersey residents, was barred by the statute of limitations. Defendants resided out of state. Thus, a tolling statute applied to plaintiffs' claim, and the action was not time-barred. The tolling statute was not a violation of equal protection guarantees.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:170-77.2a, 77.2b unconstitutional, and which ruled in favor of respondents, the state, attorney general, and county prosecutors. The statute required appellants to refrain from sending materials that news dealers advised them not to send.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, book and magazine distributors, challenged the constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:170-77.2a, 77.2b, which required them to refrain form sending news dealers materials that the dealers advised them not to send and to pick up any such material within two days after a dealer notified them of receipt. The statute was enacted to prevent distributors from distributing obscene publications and denying responsibility for them. The lower court found the statute constitutional, and the court affirmed. The court found that the statute did not deny due process of law because its restrictions were not arbitrary and it was reasonably related to a lawful legislative purpose. The fact that appellants had to retrieve unwanted materials sooner than was their current practice did not make the statute unconstitutional, and the statute was construed to apply only to willful failure to timely remove the material. The court held that the statute did not violate U.S. Const. amend. I because it did not involve pre-censorship. The statute did not violate the equal protection clause because it did not invidiously discriminate between newspapers and other materials.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the decision that a statute regulating the distribution of unrequested material to news dealers was constitutional.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant water company challenged the judgment that ordered appellant to absorb the cost of relocation of its facilities in appellee port authority's action for the cost of improvements. New Jersey and New York adopted a plan for the development of the port which contemplated bridges, tunnels, and sundry terminal facilities. Appellant argued that a utility would be required to relocate at its own cost only when an order to relocate was given by an authority that possessed the police power to give the order. Appellant argued that the state, as the ultimate sovereign over public roads, had that power, and that it had not been delegated to the appellee in express terms. The court affirmed the judgment and held that all activity of a state and its subdivisions and agencies rested upon the police power. The power to undertake any project was part of the power to provide for the public well-being and comfort, and that power was the police power. The court held that appellee was an agent of both the state of New York and New Jersey, and the improvements were for the substantial benefit of the millions of citizens that lived and worked in the two states.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, United States and testator, challenged an inheritance transfer tax assessment by respondent Taxation Department of New Jersey on testator's estate, which was bequeathed to the United States. The United States suggested that the tax was in fact a tax on the property of the federal sovereignty and, therefore, violated the supremacy clause. The court held that there was nothing in the supremacy clause, which so limited the broad power of a state to regulate testamentary disposition of property as to bar exemption from the tax for transfers to itself, while such transfers to the federal government were made taxable. The United States also asserted that the bequest, if taxable, should be treated as property passing in trust for an exclusively charitable purpose, and taxable at five percent rather than eight percent as assessed. A bequest to the United States used for the national defense obviously benefitted the general public. The United States should have been treated as the recipient of a bequest for a charitable use, and the tax rate should have been five percent rather than eight percent. The court modified the tax assessment and, as modified, was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

The very purpose of respondent's leasing arrangement was to make an athletic and recreational facility available to its citizens. That purpose was known to appellant and was implemented by an unequivocal condition in the lease. Appellant knew that it was dealing with a public body acting under public obligation to the residents of respondent. However, appellant conducted itself as a private golf club. The argument of alleged necessity advanced during the depression was no longer pertinent.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant land owner had property in an area zoned for industrial use, and part of the land was subject to a newly adopted zoning regulation, the meadows development zone that restricted land use in high water table areas. Appellant wanted to fill the road edge with excess material from gravel pit operations and to take other prohibited actions. Appellant applied for and was denied a zoning variance by appellee zoning board. Appellant then challenged the constitutionality of appellee township's zoning ordinance. The lower court affirmed, and the court reviewed the issue on certified appeal. The court reversed, finding that the zoning regulation was unconstitutional because it prevented all productive land use by private owners, rather than adopting reasonable conditions for private land development. As such, the regulation was unreasonable and confiscatory. The prime object of the regulations was to retain the land in its natural state. The court directed the lower court to enter judgment that would become effective for a period of time considered necessary in order to enact new regulations for the area.</SPAN></P>

The commissioner determined that compliance with these two provisions was mandatory. Appellant's requested certificate of authority to transact business as a medical service corporation was denied. Appellant brought an action in the law division arguing the two provisions were unconstitutional. The trial court transferred the case to the appellate division where appellant sought review of the commissioner's determination.

Appellant contended that respondent's order of license revocation and payment of penalty constituted an unconstitutional interference with interstate commerce. The court held that the local character of the transactions provided strong support that reasonable state regulation of the sales was permissible even if recognition was given to their interstate aspects. The court found that the amount of the penalty stemmed from respondent's finding that appellant willfully devised an illegal scheme to circumvent the minimum price structure established for milk sales. However, the court did not believe the substantial evidence supported that view. The court held that the portion of the penalty, which imposed the $ 25,000, was excessive, and it was reduced to $ 1,000. The order for revocation of appellant's license was to be recalled if the penalty was paid within 30 days.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff merchant was a seller of vending machines which, among other things, were used for the distribution of prophylactics. Plaintiff challenged the constitutionality of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:170-76, which forbid the public exposure of contraceptives without just cause. This statute was used to justify confiscation of plaintiff's machines. The court affirmed the trial court's judgment that &sect; 2A:170-76 was constitutional, rejecting plaintiff's argument that the use of the phrase &quot;without just cause&quot; made this statute void for vagueness. The court noted that the use of the phrase &quot;without just cause&quot; had been upheld as being lawful in past decisions. The court also found that the application of &sect; 2A:170-76 to halt the use of vending machines to distribute contraceptives comported with the statute's legislative intent and that the policy of regulating contraceptive was within the hands of the state legislature and not the court system.</SPAN></P>

About a year after the proceedings began, defendant executed a deed for an undivided one-tenth interest in the land to his brother, an attorney in New York. Prior to a compensation for the taking trial, the brother filed a demand on intervention, alleging ownership in the land. Both the trial court and the appellate court denied the intervention because the brother did not provide an affidavit detailing the dates of execution or recording of the deed. On appeal, defendant sought review of the compensation for the taking award, and his brother joined in attacking the refusal of the lower courts in granting him permission to intervene. The court affirmed the award granted to defendant and affirmed the denial of the brother's application to intervene. No explanation had been given as to why, so late in the process, defendant decided to deed to his brother an interest in the land. The brother never provided the lower courts with the required affidavit.

Fundamental principles taught that where a statute was capable of two constructions, one of which would render it unconstitutional and the other valid, that which upheld its validity was to be adopted. The court concluded that the act permitted defendants to hold offices whether or not they were incompatible. The county counsel could ensure, through the assignment of tasks, that defendants would not be called upon to act in any matter in which the municipality was directly or indirectly affected.

The court found that even while upholding such an exemption as reasonable, other exemptions might be unreasonable or might be made so under such indefinite terms that they would destroy the validity of the fair trade schedule. Upholding the fair trade agreement with its stated exemption did not serve to advance the protection of the good will symbolized by the producer's brand or trademark, nor did it afford an appropriate measure of protection to the retailers and the public. The court affirmed, with direction that the default judgment be vacated.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a corporate taxpayer, challenged the deficiency tax assessments levied by respondent Division of Taxation under the Corporation Business Tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-1 et seq., for its two companies in successive calendar years. The issue was whether a merger of the two companies on the last day of a base year could be ignored in determining the tax upon the surviving corporation for the ensuing privilege year. The court held that the taxes imposed were not for the privilege of the year past but rather for the privilege to be exercised in the year to follow. Further, the tax calculated on the basis of net worth at the close of 1951 was for the franchise privilege for the year 1952 and the tax was measurable by the net worth. Respondent correctly held that appellant absorbed its two companies and hence its net worth for the purposes of the 1953 tax was the postmerger figure. These circumstances did not warrant a departure from the statutory scheme. Use of the average of asset values in the base year could not be denounced as unreasonable. The court affirmed the judgments.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent bank sought construction of the will of appellant beneficiary's mother under which respondent was the executor and trustee. The trial court declared that four accounts in which the deceased had named appellant as beneficiary had not vested ownership in appellant, but instead were to be administered as part of the decedent's estate. On appeal, the court noted that old law held that where a depositor retained control of the passbook and made withdrawals from the account, a valid inter vivos gift or trust did not exist. After reviewing legislation enacted after the accounts were established, however, the court held that the legislature clearly indicated its intent to create a substantive property right in the named beneficiary of a bank account in trust form, regardless that the transaction did not satisfy the Statute of Wills. The court held that the statutes applied retroactively to vest title in all of the accounts to appellant. The judgment of the lower court was reversed.</SPAN></P>

The trial court upheld the validity of the taxation structure except for two provisions in 1960 N.J. Laws c. 51 that were favorable to agricultural interests, one relating to real property and the other to personalty, both of which were held invalid. Plaintiff and defendants appealed, and the court certified the appeal before the appellate division could act. The court affirmed the judgment after modifying the finding of invalidity of the taxation of farm machinery and livestock. The court ruled that there was no constitutional prohibition against preferential treatment of personal property, and upheld its validity. N.J. Const. art.

Police broke in, arrested defendant, and confiscated the heroin, all without a search warrant. Affirming, the court held that the police had probable cause to believe an offense was being committed and it was committed in their presence because they saw it happening. The police officers' presence in a common passageway was not misconduct or invasion of anyone's rights and the search was not unreasonable where demand for admittance would likely have led to disposal of the heroin before police officers could enter.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff filed a complaint to recover for injuries caused by the deleterious substance. The trial court awarded plaintiff $ 135 special damages and $ 250 for pain and suffering on the theory of an implied warranty of fitness. Defendant sought review contending that the &quot;innkeeper&quot; rule, which stated that the serving of food constituted a service, not a sale of goods, was applicable. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court found that the &quot;innkeeper&quot; rule was not applicable in plaintiff's case. The court found that while it had been held that an innkeeper did not sell food, but merely satisfied the needs of a guest, the same could not be said for a cafeteria. Plaintiff bought and paid for his food, and then had the option of carrying it off wherever he wished. The element of service in a cafeteria was minimal, and food was quite obviously &quot;sold&quot; on defendant's premises.</SPAN></P>

Plaintiff refused to file tax returns under the Corporation Business Tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-1 et seq. Defendant issued a certificate tax lien. Plaintiff did not file a protest with defendant or seek a hearing before him, but instead filed a complaint in the trial court seeking a judgment directing defendant to certify that there were no liens on plaintiff's property for taxes due. The trial court granted defendant's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed as a matter of right from the judgment of the trial court (New Jersey), which convicted him of murder in the first degree and sentenced him to death. The trial court admitted confessions that defendant made to police while in custody, despite defendant's claims that he made the confessions involuntarily.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was taken into custody without a warrant and was held for several days and interrogated intermittently without being charged or taken before a magistrate as required by R.R. 3:2-3(a). Defendant claimed to have been deprived of sleep and given little food while held incommunicado, and alleged physical abuse and death threats. The trial judge examined the allegations of physical abuse and found the confession to be voluntary. On appeal, the court reversed and remanded and held that the trial judge had erred when he found the claims of procedural violations and misconduct to be mere technicalities. The court held that U.S. Const. amend. XIV gave defendant the right to fundamental fairness and that all attendant facts and circumstances should be examined to determine if the confession was voluntary. The court held that psychological pressure, and not just physical abuse, could overbear the will of defendant. The court held that while the failure to take defendant to a magistrate without delay did not make the confession per se involuntary, it did trigger careful scrutiny of the conditions under which the confession was made.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed defendant's conviction for first degree murder because the trial court applied the wrong standard to determine the admissibility of a confession when it focused on physical abuse and deemed improper arrest procedures and psychological pressures to be mere technicalities. The court remanded with instructions to determine voluntariness and fundamental fairness based on all relevant facts and circumstances.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff driver filed a petition for declaratory judgment in the Superior Court of New Jersey, pursuant to R.R. 4:88-10, to challenge the authority of defendant director of the Division of Motor Vehicles to revoke his license for failure to submit to reexamination. While the petition was pending in the Appellate Division, the court certified the cause on its own motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff driver refused to submit to a reexamination after an accident ordered by defendant director of the Division of Motor Vehicles under an informal policy based partly on age. Plaintiff refused to cooperate and defendant revoked his license. Plaintiff brought a declaratory judgment action and the court certified the pending case on its own motion. The court found that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 39:3-10, 39:3-11 vested comprehensive examination powers to ascertain physical fitness and driving ability in defendant director, and that he was empowered to create reasonable categories to administer a program of reexamination. The court held that a new regulation promulgated during the pendency of the case resolved plaintiff's challenge based on age. The court adopted the modern view that a license to operate an automobile was of vital significance and value to the licensee and could not be taken away except by due process, which required that the licensee be fairly informed as to the charge against him and be afforded fair opportunity to be heard thereon. The court reversed because defendant had not given plaintiff an opportunity for a pre-revocation hearing.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court dismissed the petition of plaintiff driver insofar as it attacked defendant director of the Division of Motor Vehicles' reexamination policies and regulation because defendant was empowered to establish reasonable categories for reexamination. The court reversed the order of revocation because due process required that plaintiff should have been given notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to reexamination and revocation.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner corporation owned 300 shares out of an issue of 1000 shares of the capital stock of another corporation. Respondent division of taxation declined to accord petitioner the status of an &quot;investment company&quot; under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-4(f), on the ground that petitioner did not meet the definition of an &quot;investment company&quot; by virtue of its ownership of more than 10 percent of the development corporation stock. Petitioner argued that the Corporation Business Tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:10A-1 et seq., violated the limitations placed on private, special, or local laws in N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7, and the equal protection clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV. According to petitioner the definition of an &quot;investment company&quot; was arbitrary and discriminatory in that it excluded any corporation, which otherwise would qualify for preferential tax treatment, whenever it owned more than 10 percent of the capital stock of any other corporation. The court ruled that the statute was not unconstitutional because it bore a reasonable relation to the government interest in preventing the evils of pyramiding and undue control of other corporations.

The court held that the classification of goods listed under &sect; 2A:171-5.8 as prohibited from Sunday sales was not plainly demonstrated to be capricious. The court held that the statute, which applied in one county but not to defendants' competitors in adjacent counties, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The statute was not unconstitutional for vagueness or lack of clarity, and the conduct of defendants being in clear violation of the express statutory language, none of them could attack the statute's constitutionality on the ground that it might be taken as having application to other situations not before the court.

The court determined that the law was valid, even though it did not provide an exemption for persons whose religious beliefs required them to observe Saturday or some other day of the week as their Sabbath.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowner brought suit against defendants, township and its officers, arguing that the zoning ordinance was invalid and seeking to have its property zoned for industrial use. The lower court dismissed plaintiff's complaint on the merits. On appeal, plaintiff' argued that the self-interest of certain members of the municipal planning board motivated the passage of the ordinance. The appellate court reversed the lower court's judgment, finding that ordinance was invalid due to the conflict of interest but that plaintiff's action lacked merit. Both parties cross-petitioned the court for certification. Defendant township then passed a new zoning ordinance without the participation of the self-interested parties. The court found the new zoning ordinance valid but reversed the judgment of the appellate court in invalidating the old ordinance in its entirety. The court held that only those parts of the old ordinance resulting from the self-interest of the two members of the municipal planning board were invalidated because Washington Township, N.J.., Zoning Ordinance &sect; 18, repealed, and the principle of separability required that the sections of the ordinance be separable.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:115-2. Defendants appealed the denial of their motions to dismiss the indictments, and on appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that &sect; 2A:115-2 was not unconstitutional for failure to contain a scienter requirement regarding the nature of the publications. Scienter was implied in &sect; 2A:115-2, and the statute would thereafter be construed as though it contained the word &quot;knowingly,&quot; because it referred to persons who acted with intent and it expressly confined its reference to those who did so &quot;without just cause,&quot; which indicated legislative consideration of intent. The &quot;without just cause&quot; language was not so vague that it violated due process; in light of its purpose and common understanding, the language embodied an exception that protected those who might possess and distribute obscene material in the course of bona fide scientific, medical or comparable research or study or in the course of law enforcement activities or in other like circumstances unrelated to the appeal to prurient interest.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the denial of defendants' motions to dismiss the obscenity possession and distribution charges, and held that the obscenity statute was constitutional because scienter was an implied element of the statute, and because the language limiting offenders to those who acted &quot;without just cause&quot; was not impermissibly vague, as it embodied an exception for those whose conduct was unrelated to the appeal to prurient interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was tried and convicted for possession of a small amount of marijuana, under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24:18-4. On review, the appellate division found that the legislature, by passing the N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2A:170-8, impliedly removed the offense for which the defendant was convicted from &sect; 24:18-4. That court remanded to a new trial, holding that the defendant was entitled to a jury instruction on the &sect; 2A:170-8. From that decision, both parties appealed. The court reversed the appellate division's holding, finding that the legislature did not intend to remove defendant's offense from N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24:18-4, thus plaintiff could have properly proceeded under either statute. Defendant's argument was considered moot by this determination, but the court did comment that even if his drugs were for personal use, the legislature included such in N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 24:18-4 as to deter that and harsher crimes such as trafficking.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the lower court's rulings, finding that a jury instruction on the crime of use was not necessary. For the crime of possession of drugs, the court found that either statute could apply and the decision of which to proceed under was properly left to plaintiff State of New Jersey. The court reinstated defendant's conviction and dismissed defendant's cross-appeal as being moot.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed his conviction by a Union County Court (New Jersey), for violating N.J. Stat.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was stopped by a policeman who cited him for violation of N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-97, for careless driving. He was convicted, and, on appeal, the trial court convicted him of violating N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:4-82, for failure to keep to the right. On appeal, defendant argued that &sect; 39:4-97 violated both U.S. Const. amend. XIV &sect; 1 and N.J. Const. art. 1 &sect; 1. He argued alternatively, that his conviction under &sect; 39:4-82 should have been reversed because the trial court erred in holding a trial de novo, and that he was placed twice in jeopardy for one offense. The court affirmed the convictions. The court held that the trial court had the right and the duty under R.R. 3:10-10(b) to correct a defect in the complaint. Section &sect; 39:4-97 met constitutional requirements. Because a judgment on a trial de novo nullified the judgment of the lower court, when defendant was convicted by the trial court there were one trial and one conviction arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle by him. He was not tried twice nor twice punished for the same offense. The court saw no merit to defendant's argument that the de novo trial violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</SPAN></P>

It also held that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in denying the motion where proffered evidence regarding the voluntariness of defendants' confessions was not newly discovered because defendants had been aware of it prior to trial. Finally, the court ruled that &sect; 2A:113-4, which gave the jury the discretion to recommend life imprisonment where it returned a verdict of first degree murder, was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

After damages were awarded, appellants sought review of the judgment contending that the option granted by the legislature to respondent of selecting one of two alternative procedures in condemning property deprived them of equal protection of the law where only one of those options provided for a trial by jury. In affirming the judgment, the court held that the due process clauses of the U.S. and New Jersey Constitutions did not prohibit the legislature from establishing different rules of procedure for different classes of cases provided that the variations related merely to matters of procedure and did not deprive any property owner of substantial equality in the adjudication of his rights.</SPAN></P>

Finally, the court held that if, as the evidence indicated and the juvenile court found, the injuries inflicted by appellants actually resulted in the victim's death, then his neglect in not taking care of himself would not constitute an intervening cause breaking the chain of causation in the legal sense nor would it impair the validity of the juvenile court's finding.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The Bergen County Board of Taxation (board), contested the trial court's order directing the county treasurer to refund to appellant village its 1959 apportioned county tax, finding the equalization table unconstitutional and void as applied to appellant. The trial court made its partial final judgment upon remand from several interlocutory orders in which the court had held that the suspension of tax collection was not the appropriate remedy for inequity in the equalization table because that remedy effectively would have denied the public vital services. Thus, the court reversed the trial court's judgment, vacated it in its entirety, and remanded for further proceedings, holding that the trial court clearly did not comply with the court's mandate. The court ruled that the 1959 equalization table and the apportionment of the county tax were reviewable only in the administrative process, and that as to any claimed inequity for 1959 which could not be addressed by administrative review, the appropriate course was for appellant to seek a credit in another year for the overcharge.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff citizens sought a declaration that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:10-1 was violative of N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; III, para. 1, and that the county was entitled to elect three members to the general assembly rather than the two allotted. The trial court dismissed the complaint on the ground that decision as to need for reapportionment was committed exclusively to the legislature. The court certified the matter and determined that because the legislature had failed to apportion the assembly at the first session after the 1950 census, the current apportionment was incorrect. The court held that it had jurisdiction to entertain the action, without infringing upon the power of the legislative branch, as the matter was within its constitutional authority and was one of its duties as well. However, the court held that because the 1960 census had already been taken and preliminary figures were available, it would be impractical to fashion any remedy based upon the 1950 numbers. Thus, the court presumed that the legislature would perform its constitutional duty to reapportion when the preliminary census results became available, and retained jurisdiction in case it did not.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court withheld a decision on the merits because plaintiff citizens' complaint was more practically addressed by the legislature's reapportionment with the 1960 census, which had already been taken, rather than fashioning a remedy based on the 1950 census. The court retained jurisdiction in the event that the legislature failed to perform its constitutional duty to reapportion in accordance with the latest census.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant city enacted an ordinance that prohibited the Sunday operation of most retail stores, including those of plaintiff business owners. Plaintiffs filed a complaint, and the trial court entered judgment for defendant. Plaintiffs contended that N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2A:171-1 et seq. foreclosed local legislation even though the ordinance fully conformed with its policy, on the ground that the imposition of penalties by one municipality and not by another denied equal protection of the law. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that the police power delegated to municipalities included authority to legislate on the subject, and that the statute affected municipal power only by way of limiting its exercise to ordinances which did not conflict with the state law. The circumstance that a municipality chose to exert its police power while neighboring municipalities remained inert was the inevitable consequence of home rule and did not result in a denial of equal protection of the law. The court held that although some activities were permitted by the ordinance while others were not, the classification of what was permitted and prohibited was not arbitrary.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that the complaint failed to set forth a claim for relief because plaintiff had no interest sufficient to support the action.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 12:7-47. Defendant argued that his conviction was void because the complaint was not verified by complaining witnesses and because the statute empowering the navigation magistrate was unconstitutional and therefore did not create a court that conferred subject matter jurisdiction. The court reversed defendant's conviction, holding that defendant had waived his objection to the faulty complaint by his appeal under N. J. Ct. R 3:10(6), but that he had not waived his objection to the navigation court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The court held that the magistrate was improperly appointed and was in fact an employee of the executive part of the state government who could not confer subject matter jurisdiction. The county court held jurisdiction only in the appellate capacity and should have set aside defendant's conviction.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:171-5.1 et seq.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At the election of 1959, most of the counties in New Jersey adopted amending language to the existing Sunday sales laws, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect;&sect; 2A:171-1 to 2A:171-12, which restricted the sales and services offered by merchants on Sundays. Plaintiff business owners challenged the constitutionality of this legislation, claiming that it violated the constitutionally provided guarantees of separation of church and state and equal protection. Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment before the lower court, and defendant State of New Jersey responded with a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The lower court granted defendant's motion, but denied plaintiffs' motion. On appeal, the court affirmed the denial of plaintiffs' motion because the court was to uphold a classification unless it was plainly demonstrated to be capricious and plaintiffs could not meet that standard for purposes of the motion. The lower court's granting of defendant's motion was in error though, because the standard of review for such a motion was to assume the validity of the adversarial position, therefore the arbitrariness of the classification and the challenge to equal protection were to go to a jury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the lower court's denial of summary judgment to plaintiff business owners because they did not overcome the constitutionality of the statute. However, the lower court did err in granting defendant State of New Jersey's motion for judgment on the pleadings, because such a motion assumed the validity of the adversary's pleadings, therefore the equal protection issue was properly brought to a jury.</SPAN></P>

Third-party defendant filed a fourth-party complaint against operators of the airplane under the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law, N.J. Stat. &sect; 2A:53A-1 et seq. Service of process was not made personally upon the fourth-party defendants, but rather pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6:5-3. The lower court entered summary judgment against defendant, granted third-party defendant's motion to dismiss, and granted fourth-party defendant's motion to dismiss. The court affirmed the grant of summary judgment and held that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 6:2-7 imposing absolute liability was constitutional. The court held that defendant's third party complaint should not have been dismissed because the &quot;wrongful act&quot; required by &sect; 2A:53A-3, included any action resulting in the imposition of absolute liability, and that the aircraft owner was not precluded from seeking to place the loss on the person responsible for it.</SPAN></P>

The trial court determined that the law was constitutional and the respondent had the proper jurisdiction, but it dismissed the complaints insofar as they related to the individual defendants for procedural considerations.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city complained that although the aggregates of real property by local assessors were equalized at full value by respondent county board of taxation under N.J.

Thus the municipality, which was more diligent than others in reaching taxable personalty, or used a higher percentage of true value, was penalized in its share of the cost of county government. Appellant challenged a decision by respondents, county board of taxation and New Jersey Division of Tax Appeals, which authorized the inclusion of the assessed value of personal property in the apportionment basis for the cost of county government among the municipalities under &sect;&sect; 54:3-17 to 19. Appellant wanted the aggregate assessments of personal property to be disregarded or the statute declared unconstitutional.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant borough appealed the judgment of a superior court (New Jersey) that struck down two ordinances regulating and licensing solicitors and canvassers as generally unlawful under state law or invalid as to plaintiff non-resident sales representative under the Commerce Clause, and the cause was certified prior to being heard in the appellate division.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff non-resident sales representative challenged two of defendant borough's ordinances, which required solicitors and canvassers to obtain a permit and license. The trial court found that the license fee, bond, and medical certificate provisions were invalid as unreasonable burdens on interstate commerce, and further struck down a provision delegating to the police chief the power to assess applicants' character as it failed to provide adequate guidelines. The court certified the cause on its own motion before it was heard in the appellate division. The license fee was excessive and invalid under state law, as well as violative of the Commerce Clause. The bond requirement was invalid under the Commerce Clause because it bore no relation to the amount of business done and discriminated against non-residents. The medical certificate requirement was unlawful because it was an invalid and arbitrary exercise of police power. Finally, the court upheld the delegation of power to the police chief because the ordinance provided adequate standards to guide his determination. Thus, the court affirmed, as modified to uphold the delegation of power to the police chief.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed, as modified, because the license fee, bond, and medical certificate provisions of defendant borough's ordinances constituted unreasonable burdens on interstate commerce, and were invalid as applied to plaintiff non-resident sales representative, in addition to being invalid under the police power. However, the standards controlling the exercise of the delegation to the chief of police were legally sufficient.</SPAN></P>

The use contemplated was not that different from those already permitted in the subject zone, such as churches, public schools, and public playgrounds. The court also held that defendant could have properly concluded that a special reason for the variance existed. The education of children directly furthered the general welfare.

The court held that the increased lot width and area of the ordinance were valid. Some sections of the ordinance were invalid because they unlawfully delegated power to the planning board that was beyond its authority. Nowhere in N.J. Stat.

The court reversed, holding that jurisdiction over a criminal offense was directly conferred by statute and not just by the consent of those involved. Although jurisdiction was not expressly given to the juvenile and domestic relations court, statutory interpretation of that court's authority to hear &quot;summary&quot; criminal matters granted it concurrent authority with the county court to hear criminal charges under &sect; 2A:100-2.</SPAN></P>

Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff's action was barred by the charitable immunity doctrine, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 16:1-48 et seq. Defendant's motion was denied because the lower court held that the statute was not retroactive and could not have been invoked to bar plaintiff's cause of action, which had fully accrued prior to the statute's passage. The court affirmed the denial of summary judgment. The court held that when it judicially construed a statute, its terms were not given retroactive operation unless they were so clear, strong, and imperative that no other meaning could have been annexed to them, or unless the intent of the legislature could not have otherwise been satisfied.

Several days after purchasing the trailer, plaintiff orally inquired of defendant township whether she might place a trailer on her lot and was informed that she could not. The lower court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff. The court reversed and held that plaintiff was not permitted to place the trailer her land. The court held that defendant's trailer ordinance prohibited the use of trailers for residential purposes and that the refusal of defendant to permit the isolated and interspersed maintenance of trailers in residence districts was not an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the zoning power, even where, the proposed location in its present state and the reasonably foreseeable future was rural. The court found that it was reasonable for defendant's officials to conclude that there did exist a long-range potential for development of the locality in which plaintiff's property was located and that such potential would be eliminated by permitting the use of a trailer as a permanent residence on an individual lot.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 48:12-152 barred even minors from recovering for injuries they sustained while they were illegally on a railroad. The court noted that the statute applied by terms to &quot;any person,&quot; including persons who &quot;played&quot; on the railroad. The court held that plaintiffs' contention that as a minor, plaintiff child could not be held contributory negligent, was irrelevant, because &sect; 48:12-152 absolved defendant from liability, and contributory negligence was not an issue. Section 48:12-152 comported with the common law when it was enacted; assuming it no longer did, it was not for the court to disregard its clear mandate, for it was the legislature's prerogative to state public policy. Plaintiffs' allegation that defendant had caused injury willfully and wantonly was unavailing, because there was no evidence in the record to support a finding that defendant knew plaintiff child was on the railroad prior to her injury.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment for defendant railroad. By statute, defendant was absolved from liability for any injury caused to any person, even a minor, who was upon the railroad illegally. As defendant was not liable, whether plaintiff child was contributory negligent was irrelevant. Because the evidence was uncontradicted that defendant did not know plaintiff child was on the tracks, defendant was not willfully and wantonly negligent.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayer appealed a judgment from a superior court (New Jersey) which dismissed his suit against defendant City of Brigantine alleging that the authority of the Municipal Finance Commission (commission) under &sect; 403 of the Municipal Finance Commission Act, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 52:27-4, had terminated, and that a private sale approved by the commission under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 52:27-29.1 was therefore void.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In a suit for equitable relief, plaintiff taxpayer attacked a private sale entered into by defendant City of Brigantine through the approval of its Municipal Finance Commission (commission) under N.J.

Plaintiff contended that the commission's authority had automatically terminated upon fulfillment of the conditions expressed in &sect; 403 of the Municipal Finance Commission Act, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 52:27-4. The trial court dismissed the complaint and entered judgment for defendant. On certified appeal, the court reversed and remanded. The court held that &sect; 52:27-4 did not call for self-executing termination of authority prior to a formal commission or court action. While noting that plaintiff's challenge under &sect; 52:27-4 should have been brought before the commission itself, in the interests of justice the court remanded the case to the trial court to enable plaintiff to join the commission as a party defendant and to proceed to establish that the conditions for termination had been satisfied.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Holding that defendant City of Newark's residency requirement for its employees was not unconstitutional, was not an unreasonable exercise of delegated power, and was not preempted by a legislative scheme of residency requirements or the jurisdiction of the New Jersey Civil Service Commission (Commission), the court reversed the judgment. Although N.J. Const. art. I, par. 1, established that persons were essentially free to do as they pleased, the conditioning of municipal employment on municipal residence did not restrain plaintiff employees' right to live where they pleased. The ordinance was rationally related to the interest of the municipality, and it was constitutional. The court could not second-guess the wisdom of the ordinance, but confirmed defendant's power to enact it. The existence of state statutes regulating the residence of state and municipal officers evidenced not preemption, but deference to the police power of defendant with respect to its employees. Similarly, the power of the New Jersey Civil Service Commission to ensure that terminations of municipal employees were for cause was not in derogation of defendant's power to define the cause.</SPAN></P>

Defendant was not estopped from enforcing the ordinance, as most plaintiffs were aware of its edict.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">After defendants asserted that under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:18A-5(a) the sums of all benefits returned by plaintiffs in annuity contracts to policyholders were not considerations returned within the meaning of the statute, but rather were cash surrender values and hence not deductible from the amount of gross considerations, plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment as to the meaning of the statutory provision permitting deduction of &quot;premiums or considerations (but excluding cash surrender values).&quot; Defendants appealed when lower court declared such were deductible. The court affirmed because the phrase &quot;cash surrender value&quot; was used in its technical sense as relating to life insurance policies and was not applicable to annuity contracts, thus, legislature did not intend to impose a tax, especially, where the usage of the term cash surrender value in annuities was explained. Furthermore, the distinction between annuities and life insurance provided a rational basis for differential treatment.</SPAN></P>

Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:56-1.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Intervenor non-profit acquired a tract of land in a blighted area, and obtained private financing for the erection of sanitary housing units there. Defendant City of Summit passed an ordinance calling for the opening of a street and installation of sanitary services that would benefit the development, and characterized this as a general improvement under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:56-1. In affirming the validity of the ordinance, the court held that &sect; 40:56-1 authorized defendant to treat the improvement as a general improvement to be funded by general taxation. N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:56-42 was not a limitation on defendant's power to proceed with any or all of the improvements listed in N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:56-1 as general improvements, and it did not except street improvements from this power. Similarly, &sect; 40:56-42 had no effect on sanitary improvements that were general improvements under &sect;40:56-1. This characterization also did not contravene N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; III, pars. 2, 3, as the improvements were primarily public in nature. The fact that they benefited intervenor's project was not conclusive of a private nature.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment for defendant City of Summit. The court held that the statutory scheme permitted defendant to treat the improvements contemplated by its ordinance as general, as opposed to local, improvements, and to fund them from general revenues. The fact that the improvements benefited intervenor non-profit's project, or even that this was the legislature's purpose, did not detract from the public nature of the improvements.</SPAN></P>

The court disagreed with appellant's contention that &sect; 54:4-3.20 was unconstitutional and stated that the statute was not in violation of the 1844 Constitution as amended. Appellant contended that the warehouse in question was not a warehouse within the intent and purpose of N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 54:4-3. The court noted that the objective of the statutory exemption was to place the public warehouses on an equal competitive footing with those of neighboring states where no personal property taxes were imposed. The court stated that whether the warehouse in question was a public or private warehouse would determine the applicability of the statutory exemption because only public warehouses were entitled to such an exemption.</SPAN></P>

The state sought to take defendant landowner's property and defendant refused to sell the land and contended that the state's right to acquire the land was not founded on a constitutionally sufficient statute. The trial court held in favor of the state and the appellate court restrained the changing of possession until after the appeal was completed. Defendant contended that &sect; 58:20-1 et seq., created a debt or liability without having submitted the question to the voters as required by N.J. Const. of 1947 art.

The trial court reasoned that defendant had not created a planning board pursuant to N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:55-1 et seq. and had no master plan for the development under N.J. Rev.

On appeal, the court reversed the judgment. It held that formulation of a master plan under the Municipal Planning Act, N.J. Stat.

On appeal, the court noted that it recently discarded the charitable immunity doctrine and was satisfied that the circumstances did not call for a departure from the prevailing rule that the overturning of a judicial decision is retrospective in nature. The court also noted that the complaint rested on the charge that respondent failed in its own responsibility to the plaintiff to exercise due care in the maintenance of its premises and that such a charge could be established by a showing that the premises were negligently permitted to remain in such condition as to cause the injury without any assertion or proof of negligence or legal responsibility on the part of the pastor.

The court affirmed and held that it was not disputed that the magistrate did not have authority to issue a warrant for a search beyond the territorial jurisdiction of his court. However, the court found that despite the illegality, the trooper who served as affiant for the warrant, honored the constitutional mandate that a magistrate's judgment intervene between the police and the search. Further, the court found that the trooper did not seek out the wrong magistrate in an effort to obtain warrants he knew the proper magistrates would have refused.

Plaintiff filed a request for an order directing payment of a consent judgment out of the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund (fund) pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 39:6-69, which was denied. Plaintiff appealed and argued that &sect; 39:6-69 violated the constitution because it contained an arbitrary and capricious classification that did not bear a substantial relation to the objective of the statute. The court affirmed and held that in accordance with the trial court's determination, plaintiff was prohibited from recovering for decedent's death because at the time of her death her vehicle was uninsured. The court held that the fact that the &sect; 39:6-69 classification only precluded recovery if the person injured was operating or riding in an uninsured motor vehicle owned by her, her spouse, parent, or child did not impair its constitutional validity.

Plaintiff brought a negligence action against defendant. The trial court entered summary judgment in favor of defendant, finding that defendant possessed an absolute immunity from any responsibility for its negligence. On appeal, the court held that the doctrine of immunity for charitable organizations was no longer supported by public policy. Due care was to be expected of all, and when an organization's negligent conduct injured another there was to be a basis for recovery without regard to whether the defendant was a private charity. The court held that stare decisis had no legitimate application to a doctrine built on a mistaken foundation persisting in the books after that foundation had been undermined, which was out of accord with modern general principles. Because the dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint was grounded on the defendant's alleged immunity, the court reversed with direction for a new trial.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent utility board ordered appellant railroad to reconstruct a bridge over its right-of-way at appellant's cost. Appellant argued that pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 48:12-67.1, it should only be responsible for 15 percent of the cost and that respondent utility board should pay the balance. Respondent utility board denied appellant's petition to modify the order, and the appellate division affirmed. On review, the court found that the legislature's intent was to eliminate existing grade crossings and that the state was willing to share those costs with the railroads. However, the court determined that the legislature did not intend to assume any part of the railroads' burden as to work where the crossing was not at grade and was already eliminated. Furthermore, the court determined that the legislative intent to confine the expenditure of state moneys to the removal of still existing grade crossings was not capricious or arbitrary. Finally, the court found that with respect to funding, money was only available for the elimination of existing grade crossings.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee village submitted an application to the county clerk of court seeking to incorporate and separate itself from appellant township. Appellant township objected to such application. After a special election was ordered by the county court and held pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:157-1 et seq., the majority of voters in appellee village approved the incorporation. Appellant challenged the election alleging that all of appellant's citizens should have been allowed to vote, not just appellee's citizens. Appellant also contended that the classification of municipality, township, and village found in &sect; 40:157-1 was unconstitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed the election decision. Section 40:157-2 specifically provided that only persons residing in the proposed village vote in the special election. The classifications, which were based upon population within a square mile area, were valid. Legislators created such classifications to increase the efficiency of the government in such areas. The population classifications bore a reasonable relation to the legislature's interests, so such classification scheme was constitutional.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant filed a writ of habeas corpus with the Superior Court (New Jersey), contending that that the Sex Offender Act (SOA), N.J. Stat. &sect; 2A:164-3 et seq., denied him the equal protection of the laws, and that a hearing must be held to determine if his transfer to state prison involved an abuse of discretion on the part of the commissioner.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of carnal abuse, open lewdness and attempting to impair the morals of a child under the age of 16 and sentenced to a mental hospital for treatment. Eventually, due to defendant's violent and unpredictable nature, he was transferred to prison. Over the ensuing years, defendant was repeatedly denied parole on the basis of his violent and uncooperative nature. After the fifth such denial, defendant filed for a writ of habeas corpus. Defendant contended that the Sex Offender Act (SOA), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:164-3 et seq., denied him the equal protection of the laws. The court disagreed, holding that the SOA had sufficient cause to classify repetitive sex offenders such as defendant as a separate group from general sex offenders. As to defendant's claim that he was entitled to a hearing on whether his transfer to state prison involved an abuse of discretion, the court held that the transfer was proper based on the particular circumstances of defendant's case. However, the court determined that defendant may have been improperly convicted as an adult and remanded the case for a determination of whether his conviction met the requirements of 1950 N.J. Laws 207, &sect; 3.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court held that defendant's violent nature was a sufficient justification for his transfer from a mental hospital to prison. The court ruled that the legislature acted within its authority when it limited the scope of the Sex Offender Act to repeat sex offenders such as defendant. However, sua sponte, the court remanded the case for a consideration of whether or not defendant was improperly convicted as an adult.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant township enacted an ordinance to encourage the observance of Sundays to preserve the public peace and promote the public health by assigning a day of rest.

Appellant offered no evidence in defense and the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents. Appellant challenged the decision, and the court certified the case for review. The court acknowledged that Sunday legislation was generally accepted in New Jersey.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent municipality enacted an ordinance that controlled rents. Respondent's ordinance went into effect simultaneously with the expiration of the State Rent Control Act of 1953. The general object of the ordinance was to continue the controls provided by the expiring state law. Petitioner property owners filed an action to enjoin the enforcement of the ordinance and for a judgment declaring the ordinance invalid and unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the ordinance and judgment was granted for respondents. On review, the court found that by permitting the Rent Control Act of 1953 to expire, the legislature indicated that rent control was at an end in New Jersey except in those municipalities that qualified under the terms of the subsequent special act, by taking appropriate conforming action. Because respondent did not take appropriate action by adopting a conforming ordinance, it had no power to legislate other than in the manner expressed in the special law. The trial court's decision was reversed and the ordinance was declared void and of no effect.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Trial court's ruling that found respondent municipality's rent control ordinance was valid was reversed and the ordinance was deemed void.

On appeal, the court held that no privilege was available to appellant as the subjects of the wiretaps were not appellant's clients or informants. The court held that the public policy of promoting the public interest in successful law enforcement would not be harmed by disclosure of the information. The court also held that N.J. Rev.

The jury returned a verdict in plaintiff's favor in the amount of $ 3000. The trial court, with the consent of defendant, increased the amount of damages to $ 7500. On appeal, the court reversed the trial court's judgment and remanded for a new trial on damages. The court held that the practice of additur did not violate the right to trial by jury, N.J.

The court held that the trial court erred when it concluded that plaintiff was not entitled to a great sum because plaintiff had a preexisting back injury. The court reviewed the evidence and found that plaintiff's prior back injury had cleared up and that the prior injury had no relation to the severe injuries plaintiff received from the accident at issue which included a ruptured disk that required surgery and caused plaintiff to be unable to work full-time until approximately a year after the accident.</SPAN></P>

Defendant forwarded to plaintiff a check for the aggregate principal payments then due to plaintiff under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43:16-1 et seq. Defendant refused compliance with plaintiff's demand for the payment of the first of the series of contributions to a consolidated fund and brought a proceeding in the trial court to have the act declared void, but the challenged provisions were sustained. The reviewing court entered judgment in favor of defendant because no demand for interest had been made prior to the payment. On further review, the court found that the interest claimed did not arise out of contract or a contractual status and the statute establishing the consolidated fund made no provision for the assessment of interest on delinquent payments as fixed by plaintiff, nor did it in specific terms authorize plaintiff to do so. Further, the court found that there was no agreement or common intention, when the principal was paid and accepted, to reserve the matter of interest for future determination. The court affirmed the reviewing court's decision.</SPAN></P>

The court refused to hold &sect; 2A:44-166&nbsp;unconstitutional and asserted that appellant's constitutional attack was wholly without merit. The court concluded that appellant knew or was bound to know that the transaction would be subject to applicable state law and that it voluntarily made the loan with the understanding that the machinery that secured the loan would be on leased premises. The court held that appellant took no steps to insure that it would receive monthly receipts to show that the rent on the leased property had been made and therefore could not complain of the accrual of the rental obligation and respondent's exercise of a statutory right to priority.</SPAN></P>

The lower appellate court upheld the validity of the provisions. Upon appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that pursuant to N.J. Rev.

The court noted that &sect; 34:11-47 did not specifically imbue respondent with the authority to designate the number of hours after which the overtime rates would take effect, but that the legislative grant to respondent to control overtime rates would be emasculated unless he was able make the designation. The court held that the delegation of power to respondent was constitutional where respondent's discretion was limited by whether its exercise reasonably tended to procure fair wages commensurate with the services rendered.</SPAN></P>

Specifically, appellant complained that the per capita student basis of apportioning caused appellant's property owners to pay a disproportionate share of the regional burden, thereby subsidizing the education of students from other municipalities comprising the regional school district. The court disagreed and held that apportionment on a per capita basis was permitted under N.J. Rev. Stat. 18:8-17.

The court found that the statutes applied to all automobile dealers within the state, without distinction. The court found that the statutes satisfied the initial inquiry as to equal protection. The court also held that the fact that the sale of motor vehicles was singled out was no ground for complaint if there was any reasonable basis for such action. The court held that the state had an absolute right to enter and force on all and every one regulations for the benefit of the public, and it was not for the court to say that doing so was contrary to the constitution.

The court affirmed the lower court's judgment and held that the classification in the ordinance was not inherently arbitrary or unreal, unconcerned with a legitimate public purpose within the cognizance of the police power. There were obvious reasons of substance for the differentiation and there was adequate ground for the differentiation made on the basis of the family relation and identification with the ownership by the familial tie. When the manifest purpose of the legislation was taken into account, the classification was not wholly irrelevant and so arbitrary and capricious. It had long been a matter of judicial notice that the liquor traffic had problems of its own peculiarly related to the public health, safety, and morals, so much so as it called for rigid control in the essential public interest.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In reviewing appellant corporation's liability for contributions to the State Disability Insurance Fund as affirmed by respondent Commissioner of Labor and Industry, the court considered whether the claim was barred by a statute of limitations. The court found that appellant's contributions were not paid because of an honest, though mistaken, belief that they were not owed, and respondent made no claim for more than four years. N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43:21-14(b), under which appellant's obligation was due, originally had no limitation, but the statute was amended during the time when appellant was unaware of the obligation, and respondent had over a year and a half to make its assessment within the four-year period. The court held that the limitation evidenced the legislative view that it would be contrary to the public interest and unfairly burdensome to employers to continue subjecting them indefinitely to old contribution claims, so the limitation period began when the contributions were due. The court concluded that the claim against appellant was legally barred by limitations, and the court reversed the decision and directed respondent to set aside the assessment.</SPAN></P>

Appellants contended that the Act's prohibition of the collection of union funds by persons convicted of high misdemeanors and other crimes was unconstitutional and violated a number of constitutionally secured individual rights, including due process and equal protection rights. The court affirmed, holding that none of appellants' constitutional arguments had merit because the Act was a reasonable exercise of the police power of both New Jersey and New York states.

Petitioner city assessed property taxes against respondent for the military's use of the terminal during the war, and the trial court set aside the assessment.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer challenged the judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Atlantic County in favor of respondents, city and purchaser, in his action to have respondents' contract for the sale of land declared void because he contended that N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent city, under the control and supervision of the municipal finance commission pursuant to N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:27-1 et seq., entered into a contract to sell certain land to respondent purchaser. Appellant taxpayer filed this action and contended that N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:27-29.1, which authorized the contract, was an unconstitutional delegation of power by the legislature to the commission because there was no norm, standard, or condition pursuant to which the commission could grant or withhold its express consent in writing and that the contract was void. The trial court entered judgment in favor of respondents and this appeal followed. The court affirmed because there was no substantial basis for the claim that uncontrolled power had been granted to the commission. Section 29.1 formed one section of an extensive act, the purpose, powers and objectives of which, expressed by its broad and comprehensive terms, were to restore where possible, financial stability to insolvent municipalities without interrupting to any great extent the everyday existence of the unit of local government.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff taxpayers sued defendant township for discrimination in tax assessments at true value. Plaintiffs sought use of the same level and standard of value used in assessing other types of property in the taxing district. Defendant sought dismissal on two grounds: failure to allege a basis for relief and lack of authority to grant the requested remedy. The division of tax appeals dismissed so much of the petitions based on the prayer for relief seeking a reduction below true value. On appeal, the court reversed the administrative determination and remanded because a state agency could grant relief to a taxpayer with a discrimination claim, and the dominant principle was equality of treatment and burden. The statutory scheme reflected the rule of equality as a predominant factor, and plaintiffs did not have to exhaust administrative remedies in seeking correction of the wrongful discrimination.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court set aside the order of the Department of Civil Service. The court held that the department misapprehended its function in admitting persons to its examination and in certifying lists thereafter.

The court noted that contrary to defendant's assertions, the United States Supreme Court's interpretation of the Federal Probation Act, 18 U.S.C.S. &sect;&sect; 724-728, had no effect on the its own interpretation of state law. The court also held that R.R. 3:7-13, which prevented a judge from making a change in sentence more than 60 days after the sentence was issued, was not in conflict with &sect; 2A:168-4, because the sentencing judge was not changing a sentence but reimposing one.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect; 2:103-3.1 a person under the age of 16 was incapable of committing a crime and could only be charged with juvenile delinquency. The court therefore found that appellant was not guilty of murder but only of juvenile delinquency.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff city appealed an order of the Superior Court of New Jersey, which entered judgment in favor of defendant state pension fund commission and denied plaintiff's motion requesting a declaratory judgment that N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 43:16-1(1952) et seq. resulted from legislative efforts to establish a solvent pension and retirement system for policemen and firemen. The statute placed all local funds under the control of defendant state pension fund commission, which would set the amount of municipal and state contributions. Plaintiff city sought a declaratory judgment that &sect;&sect; 43:16-5(b)(2), (b)(3), (c) were unconstitutional. The trial court upheld the constitutionality, and the court certified plaintiff's pending appeal. The court affirmed, holding that the statute was not an illegal delegation of taxing authority to defendant because defendant did not have the power to levy taxes. The court found that plaintiff and other involved municipalities must levy the taxes or otherwise raise the required amount, which was determined by defendant. The court also found that the classification of firemen and policemen's pension funds was made in the statute's predecessor, which was upheld against the charge that it was an unconstitutional classification resulting in an invalid special law. The court found that the statute included all the funds established under the preceding act and excluded none.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 51:1-96 and N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 51:1-29 and concluded that &sect; 51:1-96 was intended to deal with the apparatus used to measure bulk food sales while &sect; 51:1-29 applied to the sale of packaged foods. The court held that &sect; 51:1-29 required plaintiff weights and measures superintendent to promulgate regulations to deal with minor variations in packaging before the statute could be enforced. The court found that the delegation of such regulatory authority with general standards was a valid and constitutional exercise of the legislature's authority, particularly when it was intended to promote ongoing uniformity between federal and state regulations in a complex field.

Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:42-14 et seq.. Prior to a hearing in the Superior Court, the court certified the matter on its own motion for disposition by the court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner landlords owned complexes that were subject to federal rent regulations and respondent state rent control director promulgated regulations, known as Change No. 5 and Change No. 7, that prevented them from charging rents permitted by the Federal Housing Commissioner, while similar properties in clusters of less than 50 units were exempt from state control. On consideration of the petition for declaratory judgment, the court held that the State Rent Control Act of 1953 (the Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:42-14 et seq., was not an unconstitutional interference with contractual rights, but rather was a valid exercise of police power. The court also held that the regulations did not interfere with contractual provisions relating to federal rent control. The court also held that the Act did not exempt housing regulated by the federal housing commissioner. The court held, however, that while &sect;9 of the Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:42-22, allowed respondent to create classifications based on the use or character of properties, these regulations were based on quantity and were invalid and ineffective because they had no rational relationship to the state enabling legislation.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court found that the regulations were invalid because they applied on an arbitrary basis of the number of apartments in a rental housing enterprise, which was not authorized by the enabling legislation and had no rational relationship to the state law.

The issue involved whether exercise of state rent control by respondent over housing accommodations subject to maximum rent regulations was in conflict with federal law and therefore unconstitutional. The court found that there existed in the provisions of the National Housing Act an obvious intent by Congress to achieve reasonable rent stabilization to provide both moderate rentals and reasonable financial return to the investor. Petitioner was not in the category covered by the state control provision of the National Housing Act. The court found that the state rent control and other valid rent controls thereunder applied to petitioner's property had no element incapacitating the corporation from discharging its duties to the federal government.

Appellants filed a notice of appeal to the Appellate Division. The court noted that it would not substitute its independent judgment for that of respondent commissioners, but confined its inquiry to the ascertainment of whether the evidence before respondent commissioners furnished a reasonable basis for its action. The court affirmed the approval of the additional buses, noting that the record supported that the area needed more buses and that appellants failed to show that additional substantial competition would result from the application. Also, the court held that the operation of the buses on the proposed route was necessary and proper for public convenience and public interest. The court found that appellants' contention that they acquired a property right in their existing routes that would negate the type of decision made by respondent commissioners was without merit.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">A debtor made a chattel mortgage on his used automobile to plaintiff creditor as security for the payment of a loan. The debtor then defaulted on the loan and sold the car to defendant subsequent purchasers, conveying the certificate of ownership to them. Plaintiff filed an action against defendants that sought to recover possession of the car, or a judgment for its value, under the chattel mortgage. Defendants appealed the lower court's award of summary judgment to plaintiff, and the court reversed. The court held that under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 39:10-11, plaintiff was required to present the chattel mortgage with the certificate of ownership to the Director of Motor Vehicles to record the encumbrance thereon, and it failed to do so. The court ruled that &sect; 39:10-11 was a legitimate exercise of the state's police power, and was not an unconstitutional deprivation of plaintiff's property without due process of law. The court found that plaintiff failed to prove the statute unreasonable, and its rights would have been completely protected had it complied with the statute. Therefore, the court reversed the award of summary judgment for plaintiff.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the summary judgment for plaintiff creditor. The court held that the applicable statute was constitutional, and would have protected plaintiff's rights as the first chattel mortgagee if it had complied with its provisions and presented the mortgage with the ownership certificate to the Director of Motor Vehicles.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff landowners filed an action against defendants, county board of taxation and city, seeking relief from alleged discrimination in the assessments for taxation upon their property.

The court found that defendants' tax assessment method resulted in varying standards and consequent discrimination as between properties of like kind and character in the immediate vicinity, on the same and the opposite side of streets bounding the area of action. The court found that assessments made according to a uniform rate or measure were altered by defendant county board to work a denial of the individual equality secured by the organic law, and the remedy lied in striking down the discriminatory action.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c4">PRIOR HISTORY: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***1]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court, Chancery Division, entered on order of Judge Drewen who delivered the following oral opinion.  &quot;The court fundamentally is asked to declare unconstitutional an act of Congress known as the Communist Control Act of 1954.  The court declines to do so. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Chiefly, what is argued as a reason for the court's doing so is that the federal enactment is without implementation and that the county clerk, who is the defendant or respondent in these proceedings, is setting up his own machinery and his own personal functioning for the carrying out of a law which is, as contended, without lawful sanction.  It is the court's view that any argument which assumes the inadequate implementation of the federal statute is academic in the present situation.  Valid and sufficient implementation is provided in our election law.  Counsel for plaintiff admits he is here by due process. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The reasons proposed as competent to move the court to find that the federal act is unconstitutional are without relation to the concrete problem before us.  They are all based on the assumption that the federal statute or the conduct of the county clerk, or both, are directed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***2]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  to the plaintiff as an individual and that they deprive him of constitutional rights like that of free speech and the others cited by counsel.  I think a misconception prevails here.  Indeed, the plaintiff argues in his brief and argues here orally through his counsel that the federal statute has to do with the Communist Party as such and not with the plaintiff nor with any person individually.  With that proposition the court is in agreement.  And as for the conduct of the county clerk, he is dealing with the plaintiff in the manner that he does only in order that he may deal with the Communist Party as such.  It is not the county clerk's fault.  It is the plaintiff's fault who insists upon identifying himself with the party and becoming its embodiment, so to speak, in the choice of a campaign slogan as candidate for the office he seeks. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;It is all very well to argue that he may change his mind about one thing or another.  But the fact of the matter is that he proclaims himself the candidate of the Communist Party, and proclaims to the electorate that a vote for him is a vote for the party enthronement.  It seems to me that what we are really dealing with here is the choice of a&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***3]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  slogan.  We have a right to take the plaintiff at his word.  On the other hand, if he proposed a slogan like 'Against Anti-Communist Legislation,' it would, in all probability, have to be acceptable.  This, needless to say, is by way of </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c10">obiter dictum</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;I want to make a reference to particular passages in plaintiff's brief, these having been also repeated in the course of counsel's oral argument this morning.  They have to do with the duty of the county clerk to arrange for the placing of names of candidates of the parties entitled to participate in the election.  They have also to do with the claim that the federal legislature is amending the qualifications for local public office.  I see no such factor in the problem.  However, if the larger objective requires in individual instances, like the one before us, that there be a pertinent restriction upon access to public office, then such restrictions must be supported.  And if, in order to make good the outlawry of the Communist Party as such, it becomes unavoidable that individuals be prevented from carrying its banner, so to speak, well, that course will have to be taken in the administration of the law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;The court is impressed&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c4">[***4]</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">  with the idea that this peculiar method, as chosen by the plaintiff, is a keen way of circumventing the statute, because if it were valid for him to take the course that he has chosen, it would be valid for a complete set of candidates to do the same thing, the consequence of which, of course, would be to frustrate completely the design of the federal law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Counsel for the plaintiff speaks of the plaintiff's being prohibited or hampered 'in offering his program.' If this plaintiff has a program, something that is within the law (and I don't refer only to the federal law that we are dealing with), nobody denies to him the right of expounding his program to the people, even a program critical of the present law. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c11"><SPAN CLASS="c2">&quot;Now, necessarily I have to decide this promptly.  Circumstances deny to the court the opportunity of writing out its views at length.  I do, for the reasons stated, decide that the order to show cause under the complaint filed herein must be dismissed.&quot; </SPAN></P>

The court held that the only constitutional construction of &sect; 27:23-12, would limit its application to property acquired for turnpike purposes and, having been so acquired, used for such purposes, or held with the present design to devote it to such use within a reasonable length of time.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 2A:85-4 and N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2A:4-14. On appeal, the court noted that New Jersey statutes directed that children under 16 who committed any offenses which would be criminal if committed by adults were under the exclusive jurisdiction of the juvenile courts. The legal issue before the court was whether this clear statutory mandate could be judicially disregarded to enable the defendant to be tried for first degree murder in the county court. The court ruled that statutory enactments could not properly be nullified in whole or in part simply for policy reasons.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court set aside the order entered below and remanded the case to the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Union County. The court ruled that the New Jersey statutes lawfully vested exclusive jurisdiction in the juvenile court over misconduct by children under 16, including misconduct which would constitute murder or another heinous crime if committed by an adult.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant challenged the ruling of the trial court which convicted him as a habitual criminal. One issue before the court was whether the trial court erred in permitting appellant to introduce evidence of the date of his birth in order to attack the 1941 forgery conviction. The court was of the opinion that error was not committed in this respect. An order or proceeding in excess of jurisdiction was null and was subject to collateral attack. If appellant was under the age of 16 at the time of the commission of the offense of forgery in April 1941, the Union County Court of Special Sessions lacked jurisdiction to try him. Therefore, the judgment of conviction as a habitual criminal and the sentence imposed on appellant were vacated. The cause was remanded to the trial court for the purpose of imposition of sentence in connection with appellant's October 9, 1952 conviction.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant husband appeared in trial court in response to an order to show cause why a support order should not have been granted upon respondent wife's sworn complaint that he willfully refused and neglected to support her. The parties arrived at a settlement during the course of the hearing. They endorsed their consents to the order under attack and appellant agreed to financially support respondent. Appellant argued that the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court Law limited the jurisdiction of the juvenile and domestic relations courts to hear adult offenses of which desertion was one ingredient. Upon the entry of a permanent order with appellant's consent, the function of the criminal charge to bring coercive pressure upon appellant had been largely served. However, the criminal charge was not dismissed. Appellant's action in declining to proceed to final hearing and in consenting that the temporary support order be treated as a permanent order constituted consent before the trial court to the entry of a permanent order for future support.</SPAN></P>

The court also verified director's authority to divide the state into five marketing areas and set different prices because conditions varied among them.

The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, finding that defendant distributor could have been compelled by an injunction issuing out of a state court to abide by resale price maintenance provisions established in contracts between the manufacturer having interstate business activity and other retailers.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant wife challenged the dismissal of her counterclaim for separate maintenance by the chancery court upon a motion by plaintiff husband in plaintiff's suit for divorce. Defendant had previously filed a complaint against plaintiff for support in the juvenile and domestic relations court. The chancery court found that defendant's counterclaim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata because the same matters contained in the counterclaim had already been adjudicated against defendant in the juvenile and domestic relations court. Defendant sought review and the appeal was certified to this court on its own motion. This court reversed the dismissal, holding that plaintiff failed to meet his burden to show that the two claims were the same. Defendant's counterclaim was based on a charge of constructive desertion under N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2A:4-18(f). Nothing in the record of the juvenile and domestic relations court, however, indicated that defendant had claimed a violation of &sect; 18(f).

An order was entered appointing the investigator and ordering appellant to produce its financial records. Appellant sought review and the court certified the appeal on its own motion. The court found that the trial court had jurisdiction because respondents had reason to believe that there were unlawful expenditures of public funds, that the quantum of proof required for an application for investigation was such as would support the exercise of judicial discretion, and that appellant's cross claim requesting an extensive investigation estopped appellant from denying respondents a summary investigation. The court found that that no further findings of fact were required by statute, that further preliminary hearings could result in defensive dilatory tactics, and that appellant had not been prejudiced.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant pipeline company, acting under R.R. 20:1-1 et seq. and R.R. 48:10-1, presented a petition to a judge sitting as a legislative agent for the appointment of commissioners in the condemnation for a pipeline through the lands of plaintiff landowner. An order appointing condemnation commissioners was entered, to which plaintiff did not object. Subsequently, the commissioners filed a report of their appraisal of plaintiff's land and the damages to be paid by defendant. Plaintiff appealed this determination, and then moved to dismiss the petition for the appointment of commissioners, arguing that R.R. 48:10-1 was unconstitutional. The court dismissed, and the lower appellate court affirmed. Plaintiff sought review, and the court affirmed, holding that under R.R. 4:88-15(b)(7), proceedings to review an order of a judicial officer acting as a legislative agent were required to commenced within 45 days of the entry of such order, and plaintiff's motion was filed more than 10 months after the order appointing commissioners.

The court affirmed the order of the trial court that denied defendant's motion to dismiss. The court found that justices of the peace had jurisdiction at common law to punish simple assaults and simple assaults and batteries summarily, without indictment and without trial by jury. The court held that the summary jurisdiction of a justice of the peace or of a municipal magistrate in proceedings under the Disorderly Persons Act had expanded in the exercise of police power of the state beyond the original act to a variety of related petty offenses. The court ruled that the fact that the same act could have been an indictable offense was not controlling.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff resident appealed a judgment from the Superior Court of New Jersey, which found that no constitutional infirmity existed in the State Building Authority Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 52:18A-50 et seq., and that the proceedings taken thereunder by defendants, state officials and state building authority, were valid and effectual, and accordingly entered judgment for defendants on both counts of plaintiff's complaint.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, plaintiff resident contended that the challenged leases purported to create a state debt or liability in excess of the constitutional debt limitation and required appropriations of state money in disregard of the constitutional restrictions upon such appropriations in N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2. The court found that leases contained no pretense of conformance with the debt limitation provision, noting that defendants, state officials and state building authority, failed to submit the project to the electorate under N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2(3). The court then noted that the agreements contained &quot;the attributes of purchase,&quot; which thus subjected the agreements to the constitutional objection embodied in the debt limitation provision. The court thus found that the written agreements were not leases, but rather installment purchase contracts under the guise of leases, entered into in order to circumvent the basic limitation provision. The court accordingly declared the resolutions, leases, contracts, and proceedings below to be null and void, reversed the lower court's judgment, and vacated the finding that the lease was constitutional and valid.</SPAN></P>

Ann. &sect; 40:69A-1 et seq., was constitutional and dismissed plaintiffs' action that had sought to challenge the validity of the statute and to prevent the scheduled election with respect to the adoption of a proposed charter plan for the municipal government in question.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On review, the court rejected plaintiff taxpayers' contention that the Faulkner Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 40:69A-1 et seq., was unconstitutional, finding that there had been no improper delegation of legislative power in violation of N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 1(1). The court then found that the Act's optional plans did not violate N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7(9) as they were available to all municipalities in general, noting that the fact that the voters of all municipalities failed to adopt the same plan did not mean that a special or local law had been enacted in each case. The court further found no violation of N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7(4) in the Act's title where the title gave notice to the legislature and the public of the general purposes of the Act. The court also found no constitutional infirmity in the &quot;freeze period&quot; of the Act, noting that plaintiffs failed to convince the court that the population distinction was arbitrary and without reasonable basis. The court affirmed, concluding that the non-repealer provisions of the Act were valid, as they in no way concerned rights created or duties and burdens imposed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the determination that the Faulkner Act (Act) was constitutional as well as the dismissal of plaintiff taxpayers' action, holding that the provision of charter commissions concerning the choice of municipal governments was not an improper delegation of legislative power. The Act was not a special and local law, but rather a general law available to all municipalities, regardless of whether all voters selected the same plan.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant company challenged the order of the Chancery Division of the New Jersey Superior Court that denied its motion for an award of attorney fees in plaintiff state's action to recover personal property in defendant's possession that had escheated to plaintiff.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff state brought suit against defendant company alleging defendant's possession of personal property that had escheated to plaintiff. Third parties claiming title were thereafter added as party defendants. After the trial court denied the third parties' claim, it declared that the property had escheated to plaintiff and directed defendant to transfer the property to the state treasurer and directed the treasurer to pay out of the escheated property a counsel fee to the attorney who prosecuted the action for plaintiff. Defendant moved for the allowance of counsel fees and appealed the trial court's order denying its request. In reversing, the court concluded that trial court misinterpreted N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 2:53-23 and abused its discretion in denying any allowance of counsel fees to defendant. A complaint under the Escheat Act regarding personal property was an extraordinary proceeding requiring defendant to perform a duty that would otherwise fall upon plaintiff of furnishing all information to support the claim, thus placing the burden on defendant, who had committed no wrongdoing. In such circumstance, it was equitable to award counsel fees.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The order of the trial court denying defendant company's motion for the award of counsel fees in plaintiff state's action to recover personal property that had escheated to it was reversed, as the trial court abused its discretion in denying such an award where defendant was required, through no wrongdoing on its part, to perform the duty of establishing the validity of plaintiff's complaint. An award of counsel fees was therefore equitable.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, and certification to the court, the court affirmed, holding that although appellant acquired contractual rights under the charter which formed respondents' railroad, it was not an impairment of the obligations of a contract in violation of U.S. Cons. art. I &sect; 10 for the legislature to authorize the taking of appellant's stock by eminent domain. The court held that all contracts are subject to the right of eminent domain.

Plaintiff area residents instituted suit seeking to preclude the sale, arguing that the intended use violated the municipal zoning ordinance. Intervenor city was permitted to join and filed a cross-claim seeking to enjoin defendant school from using the property for its intended purpose. The trial court concluded that the municipal zoning ordinance constituted an unlawful discrimination between public and private schools and entered a judgment against the plaintiffs and intervenor. Intervenor appealed the dismissal of its cross-claim. In reversing, the court concluded that post-secondary schools were distinct from public and private grammar and high school, were reasonably placed in a separate classification, and could reasonably be excluded from a residential district. Defendant school failed to overcome the presumption of reasonableness, and the matter was remanded for a determination of the scope of restraints that could be imposed upon the property.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Cross-petitioners, beneficiaries of various trust funds, challenged a declaratory judgment from a trial court that affirmed the constitutionality and general application of the so-called Prudent Man Investment Statute, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 3A:15-18 et seq., and its application to four specific trusts created prior to its passage. The statute expanded the types of investments that a fiduciary in the state could legally make. On the petition of respondent trust company and the cross-petitions of beneficiaries under three of the trusts, the appellate court granted certification to review the judgment of the lower court. The appellate court held that the statute was not rendered unconstitutional by virtue of the retrospective provision because where the intention of the creator of the trust was carried out quite obviously there was no interference with the vested rights of the beneficiaries. In considering the statute as applied to the specific trusts, however, the appellate court reversed the judgment of the lower court insofar as it applied the statute to two of the trusts because the lower court misinterpreted the language of the testators.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an appeal certified by the court on its own motion while the case was pending in the Appellate Division of the Superior Court (New Jersey), appellant landowner challenged the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance of appellee township that divided the township into three zones. Appellant contended for the first time on appeal that a five-acre requirement for building in a residential zone was unreasonable per se.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant landowner challenged a summary judgment order upholding the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance of appellee township that divided the township into three zones: an &quot;A&quot; zone requiring a half acre building lot; a &quot;B&quot; zone required a five-acre lot; and a business zone. Appellant's mother owned about 24 acres, half of which was in the &quot;A&quot; zone and half in the &quot;B&quot; zone. Three years after adoption of the ordinance, appellant's mother conveyed to him less than an acre of land located in the five-acre zone. Appellant then challenged the ordinance. Appellee was granted summary judgment on the grounds that the challenged parts of the ordinance were valid. On appeal, appellant for the first time challenged the five-acre requirement. Since the issue involved important questions of public policy, the appellate court granted certiorari in the public interest. The appellate court affirmed the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance as amply justified to preserve the character of the community. The appellate court held that appellant failed to show how the allowance of an exception could be commanded without ultimately sounding the death knell of the whole zoning movement.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">On appellant's challenge of the five-acre building-lot requirement, the constitutionality of the zoning ordinance of appellee township was upheld. The court held that a zoning ordinance that was reasonably designed, by whatever means, to further the advancement of a community as a social, economic, and political unit, was in the general welfare and therefore was a proper exercise of the zoning power.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In plaintiff advertising company's action for declaratory judgment, defendant municipality appealed from the judgment of a New Jersey Superior Court, finding defendant's zoning ordinance to be invalid and void. The court certified the case for appeal on its own motion.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant municipality amended its zoning ordinance so that it prohibited any sign which directed attention to a business or service sold or offered elsewhere than upon the premises, and another provision which required the removal of nonconforming signs within two years from the effective date of the ordinance unless continued use of individual signs was authorized by the board of adjustment. Plaintiff advertising company filed an action seeking to have both provisions declared invalid. The trial court granted plaintiff summary judgment, finding that the most recent amendment to the Billboard Act of 1942 (the Act) abolished the right of a municipality to legislate on the subject of billboards. On defendant's appeal, the court found that the language omitted from the Act was precautionary surplusage and thus the omission did not support the finding that municipalities could no longer regulate billboards. However, the section of defendant's ordinance that required removal of or approval for nonconforming signs was invalid because it contradicted N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:55-48. Accordingly, the court reversed the holding of the trial court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the judgment of the trial court that found defendant's zoning ordinance to be invalid and void. The court ordered that the trial court enter a new judgment consistent with the opinion. The court held that the only invalid portion of the zoning ordinance was the portion that limited the statutory right of the property owner to indefinitely continue a nonconforming use.</SPAN></P>

The court reversed and held that &sect; 40:55-39(d) was not unconstitutional because it did not give the board uncontrolled power. However, the court held that the only special reason that the board found for granting the variance was the proximity of other commercial buildings to defendant's land. The court held that this reason, standing alone, was insufficient to support the granting of the variance.

Furthermore, the evidence showed that such an ordinance was not only desirable but also necessary for the protection of property and the preservation of the public health and welfare of the municipality. Finally, the court found that defendant did not exceed its authority in enacting the ordinance because it was reasonably designed to deal with the problem at hand.

The court held that this was not precluded, despite the rejection of a similar argument in an earlier prosecution. Res judicata did not apply to defenses raised in a criminal prosecution of fresh violations, and stare decisis did not apply because defendant had abandoned this specific challenge the prior proceeding. The court held that that state's constitutions, beginning with the original in 1776, merely continued, and did not extend, the right to a jury trial as it existed at common law. The court found that the conduct prohibited by the ordinance would not be considered a public nuisance, there was no right to a jury trial under the common law, and accordingly, none under the state constitution.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant appealed the denial of his writ for habeas corpus by the Superior Court of New Jersey, that found N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2:135-3 (1940) unconstitutional. Defendant alleged that his payment of a fine of $ 1,000 under the statute for bookmaking had precluded his incarceration for two to five years under the language of the amended statute. Defendant had originally been sentenced under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2:135-3 (1937).</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted for bookmaking and sentenced under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2:135-3 (1937) to a fine of $ 1,000 and imprisonment from two to five years. In 1951, defendant filed a writ of habeas corpus challenging his sentence, contending that the new statute, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2:135-3 (1940), had changed the sentence from &quot;fine and imprisonment&quot; to &quot;fine or imprisonment&quot; and that under a new constitutional amendment that placed no limit on the legislature's power to change penalties, he was entitled to be released. The trial court denied his writ on the basis that the 1940 statute was unconstitutional and defendant sought review. The court affirmed and held that a comparison of the two statutes had made it clear that the latter had violated the former and was not constitutionally permitted at the time under N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; VII, para. 2. The court found that a statute that was invalid at the time it was passed could not later become valid with a constitutional amendment that had granted the legislature greater power to amend sentencing laws.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed denial of defendant writ for habeas corpus by the trial court had held that the 1940 statute which had changed the sentence to a fine or imprisonment had unconstitutionally diminished the penalty of the earlier statute providing for both a fine and imprisonment that was in effect when the defendant was sentenced. The court found no merit in the argument that a 1947 constitutional amendment had made such a change possible.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant city challenged the judgment of the appellate court that affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of respondent property owners and set aside a zoning ordinance as it applied to respondents' property, and asserted that appellant had the power to zone in relation to different divisions of districts on either side of the street. The court affirmed and found that the New Jersey Constitution gave appellant the right to adopt zoning ordinances pursuant to the general laws. The court noted that the requirement of a comprehensive plan was intended to avoid an arbitrary, unreasonable, and capricious exercise of zoning power. The court opined that the touchstone of reasonableness was the relation of the ordinance to the health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the community. The court found that one side of a narrow strip of land was zoned residential and the other side was primarily business, and adopted the view that such a zoning plan was destructive of the residential values as to have been confiscatory. The court held that appellant's zoning ordinance was not per se illegal, but the ordinance had to conform to the purposes enumerated in the comprehensive plan.</SPAN></P>

Appellant challenged both the rezoning of its land and respondent's refusal to grant a variance despite a favorable recommendation from the local board of adjustment. The court affirmed the judgment of the trial court in favor of respondent. The court held that the rezoning was accomplished in a manner consistent with N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:55-9, and entirely consistent with the growth of residential use and the abandonment of industrial use in the district. The court found that respondent's refusal to grant appellant a variance was not an abuse of discretion in light of the proof of the changed character of the district which prompted rezoning in the first place.</SPAN></P>

On appeal, the court construed the ordinance to cover the kind of vaporous emanations that had come from defendant's stack. It also determined that defendant's contention that the judgment was against the weight of the evidence was without support. Defendant contended that in order to support its conviction, plaintiff township was required to prove that the emanations constituted a common law nuisance. The court ruled that, as an action of the township's legislative body, the ordinance was not subject to judicial superintendence unless it was clearly beyond the realm of the police power or palpably unreasonable. Because defendant had not demonstrated the unreasonableness of the ordinance, the court ruled that it was a reasonable exercise of legislative authority. Finally, the court rejected defendant's defense of &quot;unavoidable necessity,&quot; finding it inapplicable and incorporated within the reasonableness inquiry.

Defendant contended that the military duty performed by plaintiff did not constitute &quot;field training&quot; as contemplated under N.J. Rev.

The court agreed, construing the use of the descriptive phrase &quot;field training&quot; in &sect; 38:23-1 to mean only that training which consisted of participation in unit training in field operations, and finding that plaintiff's activities fell outside the purview of the statute as so interpreted. The court also determined defendant's attacks on the constitutionality of &sect; 38:23-1 lacked merit because the statute was enacted for a public purpose, had general application to all municipalities, and was general, not special, legislation.

On appeal, the court reversed, holding that the Tax Act, N. J. Rev. Stat. &sect;54:40 A-1 et seq., and the Unfair Cigarette Sales Act, N. J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 56:7-1, were unconstitutional. The court found that the various classifications contained in the Tax Act were not designed in any way to facilitate the levy and collection of the unit tax of 1 1/2 cent on each 10 cigarettes imposed by &sect; 8 of the act and resulted in the fixing of license fees based on arbitrary categories. The court also found that the business of dealing in cigarettes for sale, either wholesale or retail, did not in itself affect the public interest and was not subject to public regulation for the protection of that interest, and that traffic in cigarettes was not a business devoted to a public use and its use was thereby in effect granted to the public.

Appellant sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that it was unquestionable that respondent turnpike authority was acting within the scope of its statutory powers in determining upon the location and mode of construction of the Turnpike. The court held that the trial court properly concluded that the question on the motion for summary judgment was whether respondent turnpike authority, in adopting its plans, was guilty of a palpable abuse of discretion. The court held that the trial court properly used an &quot;abuse of discretion&quot; standard because respondent turnpike authority had a power that was primarily administrative and not legislative in nature, and the proper standard of review was abuse of discretion.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant landowners erected a fence in the approximate center of the alleyway between their lot and plaintiff adjoining landowner's lot. Approximately, 25 years earlier, a fence had been erected in the rear of the two properties, the boundaries of which encroached upon defendants' land. Plaintiff commenced suit against defendants, requesting that they be required to remove the fence in the alleyway, and defendants requested that plaintiff be required to remove the fence at the rear of the property. The trial court entered judgment in favor of plaintiff. Defendants sought review. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court held that plaintiff and his predecessors in title had a right to a prescriptive easement over the alleyway because they were adverse and uninterrupted users for 20 years or more. Likewise, the court held that plaintiff had acquired the land in the rear of the property by adverse possession because for 25 years there was an open, continuous, hostile, notorious holding of the property under claim of right. The court also held that defendants waived their rights to trial by jury and that the waiver was proper under the New Jersey Constitution.</SPAN></P>

Appellant contended that the office of sergeant-at-arms was in the classified civil service of the state because the provisions of &sect; 2:16-27 were subject to the 1908 Civil Service Act and the several amendments and supplements thereto. The trial court dismissed the complaint. On appeal, the court affirmed, although the trial court had dismissed the complaint on improper grounds, citing a statute that had been declared unconstitutional. The court held that the position was in the unclassified service of the Civil Service Act. The legislature, by chapter 140 of the Laws of 1950, expressly terminated the authority vested in the judges of the law division of the superior court to appoint sergeants-at-arms under the provisions of &sect; 2:16-27, and provided for a new method of appointment.

Respondent city clerk refused to accept appellant candidate's petition for his candidacy and the lower court upheld respondent's decision. The court affirmed the judgment of the lower court, holding that the two year residency requirement and the voting requirement contained in &sect; 40:72-1 were necessary qualifying conditions for appellant candidate's ability to run for the position of city commissioner and were constitutional under New Jersey's constitution. The court held that New Jersey's constitution placed restrictions upon the ability of voters to run for high elected office, and that it followed that the state was also permitted to place reasonable restrictions upon those who desired to run for city offices.

The court affirmed and held that teachers did not exercise governmental authority and that the purpose of the oath was not to probe the mind of the teacher for the punishment of unorthodox or heretical views and beliefs, but rather to determine the teacher's qualifications for the instruction of youth in the public schools. The court found that the test was largely subjective to forestall hostile action in an area deemed vital to the community and it was a reasonable accommodation of personal rights and common interest to disqualify because refusal to take the oath deemed the teacher unsuited for the instruction of youth in the schools supported by public funds.</SPAN></P>

The legislature had broad discretion to employ its police powers to regulate public safety and the statute was presumed to be valid because the service station operators failed to show that the statute was palpably unreasonable or unduly discriminatory so as to run afoul of U.S. Const. amend. V, XIV. The statute was found to be a regulation of management and conduct to safeguard persons and property against known perils of the gas station business. The legislature had the function and the responsibility of determining what was needed in the interest of the common safety. The burden of proof of a deviation from its constitutional sphere was not proved.</SPAN></P>

Defendant New Jersey State Board of Optometrists cross-appealed from the declaration of constitutional insufficiency as to the remainder of the statute and from the denial of its motion to dismiss.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiffs, corporation and optometrists, brought an action for declaratory relief against defendant New Jersey State Board of Optometrists, seeking to have N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45:12-1 et seq., regulating the practice of optometry, declared unconstitutional and its enforcement enjoined. Plaintiffs alleged that the provision unduly restricted the right of private property and was an arbitrary exercise by the state of its police power. After dismissing defendant's contention that sovereign immunity shielded the state from such an action, the court modified the judgment of the trial court, which sustained the constitutionality of portions of the disputed statutes and declared other portions unconstitutional. The court held that N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45:12-9, which forbade the issuance of more than two branch office registration certificates to one licensee, did not curtail the right arising under U.S. Const. amend. XIV to engage in a lawful business. The court then found N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45:12-11(o)&nbsp;unconstitutional for vagueness because it improperly utilized a subjective test of conduct with regard to defrauding the public.</SPAN></P>

Stat. &sect;&sect; 18:14-77 and -78, which generally provided that at least five verses from the Old Testament were to be read without comment in each public school classroom at the opening of school every school day, and provided that no religious service or exercise, except the reading of the Bible and the repeating of the Lord's Prayer, was to be held in any publicly supported school. The trial court held that the statutes were constitutional. On appeal, the court affirmed. The court rejected plaintiffs' contention that compliance with the statutes necessarily involved sectarian worship and sectarian instruction and therefore violated U.S. Const. amend. I. The court reasoned that there was no constitutional requirement that the existence of a Supreme Being should be negated and that the governmental recognition of God should be suppressed. The court noted that the U.S. Constitution itself assumed as an unquestioned fact the existence and authority of God.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant employer challenged two judgments of the Superior Court, Appellate Division (New Jersey).

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">In an arbitration proceeding between appellant employer and appellee union, a statutory board of arbitration (board) awarded appellee union, among other things, a wage increase, union security, check-off and a modified union shop, and a partial reclassification of various cities included in wage zones. That judgment was affirmed as modified by the appellate division. In another judgment, the appellate division denied appellant's motion for leave to take additional testimony. The court reversed and remanded the first judgment, which rendered the second judgment moot. The court held that the state statute dealing with labor disputes in public utilities was constitutional but that the awarding of a modified union shop was in conflict with &sect; 302 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.S. &sect; 141 et seq. The court held that the question of union security was not a labor dispute subject to compulsory arbitration. The court also found that the board's findings did not contain sufficient factual data for the court to determine whether the board's conclusions were predicated upon facts or speculation, and if upon facts, what facts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed suit against defendants, her brothers and sisters-in-law, alleging that they conspired to injure her marital relations with her husband by committing numerous acts. The trial judge struck the complaint as legally insufficient on the ground that the gravamen of the action was alienation of affection and was therefore barred by N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 2:39A-1 et seq., known as the &quot;Heart Balm Act&quot; (Act). The trial court also denied plaintiff's request to amend the complaint to state each of the alleged wrongs in separate counts. The appellate court affirmed the trial court's decision. The court took plaintiff's appeal due to an assertion that the Act was unconstitutional. The court held that it was unnecessary to consider the constitutional question as it believed the subject matter of the complaint did not involve the Act. The court concluded that the complaint attempted to assert causes of action that were outside the Act. As such, the pleading should not have been stricken and leave should have instead been given to amend it in accordance with plaintiff's motion to set forth such causes clearly, specifically, and in separate counts.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant sought review of the lower court's order directing him to specifically perform under an agreement for purchase of certain real property from plaintiff, the City of Newark.

Foreclosure proceedings to bar the right of redemption were conducted by plaintiff under the In Rem Tax Foreclosure Act (Act), N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:5-104.29 et seq.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff grand jury target, whose action to expunge an alleged libel on him from a grand jury report transmitted to defendant county clerk was rejected on summary grounds, challenged an intermediate appellate panel's decision dismissing his appeal. The court affirmed on the grounds that the appeal was untimely. Plaintiff argued that the fact that his appeal was taken within the time set by statute for taking an appeal meant that his appeal was timely, and thus that dismissal was improper. The court rejected this argument, noting that it was for the state supreme court, and not the legislature, to set procedural rules. The state constitution's use of the phrase &quot;subject to law,&quot; within the limits of which the state supreme court's rule-making authority must be exercised, did not mean subject to statutory law. Consequently, the court rule setting a short appeal time than set by statute prevailed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant, a railroad company, sought review of the lower court's judgment affirming the decision of Board of Public Utility Commissioners (board) directing appellant to continue to operate its trains on two routes. The lower court, in deference to established case law, held that appellant was required to continue operation of the trains. Appellant requested that the appellate court overrule the previous case law. Appellant urged that the lower court's decision directed appellant to continue operation of the two routes at a loss amounted to a taking of appellant's property in violation of the state and federal constitutions. Appellant also alleged that the lower court's decision placed an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the federal constitution. The appellate court found that the preexisting case law should be overruled because appellant was under no obligation to keep running a route where there was no demonstrated public necessity. The court also held that the lower court's decision amounted to a deprivation of appellant's property, and an undue burden on appellant's interstate operations. As such, the court reversed the lower court's decision.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed and vacated the lower court's decision. The court overruled previous case law after determining that a public utility could not be required to continue operation if there was no demonstrated public necessity. The court also found the lower court's decision to be a taking of appellant railroad company's property in violation of both state and federal constitutions.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant patrolman was orally hired by city officials as a permanent patrolman in 1944, but the official documents pertaining to his hiring referred to him as a special patrolman. Defendant worked three years as a permanent patrolman before the mayor retroactively appointed him as a permanent patrolman, beginning with the date of his original hire. Plaintiff corporation filed an action in the nature of quo warranto challenging defendant's fitness to hold office. The lower court held that defendant was properly qualified as a patrolman, but the court reversed. The court held that only the official minutes of the municipality were admissible in evidence and that the official minutes showed that defendant's hire was not permanent. The court ruled that when the mayor attempted to make defendant's position retroactively permanent that defendant was 33 years old and, thus, his appointment violated N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:47-4, which forbade the hiring of anyone over 30 for a patrolman's office. Therefore, defendant was not qualified to hold office as a patrolman.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court reversed the decision of the lower court, which had held that defendant patrolman was qualified for his office. The court sustained plaintiff corporation's objections to defendant's hiring, finding that defendant was never properly appointed as a permanent patrolman in the past and that his employment violated the law prohibiting the hiring of a patrolman over 30 years of age.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, creditor and trustee in bankruptcy, filed a motion for payment of attorney fees in the trial court after appellant, trustee in bankruptcy, was awarded judgment as representative of all of the creditors of the bankrupt debtor.

The newly created Supreme Court was empowered to promulgate such rules as it deemed necessary to accomplish an orderly transfer of power and cases to the new courts, and continue the effective administration of justice.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellants, owners of industrial machinery, sought review of the order of the Hudson County Court (New Jersey), which rendered a verdict in favor of respondent corporate broker, which had filed an action for payment of its brokerage fee under an oral contract with appellants to sell their industrial machinery.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent corporate broker established that it had an oral contract with appellants, owners of industrial machinery, under which appellants would pay respondent a fee if it found a buyer for appellants' machinery. Respondent found a buyer, but appellants refused to sell. Respondent filed an action to collect the fee, and a jury rendered a verdict in its favor. The court affirmed, holding that appellants' objection to a jury instruction was properly overruled, because appellants' pleadings did not establish the defense on which they wished the jury to be instructed, and they did not timely object to the failure to charge. The fact that respondent's corporate charter had been temporarily voided for failure to pay state taxes, and later reinstated, did not affect its ability to contract with appellants during the applicable time period. N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 54:11-5 provided for reinstatement upon payment of back taxes. If respondent had no corporate existence at all after its charter was voided, its reinstatement would have required legislative action under N.J. Const. art. IV, &sect; 7(9). The court held that the reinstatement related back to the date the charter was voided.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The court affirmed the judgment in favor of respondent corporate broker in its action against appellants, owners of industrial machinery, for payment of a brokerage fee that appellants owed it for obtaining a buyer for machinery. The fact that respondent's corporate charter was temporarily revoked for non-payment of taxes did not render appellants' obligation to it void.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Respondent New Jersey Turnpike Authority sought a declaratory judgment to determine the constitutionality of the New Jersey Turnpike Authority Act, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27:23-1 et seq. The trial court sustained the constitutionality of the act, and appellant state highway commissioner petitioned for certification. Appellant argued that the act violated N.J. Const. art. VIII, &sect; 2, paras. 1 and 3 because the state was responsible for respondent's debts and appellant had advanced money to respondent. The supreme court found that the New Jersey Turnpike Authority Act, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27:23-17, was unconstitutional because appellant did not have the right to divert funds it was appropriated to respondent or to render services for a project that is not within the scope of its duties; however, &sect; 27:23-17 was severable from the remaining provisions of the act. As modified by the severance of &sect; 27:23-17, the supreme court affirmed the trial court's judgment that the act was constitutional because the legislative intent was plain under the Act, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 27:23-2, that respondent was not authorized to incur any indebtedness on behalf of the state.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Petitioner employee was injured while working for respondent employer, who was also his wife, and sought benefits under the Workmen's Compensation Act, N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 34:15-7 et seq. The trial court denied benefits because of the marital relationship. On appeal, the court affirmed because a husband and wife were legally incapable of contracting with one another and a contract of hire was an essential prerequisite for benefits. The court held that while some agreements between spouses were enforceable in equity, the compensation scheme was a creature of statute and courts of equity could not change rights created by the legislature. The court held that since a contract of hire between spouses was utterly void and unenforceable at law, petitioner had no right to benefits. The principles of estoppel did not apply because there was no evidence that the insurer knew of the marital relationship or that the insurer induced petitioner to make a harmful change of position. The court determined that any remedy had to come from the legislature, not the courts.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellee Division of Tax Appeals, Department of Taxation and Finance ruled that appellant railroad companies could not reduce the next year's excise tax by deducting as expenses back taxes and associated interest or taxes paid under protest then later refunded. The court affirmed, and held that prior years' unpaid back taxes and associated accrued interest were not deductible as railway tax accruals from net operating income as determined by the Railway Tax Act, N.J. Stat. Ann. &sect; 54:29A-1 et seq., which measured the railroads excise tax by the preceding year's net operating income. The court rejected appellants' contention that appellee's order was an arbitrary increase of operating income, and found that appellee merely confined the tax base to appellant's income actually earned during the year. The court found that the interest should have been charged to a non-operating income account because it was not a tax actually assessed and levied. The court also found that appellants' taxes paid under protest for a prior year and later refunded were not properly deductible as railway tax accruals in computing a later year's franchise tax because the amount was never due and payable.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was convicted of second degree murder in the death of his wife. He challenged his conviction. The court held that the search of defendant's house and removal of items without a search warrant was a collateral attack which would not serve to void his conviction. The court held that he could not, once his application for auxiliary relief for the alleged wrongful search and seizure was denied, abandon his right to appeal and make this an error to serve as a basis for setting aside his conviction. The court held that the admission of the death certificate was proper as the lower court instructed that it was admissible as a public record only but the facts thereon were not conceded. The state properly introduced evidence of prior beatings defendant committed on his wife, as they went to show malice towards her. Because there was enough evidence that the jury could have inferred guilt, the fact that the state's case rested mostly on circumstantial evidence was not an issue. Because all circumstances indicated his guilt and were inconsistent with any other rational conclusion, the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence and the court affirmed the conviction.</SPAN></P>

The chancery court transferred the action to the law division, contending that the matter was no longer one which could be determined by the equity court. Plaintiffs appealed the transfer.

<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant taxpayer sought review of a decision of the former Supreme Court (New Jersey), which affirmed respondent Division of Tax Appeals' decision that found that the property in question was either properly excluded from taxation or was exempted from taxation under N.J.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The city owned a piece of property which it leased to a company which built a factory thereon. Appellant taxpayer petitioned for an assessment of the property. Respondent Division of Tax Appeals found that the property was either properly excluded from taxation or was exempt from taxation under N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 54:4-3.3, which decision was affirmed on appeal. Appellant again sought review. The court reversed and held that the property was subject to taxation. The court found that the property's use was commercial and private, there was no prospect of possible future public use within the terms of the lease, and the city's receipt of rentals did not transform the private use into a public use. The court held that the lease provision which stated that any buildings erected on the property became the property of the city did not create tax immunity for the building thereon, nor did it prove the city owned the building. Because the property was not owned or used publicly, it did not qualify for an exemption under the statute, and the court remanded for the property to be taxed.</SPAN></P>

The court agreed with appellant taxpayer that the property did not qualify for an exemption under the statute, as it was not publicly owned or used. The court held that the city's receipt of rentals on the building from the lessee did not transform the private use of the property into a public one.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant union went on strike against defendant telephone company and declined to participate in arbitration proceedings. The governor authorized the Commissioner of Labor to carry on the operations of defendant. Defendants, several unions, challenged the declaratory judgment in an action brought by plaintiff, the State of New Jersey, as to the constitutionality of the act dealing with labor disputes in public utilities (the act), R.S. 34:13B-1 et seq. On review, the court found that the act should be set aside. The court rejected the charge by defendants that the act was unconstitutional in that it imposed involuntary servitude in violation of U.S. Const. amend. XIII. The court found that the act inevitably impinged upon the exercise of some of the constitutional guarantees asserted by defendants but that such restraints were justifiable in the public interest of the state. However, the court held that the act's provisions for compulsory arbitration were unconstitutional because they delegated legislative power to an administrative agency without setting up adequate standards to guide the agency in the exercise of its' power and without such provisions the act could not operate.</SPAN></P>

Rev. Stat. &sect; 43:21-19.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The industrial life insurance agents in the service of the company were defined as &quot;employees&quot; pursuant to N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 43:21-19. On appeal, the issue was the constitutional sufficiency of the statute as amended by 1941 N.J. Laws 385 to include industrial life insurance agents, but to exclude all other types of insurance agents. The court agreed with the company that the inclusion of industrial life insurance agents alone served to deny the company due process of law and the equal protection of the laws. The amendment constituted special legislation that granted to a certain class an exclusive privilege or immunity, arbitrarily and capriciously, without a logical and reasonable basis in fact. The court found that the classification was plainly illusory. There was no rational basis for the exclusion of industrial insurance agents from the excepted class. The court also found that because the amendment of 1941 was ineffective, the allowance of unemployment compensation benefits made to the agents was permissible under the law as it stood, unaffected by the amendment. The judgment below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment granting unemployment compensation benefits to the agents was affirmed because, although a statutory amendment was unconstitutional in that it denied the insurance company the rights of due process and equal protection, existing law permitted an award of benefits.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The concrete company began operating a plant that manufactured concrete slabs, in a commercial area on land adjacent to a residential area, without seeking approval of the land use from appellant borough authorities. His operation violated Borough of Cresskill, N.J., Ordinances art. IV, &sect; 4 , in that it employed more people and ran more powerful machinery than the ordinance allowed. The borough denied the company's eventual application for a variance, and the trial court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional. The court reversed, holding that there was no constitutional or statutory provision that compelled a city to set apart an area for heavy industry. Pursuant N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 40:55-32, the borough could pass zoning ordinances that took into account the character of the district and its suitability for particular uses, with a view to conserve the property value and encourage the most appropriate use of its land. The borough adopted a plan that took into account the best area for industrial purposes and provided for the grant of variances.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant dentist's license was suspended for six months by respondent, State Board of Registration and Examination in Dentistry, after it determined that he was employed by an unlicensed manager. The trial court found that N.J. Rev. Stat. &sect; 45:6-7(h), the applicable statute, was unconstitutional and set the suspension aside. The reviewing court held that the part of the statute that provided that a dentist's license could be suspended if he was employed by an unlicensed manager was constitutional and remanded the matter to the trial court for hearing. The trial court affirmed the suspension, and the court affirmed. The court held that appellant only nominally operated the office and that it was in fact run by corporations owned and operated by a person who was not a dentist. This person hired and fired, was the holder of the lease, he &quot;sublet&quot; the office to appellant, and demanded daily print-outs of all revenue, including the revenue that came in under credit contracts that he discounted, and non-credit revenue in which he had no ownership interest. Thus, the decision was supported by sufficient evidence. The court held that it would not revisit the constitutional challenge.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">By an amendatory ordinance adopted by defendant city, a certain area was rezoned from an industrial to a residence zone. Plaintiff later acquired a lot within that rezoned area, upon which she applied for a permit to construct a gasoline filling station. Defendant, the city's building inspector, refused to issue the permit on the ground that gasoline filling stations were not permitted in such residential zones. A writ of certiorari was granted to review that refusal, but the former Supreme Court thereafter dismissed the writ on the ground that there was no unnecessary hardship demonstrated for a variance. On appeal, the court held that the court below lacked jurisdiction and should not have undertaken to consider plaintiff's application for a variance, in that such was a matter for the local board of adjustment to decide. However, as the constitutionality of the ordinance was properly raised by the writ, the court also found that plaintiff had not met her burden of establishing that that the ordinance was unreasonable. Furthermore, the ordinance did not violate the constitutional guaranties upon which plaintiff relied in challenging it. As such, the judgment below was affirmed.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Appellant sought review of a judgment of the Supreme Court (New Jersey), which dismissed a writ of certiorari to review ordinances of respondent city that provided for the acquisition of land by respondent city, and for a contract between respondent city and respondent corporation for the construction and lease of housing on the land. Appellant claimed that the ordinances were an unconstitutional taking and expenditure for a private use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Pursuant to the Urban Redevelopment Law of 1946, N.J. Pamph. L. ch. 52 (1946), respondent city adopted ordinances authorizing it to acquire land and then enter into contracts whereby respondent corporation would build housing on the land, would lease the housing from respondent city for a stated term at a stated rent, and would exempt the housing from taxes. Appellant challenged the constitutionality of the law and ordinances on the ground that they authorized a taking of land for a private purpose, namely housing, and exempted private housing from taxation. The court affirmed denial of certiorari. The statute and ordinances did not constitute a donation of property by respondent city to respondent corporation. Their purpose was to remedy a situation, namely lack of housing, that constituted a danger to public health and welfare. The leases provided respondent city more in rent than it would receive by way of taxes if the land in question were in private use.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The judgment dismissing the writ of certiorari by appellant was affirmed. The ordinances and the statute under which they were adopted served a public purpose and did not involve the donation of property by respondent city to respondent corporation for a private purpose. The court found that there was no authorization of a taking for a private purpose where it was remedying public problems.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Defendant was charged in the Hamilton Township Municipal Court (New Jersey) with possession of under 50 grams of marijuana. His motion to suppress was denied, and his sentence was stayed. After a trial de novo in the Law Division, the judge imposed the same sentence as that of the municipal court.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">At 12:32 a.m., defendant and a friend were sitting in defendant's car in the parking lot of a tavern. The tavern was open and there were several other vehicles in the lot. An officer approached, and the stop culminated in a search of the car. Defendant was arrested after admitting he possessed marijuana. The appellate court held there was an illegal detention of defendant either from the beginning of the encounter or sometime after. The result of this detention was an admission by defendant that he possessed marijuana and his consent to search the vehicle for it. Since neither of these acts was preceded by some intervening circumstance, the statement should have been excluded and the consent considered invalid. The officer, without any lawful justification for his presence or the detention of defendant, should not have conducted the search or solicited defendant to turn over the drugs.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">The conviction was reversed. Defendant's motion to suppress should have been granted, since the stop and detention of defendant was unlawful.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">PROCEDURAL POSTURE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff appealed a judgment of the Superior Court of New Jersey, Law Division, Monmouth County, which granted two defendants' motions for summary judgment in plaintiff's personal injury action on grounds that the statute of limitations had expired.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OVERVIEW: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Plaintiff filed a personal injury suit against several defendants for their part in a shooting that rendered plaintiff a paraplegic. After the shooting had occurred in New Jersey, all defendants fled to New York City. Identity of plaintiff's assailants remained unknown to plaintiff until over four years after the incident. Plaintiff's personal injury complaint was filed shortly after discovering defendants' identities. Summary judgment was granted to two defendants. On appeal, the issue was whether plaintiff had to resort to the fictitious party rule before he could benefit from the statute that tolled the personal injury statute of limitations. The court reversed, holding that plaintiff was not required to utilize the fictitious party practice prior to learning the identity of the out-of-state defendants because the tolling statute applied to the defendants who removed themselves from New Jersey, and consciously conducted their affairs to remain out of the state.</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c5"><P CLASS="c6"><SPAN CLASS="c7">OUTCOME: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c8">Judgment reversed and case was remanded; plaintiff was not required to utilize the fictitious party practice in his personal injury action because the statutory tolling provision was invoked due to the absence of defendants from New Jersey and the plaintiff's inability to affect long-arm service over them.</SPAN></P>
